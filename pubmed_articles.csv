Tracer Kinetic Modeling in PET,"M'hamed Bentourkia, Habib Zaidi","Molecular imaging using PET provides a unique tool for noninvasively investigating the biochemistry of living organs. The wide range of radiolabeled molecules makes it possible to explore various biochemical, physiologic, and pharmacologic processes in vivo. Because each radiotracer is characterized by its particular kinetic behavior in the human body, the quantification of this behavior is a critical component for the improvement of imaging protocols and for rapid translation from research and development to the clinic. Suitable image reconstruction algorithms combined with tracer kinetic modeling techniques are needed to assess parametric or quantitative biologic images from the available fourdimensional images. An appropriate mathematical model is generally used to fit the time-activity curves of a region or volume of interest, thus allowing the assessment of biologic parameters.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27157877/
Total-Body PET Kinetic Modeling and Potential Opportunities Using Deep Learning,"Yiran Wang, Elizabeth Li, Simon R Cherry, Guobao Wang","The uEXPLORER total-body PET/CT system provides a very high level of detection sensitivity and simultaneous coverage of the entire body for dynamic imaging for quantification of tracer kinetics. This article describes the fundamentals and potential benefits of total-body kinetic modeling and parametric imaging focusing on the noninvasive derivation of blood input function, multiparametric imaging, and high-temporal resolution kinetic modeling. Along with its attractive properties, total-body kinetic modeling also brings significant challenges, such as the large scale of total-body dynamic PET data, the need for organ and tissue appropriate input functions and kinetic models, and total-body motion correction. These challenges, and the opportunities using deep learning, are discussed.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34353745/
Machine learning methods for tracer kinetic modelling,"Isabelle Miederer, Kuangyu Shi, Thomas Wendler","Tracer kinetic modelling based on dynamic PET is an important field of Nuclear Medicine for quantitative functional imaging. Yet, its implementation in clinical routine has been constrained by its complexity and computational costs. Machine learning poses an opportunity to improve modelling processes in terms of arterial input function prediction, the prediction of kinetic modelling parameters and model selection in both clinical and preclinical studies while reducing processing time. Moreover, it can help improving kinetic modelling data used in downstream tasks such as tumor detection. In this review, we introduce the basics of tracer kinetic modelling and present a literature review of original works and conference papers using machine learning methods in this field.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37820696/
Kinetic modeling in PET imaging of hypoxia,"Fan Li, Jesper T Joergensen, Anders E Hansen, Andreas Kjaer","Tumor hypoxia is associated with increased therapeutic resistance leading to poor treatment outcome. Therefore the ability to detect and quantify intratumoral oxygenation could play an important role in future individual personalized treatment strategies. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) can be used for non-invasive mapping of tissue oxygenation in vivo and several hypoxia specific PET tracers have been developed. Evaluation of PET data in the clinic is commonly based on visual assessment together with semiquantitative measurements e.g. standard uptake value (SUV). However, dynamic PET contains additional valuable information on the temporal changes in tracer distribution. Kinetic modeling can be used to extract relevant pharmacokinetic parameters of tracer behavior in vivo that reflects relevant physiological processes. In this paper, we review the potential contribution of kinetic analysis for PET imaging of hypoxia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25250200/
Comparison of Tracer Kinetic Models for 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET in Intermediate Risk Primary Prostate Cancer Patients,"Nathaniel J Smith, Mark A Green, Clinton D Bahler, Mark Tann, Wendy Territo, Anne M Smith, Gary D Hutchins","Background: 68Ga-PSMA-11 positron emission tomography enables the detection of primary, recurrent, and metastatic prostate cancer. Regional radiopharmaceutical uptake is generally evaluated in static images and quantified as standard uptake values (SUV) for clinical decision-making. However, analysis of dynamic images characterizing both tracer uptake and pharmacokinetics may offer added insights into the underlying tissue pathophysiology. This study was undertaken to evaluate the suitability of various kinetic models for68Ga-PSMA-11 PET analysis. Twenty-three lesions in 18 patients were included in a retrospective kinetic evaluation of 55-minute dynamic68Ga-PSMA-11 pre-prostatectomy PET scans from patients with biopsy-demonstrated intermediate to high-risk prostate cancer. A reversible one-tissue compartment model, irreversible two-tissue compartment model, and a reversible two-tissue compartment model were evaluated for their goodness-of-fit to lesion and normal reference prostate time-activity curves. Kinetic parameters obtained through graphical analysis and tracer kinetic modeling techniques were compared for reference prostate tissue and lesion regions of interest.

Results: Supported by goodness-of-fit and information loss criteria, the irreversible two-tissue compartment model was selected as optimally fitting the time-activity curves. Lesions exhibited significant differences in kinetic rate constants (K1, k2, k3, Ki) and semiquantitative measures (SUV) when compared with reference prostatic tissue. The two-tissue irreversible tracer kinetic model was consistently appropriate across prostatic zones.

Conclusions: An irreversible tracer kinetic model is appropriate for dynamic analysis of68Ga-PSMA-11 PET images. Kinetic parameters estimated by Patlak graphical analysis or full compartmental analysis can distinguish tumor from normal prostate tissue.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37961116/
High-Temporal-Resolution Lung Kinetic Modeling Using Total-Body Dynamic PET with Time-Delay and Dispersion Corrections,"Yiran Wang, Benjamin A Spencer, Jeffrey Schmall, Elizabeth Li, Ramsey D Badawi, Terry Jones, Simon R Cherry, Guobao Wang","Tracer kinetic modeling in dynamic PET has the potential to improve the diagnosis, prognosis, and research of lung diseases. The advent of total-body PET systems with much greater detection sensitivity enables high-temporal-resolution (HTR) dynamic PET imaging of the lungs. However, existing models may become insufficient for modeling the HTR data. In this paper, we investigate the necessity of additional corrections to the input function for HTR lung kinetic modeling.Methods:Dynamic scans with HTR frames of as short as 1 s were performed on 13 healthy subjects with a bolus injection of about [Formula: see text] of18F-FDG using the uEXPLORER total-body PET/CT system. Three kinetic models with and without time-delay and dispersion corrections were compared for the quality of lung time-activity curve fitting using the Akaike information criterion. The impact on quantification of18F-FDG delivery rate [Formula: see text], net influx rate [Formula: see text] and fractional blood volume [Formula: see text] was assessed. Parameter identifiability analysis was also performed to evaluate the reliability of kinetic quantification with respect to noise. Correlation of kinetic parameters with age was investigated.Results:HTR dynamic imaging clearly revealed the rapid change in tracer concentration in the lungs and blood supply (i.e., the right ventricle). The uncorrected input function led to poor time-activity curve fitting and biased quantification in HTR kinetic modeling. The fitting was improved by time-delay and dispersion corrections. The proposed model resulted in an approximately 85% decrease in [Formula: see text], an approximately 75% increase in [Formula: see text], and a more reasonable [Formula: see text] (∼0.14) than the uncorrected model (∼0.04). The identifiability analysis showed that the proposed models had good quantification stability for [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], and [Formula: see text] The [Formula: see text] estimated by the proposed model with simultaneous time-delay and dispersion corrections correlated inversely with age, as would be expected.Conclusion:Corrections to the input function are important for accurate lung kinetic analysis of HTR dynamic PET data. The modeling of both delay and dispersion can improve model fitting and significantly impact quantification of [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], and [Formula: see text].",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37116916/
Kinetic Modeling of the Tau PET Tracer 18F-AV-1451 in Human Healthy Volunteers and Alzheimer Disease Subjects,"Olivier Barret, David Alagille, Sandra Sanabria, Robert A Comley, Robby M Weimer, Edilio Borroni, Mark Mintun, Nicholas Seneca, Caroline Papin, Thomas Morley, Ken Marek, John P Seibyl, Gilles D Tamagnan, Danna Jennings","18F-AV-1451 is currently the most widely used of several experimental tau PET tracers. The objective of this study was to evaluate18F-AV-1451 binding with full kinetic analysis using a metabolite-corrected arterial input function and to compare parameters derived from kinetic analysis with SUV ratio (SUVR) calculated over different imaging time intervals.Methods:18F-AV-1451 PET brain imaging was completed in 16 subjects: 4 young healthy volunteers (YHV), 4 aged healthy volunteers (AHV), and 8 Alzheimer disease (AD) subjects. Subjects were imaged for 3.5 h, with arterial blood samples obtained throughout. PET data were analyzed using plasma and reference tissue-based methods to estimate the distribution volume, binding potential (BPND), and SUVR. BPNDand SUVR were calculated using the cerebellar cortex as a reference region and were compared across the different methods and across the 3 groups (YHV, AHV, and AD).Results:AD demonstrated increased18F-AV-1451 retention compared with YHV and AHV based on both invasive and noninvasive analyses in cortical regions in which paired helical filament tau accumulation is expected in AD. A correlation ofR2> 0.93 was found between BPND(130 min) and SUVR-1 at all time intervals. Cortical SUVR curves reached a relative plateau around 1.0-1.2 for YHV and AHV by approximately 50 min, but increased in AD by up to approximately 20% at 110-130 min and approximately 30% at 160-180 min relative to 80-100 min. Distribution volume (130 min) was lower by 30%-35% in the YHV than AHV.Conclusion:Our data suggest that although18F-AV-1451 SUVR curves do not reach a plateau and are still increasing in AD, an SUVR calculated over an imaging window of 80-100 min (as currently used in clinical studies) provides estimates of paired helical filament tau burden in good correlation with BPND, whereas SUVR sensitivity to regional cerebral blood changes needs further investigation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27908967/
"Pharmacokinetic Modeling of [11C]GSK-189254, PET Tracer Targeting H3 Receptors, in Rat Brain","Nafiseh Ghazanfari, Aren van Waarde, Janine Doorduin, Jürgen W A Sijbesma, Maria Kominia, Martin Koelewijn, Khaled Attia, Antoon T M Willemsen, Ton J Visser, André Heeres, Rudi A J O Dierckx, Erik F J de Vries, Philip H Elsinga","The histamine H3receptor has been considered as a target for the treatment of various central nervous system diseases. Positron emission tomography (PET) studies with the radiolabeled potent and selective histamine H3receptor antagonist [11C]GSK-189254 in rodents could be used to examine the mechanisms of action of novel therapeutic drugs or to assess changes of regional H3receptor density in animal models of neurodegenerative disease. [11C]GSK-189254 was intravenously administered to healthy Wistar rats (n= 10), and a 60 min dynamic PET scan was carried out. Arterial blood samples were obtained during the scan to generate a metabolite-corrected plasma input function. PET data were analyzed using a one-tissue compartment model (1T2k), irreversible (2T3k) or reversible two-tissue compartment models (2T4k), graphical analysis (Logan and Patlak), reference tissue models (SRTM and SRTM2), and standard uptake values (SUVs). The Akaike information criterion and the standard error of the estimated parameters were used to select the most optimal quantification method. This study demonstrated that the 2T4k model with a fixed blood volume fraction and Logan graphical analysis can best describe the kinetics of [11C]GSK-189254 in the rat brain. SUV40-60and the reference tissue-based measurements DVR(2T4k), BPND(SRTM), and SUV ratio could also be used as a simplified method to estimate H3receptor availability in case blood sampling is not feasible.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35170965/
MRI-Guided Derivation of the Input Function for PET Kinetic Modeling,"Marie Anne Richard, Jérémie P Fouquet, Réjean Lebel, Martin Lepage","Blood samples obtained by arterial cannulation are the gold standard to measure the input function for PET pharmacokinetic modeling. There is interest in less invasive methods, such as image-derived input functions (IDAIF). MRI can be used to segment and correct partial volume effects of the PET images, improving IDAIF extraction. Preclinical studies have shown that the input function of PET tracers, namely fluorodeoxyglucose and [(18)F]fluoroethyl-l-tyrosine, can be derived from the Gd-DTPA input function. Noninvasive, MRI-guided, PET input function derivation is a promising avenue to reduce or eliminate the need for arterial plasma samples in preclinical and clinical settings.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26952731/
Validation of Noninvasive Tracer Kinetic Analysis of 18F-Florbetaben PET Using a Dual-Time-Window Acquisition Protocol,"Santiago Bullich, Henryk Barthel, Norman Koglin, Georg A Becker, Susan De Santi, Aleksandar Jovalekic, Andrew W Stephens, Osama Sabri","Accurate amyloid PET quantification is necessary for monitoring amyloid-β accumulation and response to therapy. Currently, most of the studies are analyzed using the static SUV ratio (SUVR) approach because of its simplicity. However, this approach may be influenced by changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF) or radiotracer clearance. Full tracer kinetic models require arterial blood sampling and dynamic image acquisition. The objectives of this work were, first, to validate a noninvasive kinetic modeling approach for18F-florbetaben PET using an acquisition protocol with the best compromise between quantification accuracy and simplicity and, second, to assess the impact of CBF changes and radiotracer clearance on SUVRs and noninvasive kinetic modeling data in18F-florbetaben PET.Methods:Using data from 20 subjects (10 patients with probable Alzheimer dementia and 10 healthy volunteers), the nondisplaceable binding potential (BPND) obtained from the full kinetic analysis was compared with the SUVR and with noninvasive tracer kinetic methods (simplified reference tissue model and multilinear reference tissue model 2). Various approaches using shortened or interrupted acquisitions were compared with the results of the full acquisition (0-140 min). Simulations were performed to assess the effect of CBF and radiotracer clearance changes on SUVRs and noninvasive kinetic modeling outputs.Results:An acquisition protocol using time windows of 0-30 and 120-140 min with appropriate interpolation of the missing time points provided the best compromise between patient comfort and quantification accuracy. Excellent agreement was found between BPNDobtained using the full protocol and BPNDobtained using the dual-window protocol (for multilinear reference tissue model 2, BPND[dual-window] = 0.01 + 1.00·BPND[full],R2= 0.97; for simplified reference tissue model, BPND[dual-window] = 0.05 + 0.92·BPND[full],R2= 0.93). Simulations showed a limited impact of CBF and radiotracer clearance changes on multilinear reference tissue model parameters and SUVR.Conclusion:This study demonstrated accurate noninvasive kinetic modeling of18F-florbetaben PET data using a dual-window acquisition, thus providing a good compromise between quantification accuracy, scan duration, and patient burden. The influence of CBF and radiotracer clearance changes on amyloid-β load estimates was small. For most clinical research applications, the SUVR approach is appropriate. However, for longitudinal studies in which maximum quantification accuracy is desired, this noninvasive dual-window acquisition with kinetic analysis is recommended.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29175981/
Optimized Methodology for Reference Region and Image-Derived Input Function Kinetic Modeling in Preclinical PET,"Jason Bini, Christine R Lattin, Takuya Toyonaga, Sjoerd J Finnema, Richard Carson","PET imaging of small animals is often used for assessing biodistribution of a novel radioligand and pharmacology in small animal models of disease. PET acquisition and processing settings may affect reference region or image-derived input function (IDIF) kinetic modeling estimates. We examined four different factors in comparing quantitative results: 1) effect of reconstruction algorithm, 2) number of MAP iterations, 3) strength of the MAP prior, and 4) Attenuation and scatter. The effect of these parameters has not been explored for small-animal reference region and IDIF kinetic modeling approaches. Dynamic PET/CT scans were performed in 3 species with 3 different tracers: house sparrows with [11C]raclopride, rats with [18F]AS2471907 (11βHSD1) and mice with [11C]UCB-J (SV2A). FBP yielded lower kinetic modeling estimates compared to 3D-OSEM-MAP reconstructions, in sparrow and rat studies. Target resolutions (MAP prior strength) of 1.5 and 3.0mm demonstrated reducedin rats but only 3.0mm reduced BPNDin sparrows. Therefore, use of the highest target resolution (0.8mm) is warranted. We demonstrated using kinetic modeling that forgoing CT-based attenuation and scatter correction may be appropriate to improve animal throughput when using short-lived radioisotopes in sparrows and mice. This work provides recommendations and a framework for future optimization of kinetic modeling for preclinical PET methodology with novel radioligands.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36185820/
Spatiotemporal distribution modeling of PET tracer uptake in solid tumors,"Madjid Soltani, Mostafa Sefidgar, Hossein Bazmara, Michael E Casey, Rathan M Subramaniam, Richard L Wahl, Arman Rahmim","Objective: Distribution of PET tracer uptake is elaborately modeled via a general equation used for solute transport modeling. This model can be used to incorporate various transport parameters of a solid tumor such as hydraulic conductivity of the microvessel wall, transvascular permeability as well as interstitial space parameters. This is especially significant because tracer delivery and drug delivery to solid tumors are determined by similar underlying tumor transport phenomena, and quantifying the former can enable enhanced prediction of the latter.

Methods: We focused on the commonly utilized FDG PET tracer. First, based on a mathematical model of angiogenesis, the capillary network of a solid tumor and normal tissues around it were generated. The coupling mathematical method, which simultaneously solves for blood flow in the capillary network as well as fluid flow in the interstitium, is used to calculate pressure and velocity distributions. Subsequently, a comprehensive spatiotemporal distribution model (SDM) is applied to accurately model distribution of PET tracer uptake, specifically FDG in this work, within solid tumors.

Results: The different transport mechanisms, namely convention and diffusion from vessel to tissue and in tissue, are elaborately calculated across the domain of interest and effect of each parameter on tracer distribution is investigated. The results show the convection terms to have negligible effect on tracer transport and the SDM can be solved after eliminating these terms.

Conclusion: The proposed framework of spatiotemporal modeling for PET tracers can be utilized to comprehensively assess the impact of various parameters on the spatiotemporal distribution of PET tracers.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27921285/

Application of separable parameter space techniques to multi-tracer PET compartment modeling,"Jeff L Zhang, A Michael Morey, Dan J Kadrmas","Multi-tracer positron emission tomography (PET) can image two or more tracers in a single scan, characterizing multiple aspects of biological functions to provide new insights into many diseases. The technique uses dynamic imaging, resulting in time-activity curves that contain contributions from each tracer present. The process of separating and recovering separate images and/or imaging measures for each tracer requires the application of kinetic constraints, which are most commonly applied by fitting parallel compartment models for all tracers. Such multi-tracer compartment modeling presents challenging nonlinear fits in multiple dimensions. This work extends separable parameter space kinetic modeling techniques, previously developed for fitting single-tracer compartment models, to fitting multi-tracer compartment models. The multi-tracer compartment model solution equations were reformulated to maximally separate the linear and nonlinear aspects of the fitting problem, and separable least-squares techniques were applied to effectively reduce the dimensionality of the nonlinear fit. The benefits of the approach are then explored through a number of illustrative examples, including characterization of separable parameter space multi-tracer objective functions and demonstration of exhaustive search fits which guarantee the true global minimum to within arbitrary search precision. Iterative gradient-descent algorithms using Levenberg-Marquardt were also tested, demonstrating improved fitting speed and robustness as compared to corresponding fits using conventional model formulations. The proposed technique overcomes many of the challenges in fitting simultaneous multi-tracer PET compartment models.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26788888/
Development of a PET Tracer for OGA with Improved Kinetics in the Living Brain,"Brendon E Cook, Sangram Nag, Ryosuke Arakawa, Edward Yin-Shiang Lin, Nancy Stratman, Kevin Guckian, Heike Hering, Mukesh Lulla, Jinkuk Choi, Cristian Salinas, Nathan E Genung, Anton Forsberg Morén, Martin Bolin, Giulia Boscutti, Christophe Plisson, Laurent Martarello, Christer Halldin, Maciej A Kaliszczak","O-GlcNAcylation is thought to play a role in the development of tau pathology in Alzheimer's disease because of its ability to modulate tau's aggregation propensity.O-GlcNAcylation is regulated by 2 enzymes:O-GlcNAc transferase andO-GlcNAcase (OGA). Development of a PET tracer would therefore be an essential tool for developing therapeutic small-molecule inhibitors of OGA, enabling clinical testing of target engagement and dose selection.Methods:A collection of small-molecule compounds was screened for inhibitory activity and high-affinity binding to OGA, as well as favorable PET tracer attributes (multidrug resistance protein 1 efflux, central nervous system PET multiparameter optimization, etc.). Two lead compounds with high affinity and selectivity for OGA were selected for further profiling, including OGA binding to tissue homogenate using a radioligand competition binding assay. In vivo pharmacokinetics were established using a microdosing approach with unlabeled compounds in rats. In vivo imaging studies were performed in rodents and nonhuman primates (NHPs) with11C-labeled compounds.Results:Two selected candidates, BIO-735 and BIO-578, displayed promising attributes in vitro. After radiolabeling with tritium, [3H]BIO-735 and [3H]BIO-578 binding in rodent brain homogenates demonstrated dissociation constants of 0.6 and 2.3 nM, respectively. Binding was inhibited, concentration-dependently, by homologous compounds and thiamet G, a well-characterized and structurally diverse OGA inhibitor. Imaging studies in rats and NHPs showed both tracers had high uptake in the brain and inhibition of binding to OGA in the presence of a nonradioactive compound. However, only BIO-578 demonstrated reversible binding kinetics within the time frame of a PET study with a11C-labeled molecule to enable quantification using kinetic modeling. Specificity of tracer uptake was confirmed with a 10 mg/kg blocking dose of thiamet G.Conclusion:We describe the development and testing of 211C PET tracers targeting the protein OGA. The lead compound BIO-578 demonstrated high affinity and selectivity for OGA in rodent and human postmortem brain tissue, leading to its further testing in NHPs. NHP PET imaging studies showed that the tracer had excellent brain kinetics, with full inhibition of specific binding by thiamet G.

Kinetic modeling and long-term test-retest reproducibility of the mGluR5 PET tracer 18F-FPEB in human brain,"Gil Leurquin-Sterk, Andrey Postnov, Bart de Laat, Cindy Casteels, Sofie Celen, Cleo L Crunelle, Guy Bormans, Michel Koole, Koen Van Laere","(18)F-FPEB is a promising PET tracer for studying the metabotropic glutamate subtype 5 receptor (mGluR5) expression in neuropsychiatric disorders. To assess the potential of (18)F-FPEB for longitudinal mGluR5 evaluation in patient studies, we evaluated the long-term test-retest reproducibility using various kinetic models in the human brain. Nine healthy volunteers underwent consecutive scans separated by a 6-month period. Dynamic PET was combined with arterial sampling and radiometabolite analysis. Total distribution volume (V(T)) and nondisplaceable binding potential (BP(ND)) were derived from a two-tissue compartment model without constraints (2TCM) and with constraining the K(1)/k(2) ratio to the value of either cerebellum (2TCM-CBL) or pons (2TCM-PONS). The effect of fitting different functions to the tracer parent fractions and reducing scan duration were assessed. Regional absolute test-retest variability (aTRV), coefficient of repeatability (CR) and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) were computed. The 2TCM-CBL showed best fits. The mean 6-month aTRV of V(T) ranged from 8 to 13% (CR < 25%) with ICC > 0.6 for all kinetic models. BPND from 2TCM-CBL with a sigmoid fit for the parent fractions showed the best reproducibility, with aTRV ≤ 7% (CR < 16%) and ICC > 0.9 in most regions. Reducing the scan duration from 90 to 60 min did not affect reproducibility. These results demonstrate for the first time that (18)F-FPEB brain PET has good long-term reproducibility, therefore validating its use to monitor mGluR5 expression in longitudinal clinical studies. We suggest a 2TCM-CBL with fitting a sigmoid function to the parent fractions to be optimal for this tracer.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26799447/
A new framework for metabolic connectivity mapping using bolus [18F]FDG PET and kinetic modeling,"Tommaso Volpi, Giulia Vallini, Erica Silvestri, Mattia De Francisci, Tony Durbin, Maurizio Corbetta, John J Lee, Andrei G Vlassenko, Manu S Goyal, Alessandra Bertoldo","Metabolic connectivity (MC) has been previously proposed as the covariation of static [18F]FDG PET images across participants, i.e.,across-individualMC (ai-MC). In few cases, MC has been inferred from dynamic [18F]FDG signals, i.e.,within-individualMC (wi-MC), as for resting-state fMRI functional connectivity (FC). The validity and interpretability of both approaches is an important open issue. Here we reassess this topic, aiming to 1) develop a novel wi-MC methodology; 2) compare ai-MC maps from standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) vs. [18F]FDG kinetic parameters fully describing the tracer behavior (i.e.,Ki,K1,k3); 3) assess MC interpretability in comparison to structural connectivity and FC. We developed a new approach based on Euclidean distance to calculate wi-MC from PET time-activity curves. The across-individual correlation ofSUVR,Ki,K1,k3produced different networks depending on the chosen [18F]FDG parameter (k3MC vs.SUVRMC, r = 0.44). We found that wi-MC and ai-MC matrices are dissimilar (maximum r = 0.37), and that the match with FC is higher for wi-MC (Dice similarity: 0.47-0.63) than for ai-MC (0.24-0.39). Our analyses demonstrate that calculating individual-level MC from dynamic PET is feasible and yields interpretable matrices that bear similarity to fMRI FC measures.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37377103/
Full kinetic modeling analysis of [18F]fluorocholine Positron Emission Tomography (PET) at initial diagnosis of high-grade glioma,"Sebastià Rubí, Pedro Bibiloni, Marina Villar, Marta Brell, Manuel Valiente, Margalida Galmés, María Toscano, Gabriel Matheu, José Luis Chinchilla, Jesús Molina, José Luis Valera, Ángel Ríos, Meritxell López, Cristina Peña","Purpose: The main objective was to characterize the tracer uptake kinetics of [18F]fluoromethylcholine ([18F]F-CHO) in high-grade gliomas (HGG) through a full PET kinetic modeling approach. Secondarily, we aimed to explore the relationship between the PET uptake measures and the HGG molecular features.

Materials and methods: Twenty-four patients with a suspected diagnosis of HGG were prospectively included. They underwent a dynamic brain [18F]F-CHO-PET/CT, from which a tumoral time-activity curve was extracted. The plasma input function was obtained through arterial blood sampling with metabolite correction. These data were fitted to 1- and 2-tissue-compartment models, the best of which was selected through the Akaike information criterion. We assessed the correlation between the kinetic parameters and the conventional static PET metrics (SUVmax, SUVmeanand tumor-to-background ratio TBR). We explored the association between the [18F]F-CHO-PET quantitative parameters and relevant molecular biomarkers in HGG.

Results: Tumoral time-activity curves in all patients showed a rapid rise of [18F]F-CHO uptake followed by a plateau-like shape. Best fits were obtained with near-irreversible 2-tissue-compartment models. The perfusion-transport constant K1and the net influx rate Kishowed strong correlation with SUVmax(r = 0.808-0.861), SUVmean(r = 0.794-0.851) and TBR (r = 0.643-0.784), p < 0.002. HGG was confirmed in 21 patients, of which those with methylation of the O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) gene promoter showed higher mean Ki(p = 0.020), K1(p = 0.025) and TBR (p = 0.001) than the unmethylated ones.

Conclusion: [18F]F-CHO uptake kinetics in HGG is best explained by a 2-tissue-compartment model. The conventional static [18F]F-CHO-PET measures have been validated against the perfusion-transport constant (K1) and the net influx rate (Ki) derived from kinetic modeling. A relationship between [18F]F-CHO uptake rate and MGMT methylation is suggested but needs further confirmation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38763039/
"Tracer kinetic modeling of [(11)C]AFM, a new PET imaging agent for the serotonin transporter","Mika Naganawa, Nabeel Nabulsi, Beata Planeta, Jean-Dominique Gallezot, Shu-Fei Lin, Soheila Najafzadeh, Wendol Williams, Jim Ropchan, David Labaree, Alexander Neumeister, Yiyun Huang, Richard E Carson","[(11)C]AFM, or [(11)C]2-[2-(dimethylaminomethyl)phenylthio]-5-fluoromethylphenylamine, is a new positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand with high affinity and selectivity for the serotonin transporter (SERT). The purpose of this study was to determine the most appropriate kinetic model to quantify [(11)C]AFM binding in the healthy human brain. Positron emission tomography data and arterial input functions were acquired from 10 subjects. Compartmental modeling and the multilinear analysis-1(MA1) method were tested using the arterial input functions. The one-tissue model showed a lack of fit in low-binding regions, and the two-tissue model failed to estimate parameters reliably. Regional time-activity curves were well described by MA1. The rank order of [(11)C]AFM binding potential (BPND) matched well with the known regional SERT densities. For routine use of [(11)C]AFM, several noninvasive methods for quantification of regional binding were evaluated, including simplified reference tissue models (SRTM and SRTM2), and multilinear reference tissue models (MRTM and MRTM2). The best methods for region of interest (ROI) analysis were MA1, MRTM2, and SRTM2, with fixed population kinetic values ( or b') for the reference methods.

Tracer Kinetic Analysis of (S)-¹⁸F-THK5117 as a PET Tracer for Assessing Tau Pathology,"My Jonasson, Anders Wall, Konstantinos Chiotis, Laure Saint-Aubert, Helena Wilking, Margareta Sprycha, Beatrice Borg, Alf Thibblin, Jonas Eriksson, Jens Sörensen, Gunnar Antoni, Agneta Nordberg, Mark Lubberink","Because a correlation between tau pathology and the clinical symptoms of Alzheimer disease (AD) has been hypothesized, there is increasing interest in developing PET tracers that bind specifically to tau protein. The aim of this study was to evaluate tracer kinetic models for quantitative analysis and generation of parametric images for the novel tau ligand (S)-(18)F-THK5117.

Methods: Nine subjects (5 with AD, 4 with mild cognitive impairment) received a 90-min dynamic (S)-(18)F-THK5117 PET scan. Arterial blood was sampled for measurement of blood radioactivity and metabolite analysis. Volume-of-interest (VOI)-based analysis was performed using plasma-input models; single-tissue and 2-tissue (2TCM) compartment models and plasma-input Logan and reference tissue models; and simplified reference tissue model (SRTM), reference Logan, and SUV ratio (SUVr). Cerebellum gray matter was used as the reference region. Voxel-level analysis was performed using basis function implementations of SRTM, reference Logan, and SUVr. Regionally averaged voxel values were compared with VOI-based values from the optimal reference tissue model, and simulations were made to assess accuracy and precision. In addition to 90 min, initial 40- and 60-min data were analyzed.

Results: Plasma-input Logan distribution volume ratio (DVR)-1 values agreed well with 2TCM DVR-1 values (R(2)= 0.99, slope = 0.96). SRTM binding potential (BP(ND)) and reference Logan DVR-1 values were highly correlated with plasma-input Logan DVR-1 (R(2)= 1.00, slope ≈ 1.00) whereas SUVr(70-90)-1 values correlated less well and overestimated binding. Agreement between parametric methods and SRTM was best for reference Logan (R(2)= 0.99, slope = 1.03). SUVr(70-90)-1 values were almost 3 times higher than BP(ND) values in white matter and 1.5 times higher in gray matter. Simulations showed poorer accuracy and precision for SUVr(70-90)-1 values than for the other reference methods. SRTM BP(ND) and reference Logan DVR-1 values were not affected by a shorter scan duration of 60 min.

Conclusion: SRTM BP(ND) and reference Logan DVR-1 values were highly correlated with plasma-input Logan DVR-1 values. VOI-based data analyses indicated robust results for scan durations of 60 min. Reference Logan generated quantitative (S)-(18)F-THK5117 DVR-1 parametric images with the greatest accuracy and precision and with a much lower white-matter signal than seen with SUVr(70-90)-1 images.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26795290/

By engineering a radiotracer to target specific biologic processes of relevance to cancer (e.g., cancer metabolism, blood flow, proliferation, and tumor receptor expression or ligand binding), PET can detect cancer spread, characterize the cancer phenotype, and assess its response to treatment. For example, imaging of glucose metabolism using the radiolabeled glucose analog18F-FDG has widespread applications to all 3 of these tasks and plays an important role in cancer care. However, the current clinical practice of imaging at a single time point remote from tracer injection (i.e., static imaging) does not use all the information that PET cancer imaging can provide, especially to address questions beyond cancer detection. Reliance on tracer measures obtained only from static imaging may also lead to misleading results. In this 2-part continuing education paper, we describe the principles of tracer kinetic analysis for oncologic PET (part 1), followed by examples of specific implementations of kinetic analysis for cancer PET imaging that highlight the added benefits over static imaging (part 2). This review is designed to introduce nuclear medicine clinicians to basic concepts of kinetic analysis in oncologic imaging, with a goal of illustrating how kinetic analysis can augment our understanding of in vivo cancer biology, improve our approach to clinical decision making, and guide the interpretation of quantitative measures derived from static images.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35232879/
Structural and practical identifiability of dual-input kinetic modeling in dynamic PET of liver inflammation,"Yang Zuo, Souvik Sarkar, Michael T Corwin, Kristin Olson, Ramsey D Badawi, Guobao Wang","Dynamic18F-FDG PET with tracer kinetic modeling has the potential to noninvasively evaluate human liver inflammation using the FDG blood-to-tissue transport rate K1. Accurate kinetic modeling of dynamic liver PET data and K1quantification requires the knowledge of dual-blood input function from the hepatic artery and portal vein. While the arterial input function can be derived from the aortic region on dynamic PET images, it is difficult to extract the portal vein input function accurately from PET images. The optimization-derived dual-input kinetic modeling approach has been proposed to overcome this problem by jointly estimating the portal vein input function and FDG tracer kinetics from time activity curve fitting. In this paper, we further characterize the model properties by analyzing the structural identifiability of the model parameters using the Laplace transform and practical identifiability using computer simulation based on fourteen patient datasets. The theoretical analysis has indicated that all the kinetic parameters of the dual-input kinetic model are structurally identifiable, though subject to local solutions. The computer simulation results have shown that FDG K1can be estimated reliably in the whole-liver region of interest with reasonable bias, standard deviation, and high correlation between estimated and original values, indicating of practical identifiability of K1. The result has also demonstrated the correlation between K1and histological liver inflammation scores is reliable. FDG K1quantification by the optimization-derived dual-input kinetic model is promising for assessing liver inflammation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31051490/
Modeling PET Data Acquired During Nonsteady Conditions: What If Brain Conditions Change During the Scan?,"Evan D Morris, Gaelle M Emvalomenos, Jocelyn Hoye, Steven R Meikle","Researchers use dynamic PET imaging with target-selective tracer molecules to probe molecular processes. Kinetic models have been developed to describe these processes. The models are typically fitted to the measured PET data with the assumption that the brain is in a steady-state condition for the duration of the scan. The end results are quantitative parameters that characterize the molecular processes. The most common kinetic modeling endpoints are estimates of volume of distribution or the binding potential of a tracer. If the steady state is violated during the scanning period, the standard kinetic models may not apply. To address this issue, time-variant kinetic models have been developed for the characterization of dynamic PET data acquired while significant changes (e.g., short-lived neurotransmitter changes) are occurring in brain processes. These models are intended to extract a transient signal from data. This work in the PET field dates back at least to the 1990s. As interest has grown in imaging nonsteady events, development and refinement of time-variant models has accelerated. These new models, which we classify as belonging to the first, second, or third generation according to their innovation, have used the latest progress in mathematics, image processing, artificial intelligence, and statistics to improve the sensitivity and performance of the earliest practical time-variant models to detect and describe nonsteady phenomena. This review provides a detailed overview of the history of time-variant models in PET. It puts key advancements in the field into historical and scientific context. The sum total of the methods is an ongoing attempt to better understand the nature and implications of neurotransmitter fluctuations and other brief neurochemical phenomena.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39448268/
"Comparative assessment of linear least-squares, nonlinear least-squares, and Patlak graphical method for regional and local quantitative tracer kinetic modeling in cerebral dynamic 18 F-FDG PET","Fayçal Ben Bouallègue, Fabien Vauchot, Denis Mariano-Goulart","Purpose: Dynamic18F-FDG PET allows quantitative estimation of cerebral glucose metabolism both at the regional and local (voxel) level. Although sensitive to noise and highly computationally expensive, nonlinear least-squares (NLS) optimization stands as the reference approach for the estimation of the kinetic model parameters. Nevertheless, faster techniques, including linear least-squares (LLS) and Patlak graphical method, have been proposed to deal with high resolution noisy data, representing a more adaptable solution for routine clinical implementation. Former research investigating the relative performance of the available algorithms lack precise evaluation of kinetic parameter estimates under realistic acquisition conditions.

Methods: The present study aims at the systematic comparison of the feasibility and pertinence of kinetic modeling of dynamic cerebral18F-FDG PET using NLS, LLS, and Patlak method, based on numerical simulations and patient data. Numerical simulations were used to study the bias and variance of K1and Kiparameters estimation under representative noise levels. Patient data allowed to assess the concordance between the three methods at the regional and voxel scale, and to evaluate the robustness of the estimations with respect to patient head motion.

Results and conclusions: Our findings indicate that at the regional level NLS and LLS provide kinetic parameter estimates (K1and Ki) with similar bias and variance characteristics (K1bias ± relative standard deviation [RSD] 0.0 ± 5.1% and 0.1% ± 4.9% for NLS and LLS respectively, Kibias ± RSD 0.1% ± 4.5% and -0.7% ± 4.4% for NLS and LLS respectively). NLS estimates appear, however, to be slightly less sensitive to patient motion. At the voxel level, provided that patient motion is negligible or corrected, LLS offers an appealing alternative solution for local K1mapping. It yields K1 estimates that are highly correlated, with high correlation with NLS values (Pearson's r = 0.95 on actual data) within computations times less than two orders of magnitude lower. Last, Patlak method appears as the most robust and accurate technique for the estimation of Kivalues at the regional and voxel scale, with or without head motion. It provides low bias/low variance Kiquantification (bias ± RSD -1.5 ± 9.5% and -4.1 ± 19.7% for Patlak and NLS respectively) as well as smooth parametric images suitable for visual assessment.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30592540/
Kinetic modeling in positron emission tomography,"K C Schmidt, F E Turkheimer","Most PET kinetic modeling approaches have at their basis a compartmental model that has first-order, constant coefficients. The present article outlines the one-, two-, and three-compartment models used to measure cerebral blood flow, cerebral glucose metabolism, and receptor binding, respectively. The number of compartments of each model is based on specific knowledge of the physiological and/or biochemical compartments into which the tracer distributes. Additional physical and biochemical properties of the tracer distribution are considered in specifying the use of first-order rate constants. For example, in cerebral blood flow and receptor binding studies transport across the blood-brain barrier by diffusion can be modeled as a first-order process. A saturable carrier-mediated process or saturable enzyme catalyzed reaction, when tracer doses of the labeled substrate are used and the natural substrate is in steady-state, also results in first-order rate constants, as in glucose metabolism studies. The rate of ligand binding, on the other hand, depends on the concentrations of both substrate and available receptors. In order to appropriately model the reaction as pseudo first-order during a specified experimental interval, protocols are carefully designed to assure that the number of available binding sites remains approximately constant throughout the given interval. A broad array of scanning protocols is employed for kinetic analyses. These include single-scan approaches, which function like their autoradiographic counterparts in animal studies and are often called ""autoradiographic"" methods, which allow estimation of a single parameter. Dynamic scanning to obtain the time course of tissue activity allows simultaneous estimation of multiple parameters. Scanning may be conducted during a period of tracer uptake or after attainment of steady-state conditions. All quantitative modeling approaches share the common requirement that an arterial input function be measured or an appropriate surrogate be found. A vast array of methods is available for estimation of model parameters, both micro and macro. In the final analysis, it is the interaction among all elements of the PET study, including careful tracer selection, model specification, experimental protocol design, and sound parameter estimation methods, that determines the quantitative accuracy of the estimates of the physiological or biochemical process under study.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12072847/
Pharmacokinetic modeling of a novel hypoxia PET tracer [18F]HX4 in patients with non-small cell lung cancer,"E E Verwer, C M L Zegers, W van Elmpt, R Wierts, A D Windhorst, F M Mottaghy, P Lambin, R Boellaard","Background: [18F]HX4 is a promising new PET tracer developed to identify hypoxic areas in tumor tissue. This study analyzes [18F]HX4 kinetics and assesses the performance of simplified methods for quantification of [18F]HX4 uptake. To this end, eight patients with non-small cell lung cancer received dynamic PET scans at three different time points (0, 120, and 240 min) after injection of 426 ± 72 MBq [18F]HX4, each lasting 30 min. Several compartment models were fitted to time activity curves (TAC) derived from various areas within tumor tissue using image-derived input functions.

Results: Best fits were obtained using the reversible two-tissue compartment model with blood volume parameter (2T4k+VB). Simplified measures correlated well with VTestimates (tumor-to-blood ratio (TBr) R2= 0.96, tumor-to-muscle ratio R2= 0.94, standardized uptake value R2= 0.89).

Total-Body Dynamic Imaging and Kinetic Modeling of [18F]F-AraG in Healthy Individuals and a Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Patient Undergoing Anti-PD-1 Immunotherapy,"Negar Omidvari, Jelena Levi, Yasser G Abdelhafez, Yiran Wang, Lorenzo Nardo, Megan E Daly, Guobao Wang, Simon R Cherry","Immunotherapies, especially checkpoint inhibitors such as anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (anti-PD-1) antibodies, have transformed cancer treatment by enhancing the immune system's capability to target and kill cancer cells. However, predicting immunotherapy response remains challenging.18F-arabinosyl guanine ([18F]F-AraG) is a molecular imaging tracer targeting activated T cells, which may facilitate therapy response assessment by noninvasive quantification of immune cell activity within the tumor microenvironment and elsewhere in the body. The aim of this study was to obtain preliminary data on total-body pharmacokinetics of [18F]F-AraG as a potential quantitative biomarker for immune response evaluation.Methods:The study consisted of 90-min total-body dynamic scans of 4 healthy subjects and 1 non-small cell lung cancer patient who was scanned before and after anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. Compartmental modeling with Akaike information criterion model selection was used to analyze tracer kinetics in various organs. Additionally, 7 subregions of the primary lung tumor and 4 mediastinal lymph nodes were analyzed. Practical identifiability analysis was performed to assess the reliability of kinetic parameter estimation. Correlations of the SUVmean, the tissue-to-blood SUV ratio (SUVR), and the Logan plot slope (KLogan) with the total volume of distribution (VT) were calculated to identify potential surrogates for kinetic modeling.Results:Strong correlations were observed betweenKLoganand SUVR withVT, suggesting that they can be used as promising surrogates forVT, especially in organs with a low blood-volume fraction. Moreover, practical identifiability analysis suggested that dynamic [18F]F-AraG PET scans could potentially be shortened to 60 min, while maintaining quantification accuracy for all organs of interest. The study suggests that although [18F]F-AraG SUV images can provide insights on immune cell distribution, kinetic modeling or graphical analysis methods may be required for accurate quantification of immune response after therapy. Although SUVmeanshowed variable changes in different subregions of the tumor after therapy, the SUVR,KLogan, andVTshowed consistent increasing trends in all analyzed subregions of the tumor with high practical identifiability.Conclusion:Our findings highlight the promise of [18F]F-AraG dynamic imaging as a noninvasive biomarker for quantifying the immune response to immunotherapy in cancer patients. Promising total-body kinetic modeling results also suggest potentially wider applications of the tracer in investigating the role of T cells in the immunopathogenesis of diseases.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39089813/
Kinetic model-informed deep learning for multiplexed PET image separation,"Bolin Pan, Paul K Marsden, Andrew J Reader","Background: Multiplexed positron emission tomography (mPET) imaging can measure physiological and pathological information from different tracers simultaneously in a single scan. Separation of the multiplexed PET signals within a single PET scan is challenging due to the fact that each tracer gives rise to indistinguishable 511 keV photon pairs, and thus no unique energy information for differentiating the source of each photon pair.

Methods: Recently, many applications of deep learning for mPET image separation have been concentrated on pure data-driven methods, e.g., training a neural network to separate mPET images into single-tracer dynamic/static images. These methods use over-parameterized networks with only a very weak inductive prior. In this work, we improve the inductive prior of the deep network by incorporating a general kinetic model based on spectral analysis. The model is incorporated, along with deep networks, into an unrolled image-space version of an iterative fully 4D PET reconstruction algorithm.

Results: The performance of the proposed method was evaluated on a simulated brain image dataset for dual-tracer [F]FDG+[C]MET PET image separation. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve separation performance comparable to that obtained with single-tracer imaging. In addition, the proposed method outperformed the model-based separation methods (the conventional voxel-wise multi-tracer compartment modeling method (v-MTCM) and the image-space dual-tracer version of the fully 4D PET image reconstruction algorithm (IS-F4D)), as well as a pure data-driven separation [using a convolutional encoder-decoder (CED)], with fewer training examples.

Conclusions: This work proposes a kinetic model-informed unrolled deep learning method for mPET image separation. In simulation studies, the method proved able to outperform both the conventional v-MTCM method and a pure data-driven CED with less training data.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38951271/
Quantitative Total-Body Imaging of Blood Flow with High Temporal Resolution Early Dynamic 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose PET Kinetic Modeling,"Kevin J Chung, Abhijit J Chaudhari, Lorenzo Nardo, Terry Jones, Moon S Chen Jr, Ramsey D Badawi, Simon R Cherry, Guobao Wang","Quantitative total-body PET imaging of blood flow can be performed with freely diffusible flow radiotracers such as15O-water and11C-butanol, but their short half-lives necessitate close access to a cyclotron. Past efforts to measure blood flow with the widely available radiotracer18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) were limited to tissues with high18F-FDG extraction fraction. In this study, we developed an early-dynamic18F-FDG PET method with high temporal resolution kinetic modeling to assess total-body blood flow based on deriving the vascular transit time of18F-FDG and conducted a pilot comparison study against a11C-butanol reference.

Methods: The first two minutes of dynamic PET scans were reconstructed at high temporal resolution (60×1 s, 30×2 s) to resolve the rapid passage of the radiotracer through blood vessels. In contrast to existing methods that use blood-to-tissue transport rate () as a surrogate of blood flow, our method directly estimates blood flow using a distributed kinetic model (adiabatic approximation to the tissue homogeneity model; AATH). To validate our18F-FDG measurements of blood flow against a flow radiotracer, we analyzed total-body dynamic PET images of six human participants scanned with both18F-FDG and11C-butanol. An additional thirty-four total-body dynamic18F-FDG PET scans of healthy participants were analyzed for comparison against literature blood flow ranges. Regional blood flow was estimated across the body and total-body parametric imaging of blood flow was conducted for visual assessment. AATH and standard compartment model fitting was compared by the Akaike Information Criterion at different temporal resolutions.

Results: 18F-FDG blood flow was in quantitative agreement with flow measured from11C-butanol across same-subject regional measurements (Pearson R=0.955, p<0.001; linear regression y=0.973x-0.012), which was visually corroborated by total-body blood flow parametric imaging. Our method resolved a wide range of blood flow values across the body in broad agreement with literature ranges (e.g., healthy cohort average: 0.51±0.12 ml/min/cm3in the cerebral cortex and 2.03±0.64 ml/min/cm3in the lungs, respectively). High temporal resolution (1 to 2 s) was critical to enabling AATH modeling over standard compartment modeling.

Conclusions: Total-body blood flow imaging was feasible using early-dynamic18F-FDG PET with high-temporal resolution kinetic modeling. Combined with standard18F-FDG PET methods, this method may enable efficient single-tracer flow-metabolism imaging, with numerous research and clinical applications in oncology, cardiovascular disease, pain medicine, and neuroscience.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39252929/
Preclinical Kinetic Analysis of the Caspase-3/7 PET Tracer 18F-C-SNAT: Quantifying the Changes in Blood Flow and Tumor Retention After Chemotherapy,"Mikael Palner, Bin Shen, Jongho Jeon, Jianguo Lin, Frederick T Chin, Jianghong Rao","Early detection of tumor response to therapy is crucial to the timely identification of the most efficacious treatments. We recently developed a novel apoptosis imaging tracer, (18)F-C-SNAT (C-SNAT is caspase-sensitive nanoaggregation tracer), that undergoes an intramolecular cyclization reaction after cleavage by caspase-3/7, a biomarker of apoptosis. This caspase-3/7-dependent reaction leads to an enhanced accumulation and retention of (18)F activity in apoptotic tumors. This study aimed to fully examine in vivo pharmacokinetics of the tracer through PET imaging and kinetic modeling in a preclinical mouse model of tumor response to systemic anticancer chemotherapy.

Methods: Tumor-bearing nude mice were treated 3 times with intravenous injections of doxorubicin before undergoing a 120-min dynamic (18)F-C-SNAT PET/CT scan. Time-activity curves were extracted from the tumor and selected organs. A 2-tissue-compartment model was fitted to the time-activity curves from tumor and muscle, using the left ventricle of the heart as input function, and the pharmacokinetic rate constants were calculated.

Results: Both tumor uptake (percentage injected dose per gram) and the tumor-to-muscle activity ratio were significantly higher in the treated mice than untreated mice. Pharmacokinetic rate constants calculated by the 2-tissue-compartment model showed a significant increase in delivery and accumulation of the tracer after the systemic chemotherapeutic treatment. Delivery of (18)F-C-SNAT to the tumor tissue, quantified as K1, increased from 0.31 g⋅(mL⋅min)(-1) in untreated mice to 1.03 g⋅(mL⋅min)(-1) in treated mice, a measurement closely related to changes in blood flow. Accumulation of (18)F-C-SNAT, quantified as k3, increased from 0.03 to 0.12 min(-1), proving a higher retention of (18)F-C-SNAT in treated tumors independent from changes in blood flow. An increase in delivery was also found in the muscular tissue of treated mice without increasing accumulation.

Conclusion: (18)F-C-SNAT has significantly increased tumor uptake and significantly increased tumor-to-muscle ratio in a preclinical mouse model of tumor therapy. Furthermore, our kinetic modeling of (18)F-C-SNAT shows that chemotherapeutic treatment increased accumulation (k3) in the treated tumors, independent of increased delivery (K1).",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26045308/
Tracer kinetic modeling of the 5-HT1A receptor ligand [carbonyl-11C]WAY-100635 for PET,"R N Gunn, P A Sargent, C J Bench, E A Rabiner, S Osman, V W Pike, S P Hume, P M Grasby, A A Lammertsma","[Carbonyl-11C]WAY-100635 is a promising PET radioligand for the 5-HT1A receptor, having demonstrated more favorable characteristics for in vivo imaging than the previously available [O-methyl-11C]WAY-100635. The current study evaluates different tracer kinetic modelling strategies for the quantification of 5-HT1A receptor binding in human brain. Mathematical modelling of the carbonyl-labeled radiotracer is investigated using compartmental structures, including both plasma input and reference tissue approaches. Furthermore, the application of basis function methods allows for the investigation of parametric imaging, providing functional maps of both delivery and binding of the radioligand. Parameter estimates of binding from normal volunteers indicate a low intra- versus a high intersubject variability. It is concluded that a simplified reference tissue approach may be used to quantify 5-HT1A binding either in terms of ROI data or as parametric images.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9811559/

We performed initial brain kinetic modeling of the novel PDE10A tracer (18)F-JNJ-42259152 (2-[[4-[1-(2-(18)F-fluoroethyl)-4-(4-pyridinyl)-1H-pyrazol-3-yl]phenoxy]methyl]-3,5-dimethyl-pyridine) and studied test-retest reproducibility in healthy volunteers.

Methods: Twelve healthy volunteers (5 men, 7 women; age range, 42-77 y) were scanned dynamically up to 135 min after bolus injection of 172.5 ± 10.3 MBq of (18)F-JNJ42259152. Four volunteers (2 men, 2 women) underwent retest scanning, with a mean interscan interval of 37 d. Input functions and tracer parent fractions were determined using arterial sampling and high-performance liquid chromatography analysis. Volumes of interest for the putamen, caudate nucleus, ventral striatum, substantia nigra, thalamus, frontal cortex, and cerebellum were delineated using individual volumetric T1 MR imaging scans. One-tissue (1T) and 2-tissue (2T) models were evaluated to calculate total distribution volume (VT). Simplified models were also tested to calculate binding potential (BPND), including the simplified reference tissue model (SRTM) and multilinear reference tissue model, using the frontal cortex as the optimal reference tissue. The stability of VT and BPND was assessed down to a 60-min scan time.

Results: The average intact tracer half-life in blood was 90 min. The 2T model VT values for the putamen, caudate nucleus, ventral striatum, substantia nigra, thalamus, frontal cortex, and cerebellum were 1.54 ± 0.37, 0.90 ± 0.24, 0.64 ± 0.18, 0.42 ± 0.09, 0.35 ± 0.09, 0.30 ± 0.07, and 0.36 ± 0.12, respectively. The 1T model provided significantly lower VT values, which were well correlated to the 2T VT. SRTM BPND values referenced to the frontal cortex were 3.45 ± 0.43, 1.78 ± 0.35, 1.10 ± 0.31, and 0.44 ± 0.09 for the respective target regions putamen, caudate nucleus, ventral striatum, and substantia nigra, with similar values for the multilinear reference tissue model. Good correlations were found for the target regions putamen, caudate nucleus, ventral striatum, and substantia nigra between the 2T-compartment model BPND and the SRTM BPND (r = 0.57, 0.82, 0.70, and 0.64, respectively). SRTM BPND using a 90- and 60-min acquisition interval showed low bias. Test-retest variability was 5%-19% for 2T VT and 5%-12% for BPND SRTM.

Conclusion: Kinetic modeling of (18)F-JNJ-42259152 shows that PDE10A activity can be reliably quantified and simplified using a reference tissue model with the frontal cortex as reference and a 60-min acquisition period.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23843566/
PET-ABC: fully Bayesian likelihood-free inference for kinetic models,"Yanan Fan, Gaelle Emvalomenos, Clara Grazian, Steven R Meikle","Aims.We describe an intuitive, easy to use method called PET-ABC that enables full Bayesian statistical inference from single subject dynamic PET data. The performance of PET-ABC was compared with weighted non-linear least squares (WNLS) in terms of reliability of kinetic parameter estimation and statistical power for model selection.Methods.Dynamic PET data based on 1-tissue and 2-tissue compartmental models were simulated with 2 noise models and 3 noise levels. PET-ABC was used to evaluate the reliability of parameter estimates under each condition. It was also used to perform model selection for a simulated noisy dataset composed of a mixture of 1- and 2-tissue compartment kinetics. Finally, PET-ABC was used to analyze a non-steady state dynamic [11C] raclopride study performed on a fully conscious rat administered either 2 mg.kg-1amphetamine or saline 20 min after tracer injection.Results.PET-ABC yielded posterior point estimates for model parameters with smaller variance than WNLS, as well as probability density functions indicating confidence intervals for those estimates. It successfully identified the superiority of a 2-tissue compartment model to fit the simulated mixed model data. For the drug challenge study, the post observation probability of striatal displacement of the PET signal was 0.9 for amphetamine and approximately 0 for saline, indicating a high probability of amphetamine-induced endogenous dopamine release in the striatum. PET-ABC also demonstrated superior statistical power to WNLS (0.87 versus 0.09) for selecting the correct model in a simulated ligand displacement study.Conclusions.PET-ABC is a simple and intuitive method that provides complete Bayesian statistical analysis of single subject dynamic PET data, including the extent to which model parameter estimates and model choice are supported by the data.

Tracer kinetic modelling in MRI: estimating perfusion and capillary permeability,"S P Sourbron, D L Buckley","The tracer-kinetic models developed in the early 1990s for dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) have since become a standard in numerous applications. At the same time, the development of MRI hardware has led to increases in image quality and temporal resolution that reveal the limitations of the early models. This in turn has stimulated an interest in the development and application of a second generation of modelling approaches. They are designed to overcome these limitations and produce additional and more accurate information on tissue status. In particular, models of the second generation enable separate estimates of perfusion and capillary permeability rather than a single parameter K(trans) that represents a combination of the two. A variety of such models has been proposed in the literature, and development in the field has been constrained by a lack of transparency regarding terminology, notations and physiological assumptions. In this review, we provide an overview of these models in a manner that is both physically intuitive and mathematically rigourous. All are derived from common first principles, using concepts and notations from general tracer-kinetic theory. Explicit links to their historical origins are included to allow for a transfer of experience obtained in other fields (PET, SPECT, CT). A classification is presented that reveals the links between all models, and with the models of the first generation. Detailed formulae for all solutions are provided to facilitate implementation. Our aim is to encourage the application of these tools to DCE-MRI by offering researchers a clearer understanding of their assumptions and requirements.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22173205/
Total-Body Perfusion Imaging with [11C]-Butanol,"Elizabeth J Li, Javier E López, Benjamin A Spencer, Yasser Abdelhafez, Ramsey D Badawi, Guobao Wang, Simon R Cherry","Tissue perfusion can be affected by physiology or disease. With the advent of total-body PET, quantitative measurement of perfusion across the entire body is possible. [11C]-butanol is a perfusion tracer with a superior extraction fraction compared with [15O]-water and [13N]-ammonia. To develop the methodology for total-body perfusion imaging, a pilot study using [11C]-butanol on the uEXPLORER total-body PET/CT scanner was conducted.Methods:Eight participants (6 healthy volunteers and 2 patients with peripheral vascular disease [PVD]) were injected with a bolus of [11C]-butanol and underwent 30-min dynamic acquisitions. Three healthy volunteers underwent repeat studies at rest (baseline) to assess test-retest reproducibility; 1 volunteer underwent paired rest and cold pressor test (CPT) studies. Changes in perfusion were measured in the paired rest-CPT study. For PVD patients, local changes in perfusion were investigated and correlated with patient medical history. Regional and parametric kinetic analysis methods were developed using a 1-tissue compartment model and leading-edge delay correction.Results:Estimated baseline perfusion values ranged from 0.02 to 1.95 mL·min-1·cm-3across organs. Test-retest analysis showed that repeat baseline perfusion measurements were highly correlated (slope, 0.99; Pearsonr= 0.96,P< 0.001). For the CPT subject, the largest regional increases were in skeletal muscle (psoas, 142%) and the myocardium (64%). One of the PVD patients showed increased collateral vessel growth in the calf because of a peripheral stenosis. Comorbidities including myocardial infarction, hypothyroidism, and renal failure were correlated with variations in organ-specific perfusion.Conclusion:This pilot study demonstrates the ability to obtain reproducible measurements of total-body perfusion using [11C]-butanol. The methods are sensitive to local perturbations in flow because of physiologic stressors and disease.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37652544/
Magia: Robust Automated Image Processing and Kinetic Modeling Toolbox for PET Neuroinformatics,"Tomi Karjalainen, Jouni Tuisku, Severi Santavirta, Tatu Kantonen, Marco Bucci, Lauri Tuominen, Jussi Hirvonen, Jarmo Hietala, Juha O Rinne, Lauri Nummenmaa","Processing of positron emission tomography (PET) data typically involves manual work, causing inter-operator variance. Here we introduce the Magia toolbox that enables processing of brain PET data with minimal user intervention. We investigated the accuracy of Magia with four tracers: [11C]carfentanil, [11C]raclopride, [11C]MADAM, and [11C]PiB. We used data from 30 control subjects for each tracer. Five operators manually delineated reference regions for each subject. The data were processed using Magia using the manually and automatically generated reference regions. We first assessed inter-operator variance resulting from the manual delineation of reference regions. We then compared the differences between the manually and automatically produced reference regions and the subsequently obtained binding potentials and standardized-uptake-value-ratios. The results show that manually produced reference regions can be remarkably different from each other, leading to substantial differences also in outcome measures. While the Magia-derived reference regions were anatomically different from the manual ones, Magia produced outcome measures highly consistent with the average of the manually obtained estimates. For [11C]carfentanil and [11C]PiB there was no bias, while for [11C]raclopride and [11C]MADAM Magia produced 3-5% higher binding potentials. Based on these results and considering the high inter-operator variance of the manual method, we conclude that Magia can be reliably used to process brain PET data.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32116627/
Kinetic modeling of 18 F-PI-2620 binding in the brain using an image-derived input function with total-body PET,"Anjan Bhattarai, Emily Nicole Holy, Yiran Wang, Benjamin A Spencer, Guobao Wang, Charles DeCarli, Audrey P Fan","Accurate quantification of tau binding from18F-PI-2620 PET requires kinetic modeling and an input function. Here, we implemented a non-invasive Image-derived input function (IDIF) derived using the state-of-the-art total-body uEXPLORER PET/CT scanner to quantify tau binding and tracer delivery rate from18F-PI-2620 in the brain. Additionally, we explored the impact of scan duration on the quantification of kinetic parameters. Total-body PET dynamic data from 15 elderly participants were acquired. Time-activity curves from the grey matter regions of interest (ROIs) were fitted to the two-tissue compartmental model (2TCM) using a subject-specific IDIF derived from the descending aorta. ROI-specific kinetic parameters were estimated for different scan durations ranging from 10 to 90 minutes. Logan graphical analysis was also used to estimate the total distribution volume (VT). Differences in kinetic parameters were observed between ROIs, including significant reduction in tracer delivery rate (K1) in the medial temporal lobe. All kinetic parameters remained relatively stable after the 60-minute scan window across all ROIs, with K1showing high stability after 30 minutes of scan duration. Excellent correlation was observed between VTestimated using 2TCM and Logan plot analysis. This study demonstrated the utility of IDIF with total-body PET in investigating18F-PI-2620 kinetics in the brain.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39005369/
Design of a generic method for single dual-tracer PET imaging acquisition in clinical routine,"Nasrin Taheri, Benjamin Le Crom, Caroline Bouillot, Michel Chérel, Nicolas Costes, Sébastien Gouard, Séverine Marionneau-Lambot, Thibault Merlin, Dimitris Visvikis, Simon Stute, Thomas Carlier","Using different tracers in positron emission tomography (PET) imaging can bring complementary information on tumor heterogeneities. Ideally, PET images of different tracers should be acquired simultaneously to avoid the bias induced by movement and physiological changes between sequential acquisitions. Previous studies have demonstrated the feasibility of recovering separated PET signals or parameters of two or more tracers injected (quasi-)simultaneously in a single acquisition. In this study, a generic framework in the context of dual-tracer PET acquisition is proposed where no strong kinetic assumptions nor specific tuning of parameters are required. The performances of the framework were assessed through simulations involving the combination of [18F]FCH and [18F]FDG injections, two protocols (90 and 60 min acquisition durations) and various activity ratios between the two injections. Preclinical experiments with the same radiotracers were also conducted. Results demonstrate the ability of the method both to extract separated arterial input functions (AIF) from noisy image-derived input function and to separate the dynamic signals and further estimate kinetic parameters. The compromise between bias and variance associated with the estimation of net influx rateKishows that it is preferable to use the second injected radiotracer with twice the activity of the first for both 90 min [18F]FCH+[18F]FDG and 60 min [18F]FDG+[18F]FCH protocols. In these optimal settings, the weighted mean-squared-error of the estimated AIF was always less than 7%. TheKibias was similar to the one of single-tracer acquisitions; below 5%. Compared to single-tracer results, the variance ofKiwas twice more for 90 min dual-tracer scenario and four times more for the 60 min scenario. The generic design of the method makes it easy to use for other pairs of radiotracers and even for more than two tracers. The absence of strong kinetic assumptions and tuning parameters makes it suitable for a possible use in clinical routine.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36958048/
"Clinical Characterization of [18F]T-008, a Cholesterol 24-Hydroxylase PET Ligand: Dosimetry, Kinetic Modeling, Variability, and Soticlestat Occupancy","Cristian C Constantinescu, Terry Brown, Shining Wang, Wei Yin, Olivier Barret, Danna Jennings, Johannes Tauscher","This series of studies characterized [18F]T-008, a PET radiotracer for imaging cholesterol 24-hydroxylase (CH24H), in healthy volunteers (ClinicalTrials.gov identifierNCT02497235). Assessments included radiation dosimetry, kinetic modeling, test-retest variability (TRT) evaluation, and a dose occupancy evaluation using soticlestat, a selective CH24H inhibitor. Soticlestat is currently in phase 3 development for the treatment of seizures in Dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.Methods:In the dosimetry study, 5 participants (3 men) underwent serial whole-body scans to estimate organ-absorbed doses and effective doses of [18F]T-008 using OLINDA/EXM 1.1. For the kinetic modeling and TRT study, 6 participants (all men) underwent two 210-min dynamic [18F]T-008 PET scans with arterial blood sampling. The regional total volume of distribution was estimated using a 1-tissue-compartment model, a 2-tissue-compartment model, and Logan graphic analysis. In the dose occupancy study, 11 participants (all men) underwent 120-min scans at baseline and 2 time points (peak and trough) after receiving single oral doses of soticlestat (50-600 mg). The relationship between effect-site soticlestat concentration and brain occupancy was evaluated with a specially developed pharmacokinetic model and a saturable maximal occupancy model.Results:The estimated mean whole-body effective dose was 0.0292 mSv/MBq (SD, 0.00147 mSv/MBq). [18F]T-008 entered the brain rapidly, with a distribution consistent with known CH24H distribution densities. The 2-tissue-compartment model and Logan graphic analysis best described the tracer kinetics. The mean TRT for estimating total volume of distribution was 7%-15%. Single doses of soticlestat in the range 50-600 mg resulted in occupancies of 64%-96% at 2 h and 11%-79% at 24 h. The estimated half-maximal effect-site concentration of soticlestat was 5.52 ng/mL.Conclusion:[18F]T-008 is a suitable PET radiotracer for quantitatively analyzing CH24H in the human brain. Using [18F]T-008 and PET, we demonstrated that soticlestat was brain-penetrant and established target engagement by displacing [18F]T-008 in a dose-dependent manner in the brain.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37770111/
Total-body Dynamic Imaging and Kinetic Modeling of 18F-AraG in Healthy Individuals and a Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Patient Undergoing Anti-PD-1 Immunotherapy,"Negar Omidvari, Jelena Levi, Yasser G Abdelhafez, Yiran Wang, Lorenzo Nardo, Megan E Daly, Guobao Wang, Simon R Cherry","Immunotherapies, especially the checkpoint inhibitors such as anti-PD-1 antibodies, have transformed cancer treatment by enhancing immune system's capability to target and kill cancer cells. However, predicting immunotherapy response remains challenging.18F-AraG is a molecular imaging tracer targeting activated T cells, which may facilitate therapy response assessment by non-invasive quantification of immune cell activity within tumor microenvironment and elsewhere in the body. The aim of this study was to obtain preliminary data on total-body pharmacokinetics of18F-AraG, as a potential quantitative biomarker for immune response evaluation.

Methods: The study consisted of 90-min total-body dynamic scans of four healthy subjects and one non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patient, scanned before and after anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. Compartmental modeling with Akaike information criterion model selection were employed to analyze tracer kinetics in various organs. Additionally, seven sub-regions of the primary lung tumor and four mediastinal lymph nodes were analyzed. Practical identifiability analysis was performed to assess reliability of kinetic parameter estimation. Correlations of SUVmean, SUVR (tissue-to-blood ratio), and Logan plot slopewith total volume-of-distributionwere calculated to identify potential surrogates for kinetic modeling.

Results: Strong correlations were observed betweenand SUVR values with, suggesting that they can be used as promising surrogates for, especially in organs with low blood-volume fraction. Moreover, the practical identifiability analysis suggests that the dynamic18F-AraG PET scans could potentially be shortened to 60 minutes, while maintaining quantification accuracy for all organs-of-interest. The study suggests that although18F-AraG SUV images can provide insights on immune cell distribution, kinetic modeling or graphical analysis methods may be required for accurate quantification of immune response post-therapy. While SUVmean showed variable changes in different sub-regions of the tumor post-therapy, the SUVR,, andshowed consistent increasing trends in all analyzed sub-regions of the tumor with high practical identifiability.

Conclusion: Our findings highlight the promise of18F-AraG dynamic imaging as a non-invasive biomarker for quantifying the immune response to immunotherapy in cancer patients. The promising total-body kinetic modeling results also suggest potentially wider applications of the tracer in investigating the role of T cells in the immunopathogenesis of diseases.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37790461/
"Kinetic Modeling and Test-Retest Reproducibility of 11C-EKAP and 11C-FEKAP, Novel Agonist Radiotracers for PET Imaging of the κ-Opioid Receptor in Humans","Mika Naganawa, Songye Li, Nabeel Nabulsi, Shu-Fei Lin, David Labaree, Jim Ropchan, Hong Gao, Michael Mei, Shannan Henry, David Matuskey, Richard E Carson, Yiyun Huang","The κ-opioid receptor (KOR) is implicated in various neuropsychiatric disorders. We previously evaluated an agonist tracer,11C-GR103545, for PET imaging of KOR in humans. Although11C-GR103545 showed high brain uptake, good binding specificity, and selectivity for KOR, it displayed slow kinetics and relatively large test-retest variability of total distribution volume (VT) estimates (15%). Therefore, we set out to develop 2 novel KOR agonist radiotracers,11C-EKAP and11C-FEKAP. In nonhuman primates, both tracers exhibited faster kinetics than11C-GR103545 and comparable binding parameters to11C-GR103545. The aim of this study was to assess their kinetic and binding properties in humans.Methods:Six healthy subjects underwent 120-min test-retest PET scans with both11C-EKAP and11C-FEKAP. Metabolite-corrected arterial input functions were measured. Regional time-activity curves were generated for 14 regions of interest. One-tissue-compartment and 2-tissue-compartment (2TC) models and the multilinear analysis-1 (MA1) method were applied to the regional time-activity curves to calculateVTThe time stability ofVTand test-retest reproducibility were evaluated. Levels of specific binding, as measured by the nondisplaceable binding potential (BPND) for the 3 tracers (11C-EKAP,11C-FEKAP, and11C-GR103545), were compared using a graphical method.Results:For both tracers, regional time-activity curves were fitted well with the 2TC model and MA1 method (t* = 20 min) but not with the 1-tissue-compartment model. Given the unreliably estimated parameters in several fits with the 2TC model and a goodVTmatch between MA1 and 2TC, MA1 was chosen as the appropriate model for both tracers. Mean MA1VTwas highest for11C-GR103545, followed by11C-EKAP and then11C-FEKAP. The minimum scan time for stableVTmeasurement was 90 and 110 min for11C-EKAP and11C-FEKAP, respectively, compared with 140 min for11C-GR103545. The mean absolute test-retest variability in MA1VTestimates was 7% and 18% for11C-EKAP and11C-FEKAP, respectively.BPNDlevels were similar for11C-FEKAP and11C-GR103545 but were about 25% lower for11C-EKAP.Conclusion:The 2 novel KOR agonist tracers showed faster tissue kinetics than11C-GR103545. Even with a slightly lowerBPND,11C-EKAP is judged to be a better tracer for imaging and quantification of KOR in humans, on the basis of the shorter minimum scan time and the excellent test-retest reproducibility of regionalVT.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32169917/
Development of a 4D Digital Phantom for Tracer Kinetic Modeling and Analysis of Dynamic Perfusion PET and SPECT Simulation Studies,"George S K Fung, Takahiro Higuchi, Min Jae Park, W Paul Segars, Benjamin M W Tsui","The goal is to develop a 4D digital perfusion cardiac-torso (PCAT) phantom, a tracer kinetic extension of the XCAT phantom, by modeling the time activity curves (TACs) of individual organ regions in the phantom for dynamic perfusion PET and SPECT simulation studies. The PCAT phantom is based on a generalized compartmental model, which accepts the blood input function, multiple series or parallel compartments, the bidirectional rate constants between the compartments, the blood volume in the tissue, the extraction curves, and other properties of a specific tracer. Based on the kinetic differential equations of the compartmental model, the TACs of the targeted organ regions were determined. For a specific time point, a voxelized anatomical realistic phantom, which with or without the cardiac and respiratory motions, was generated and the activity concentrations in the organ regions were assigned according to the corresponding TACs. According to the dynamic scanning protocol, multiple phantoms at different acquisition time points, which could have uniform or non-uniform time intervals, were generated. When combining the dynamic phantoms with realistic projection simulator, realistic dynamic projection data could be generated by easily adopting to various scanning protocols and imaging systems. With the availability of the ""known truth"", the activity map of the targeted organ regions, the TACs, the estimated rate constants and other kinetic parameters, from the projection data and the reconstructed images could be quantitatively evaluated. We demonstrate the usefulness of the 4D PCAT phantom in initial simulation studies in dynamic myocardial perfusion PET imaging with different tracers. The PCAT phantom was found to be an important bridge between the creation of TACs and the generation of simulated projection data. It is a useful simulation tool to study different kinetic analysis methods, acquisition protocols, reconstruction methods, and imaging parameter settings.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26536594/
Multiparametric Cardiac 18F-FDG PET in Humans: Kinetic Model Selection and Identifiability Analysis,"Yang Zuo, Ramsey D Badawi, Cameron C Foster, Thomas Smith, Javier E López, Guobao Wang","Cardiac18F-FDG PET has been used in clinics to assess myocardial glucose metabolism. Its ability for imaging myocardial glucose transport, however, has rarely been exploited in clinics. Using the dynamic FDG-PET scans of ten patients with coronary artery disease, we investigate in this paper appropriate dynamic scan and kinetic modeling protocols for efficient quantification of myocardial glucose transport. Three kinetic models and the effect of scan duration were evaluated by using statistical fit quality, assessing the impact on kinetic quantification, and analyzing the practical identifiability. The results show that the kinetic model selection depends on the scan duration. The reversible two-tissue model was needed for a one-hour dynamic scan. The irreversible two-tissue model was optimal for a scan duration of around 10-15 minutes. If the scan duration was shortened to 2-3 minutes, a one-tissue model was the most appropriate. For global quantification of myocardial glucose transport, we demonstrated that an early dynamic scan with a duration of 10-15 minutes and irreversible kinetic modeling was comparable to the full one-hour scan with reversible kinetic modeling. Myocardial glucose transport quantification provides an additional physiological parameter on top of the existing assessment of glucose metabolism and has the potential to enable single tracer multiparametric imaging in the myocardium.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33778234/
High-Temporal-Resolution Kinetic Modeling of Lung Tumors with Dual-Blood Input Function Using Total-Body Dynamic PET,"Yiran Wang, Yasser G Abdelhafez, Benjamin A Spencer, Rashmi Verma, Mamta Parikh, Nicholas Stollenwerk, Lorenzo Nardo, Terry Jones, Ramsey D Badawi, Simon R Cherry, Guobao Wang","The lungs are supplied by both the pulmonary arteries carrying deoxygenated blood originating from the right ventricle and the bronchial arteries carrying oxygenated blood downstream from the left ventricle. However, this effect of dual blood supply has never been investigated using PET, partially because the temporal resolution of conventional dynamic PET scans is limited. The advent of PET scanners with a long axial field of view, such as the uEXPLORER total-body PET/CT system, permits dynamic imaging with high temporal resolution (HTR). In this work, we modeled the dual-blood input function (DBIF) and studied its impact on the kinetic quantification of normal lung tissue and lung tumors using HTR dynamic PET imaging.Methods:Thirteen healthy subjects and 6 cancer subjects with lung tumors underwent a dynamic18F-FDG scan with the uEXPLORER for 1 h. Data were reconstructed into dynamic frames of 1 s in the early phase. Regional time-activity curves of lung tissue and tumors were analyzed using a 2-tissue compartmental model with 3 different input functions: the right ventricle input function, left ventricle input function, and proposed DBIF, all with time delay and dispersion corrections. These models were compared for time-activity curve fitting quality using the corrected Akaike information criterion and for differentiating lung tumors from lung tissue using the Mann-WhitneyUtest. Voxelwise multiparametric images by the DBIF model were further generated to verify the regional kinetic analysis.Results:The effect of dual blood supply was pronounced in the high-temporal-resolution time-activity curves of lung tumors. The DBIF model achieved better time-activity curve fitting than the other 2 single-input models according to the corrected Akaike information criterion. The estimated fraction of left ventricle input was low in normal lung tissue of healthy subjects but much higher in lung tumors (∼0.04 vs. ∼0.3,P< 0.0003). The DBIF model also showed better robustness in the difference in18F-FDG net influx rate [Formula: see text] and delivery rate [Formula: see text] between lung tumors and normal lung tissue. Multiparametric imaging with the DBIF model further confirmed the differences in tracer kinetics between normal lung tissue and lung tumors.Conclusion:The effect of dual blood supply in the lungs was demonstrated using HTR dynamic imaging and compartmental modeling with the proposed DBIF model. The effect was small in lung tissue but nonnegligible in lung tumors. HTR dynamic imaging with total-body PET can offer a sensitive tool for investigating lung diseases.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38548347/

In this study, we validate a simplified blood-free methodologic framework forestimation by fitting the early phase tracer dynamics using a single irreversible compartment model and an image-derived input function (1T1K-IDIF).

Methods: The method is tested on a multi-site dataset containing 177PETstudies from twoTSPOtracers ([11C]PBR28 and [18F]DPA714). Firstly,estimates were compared in terms of both bias and correlation with standard kinetic methodology. Then, the method was tested on an independent sample of [11C]PBR28 scans before and after inflammatory interferon-αchallenge, and on test-retest dataset of [18F]DPA714 scans.

Results: Comparison with standard kinetic methodology showed good-to-excellent intra-subject correlation for regional(= 0.93 ± 0.08), although the bias was variable depending onIDIFability to approximate blood input functions (0.03-0.39 mL/cm3/min).unveiled a significant reduction ofBBBpermeability after inflammatory interferon-αchallenge, replicating results from standard quantification.

Kinetic modelling in small animal imaging with PET,"Patrick Dupont, James Warwick","Small animal imaging with positron emission tomography has undergone a major evolution. This has been driven by technical improvements and the development of dedicated PET camera's for small animals. The focus has shifted from detection of tracer uptake and visualization of the tracer distribution towards the quantification of the physiological parameters necessary to use this technique for kinetic modelling of tracers. At the moment there are still several issues which need further research and evaluation before we can fully employ the possibilities of PET as an in-vivo measurement of underlying molecular biology. These issues relate to improved quantification of measurements, improved image reconstruction and processing, and the use of blood plasma data in combination with kinetic models. Besides the more technical issues, there are two more issues which need further clarification: the effect of the anaesthesia, and the effect of radiation on the experiment itself. In this review, we will give an overview of how the technique can be used but we will also discuss the issues mentioned above.

Non-invasive kinetic modelling approaches for quantitative analysis of brain PET studies,"Chris W J van der Weijden, Pascalle Mossel, Anna L Bartels, Rudi A J O Dierckx, Gert Luurtsema, Adriaan A Lammertsma, Antoon T M Willemsen, Erik F J de Vries","Pharmacokinetic modelling with arterial sampling is the gold standard for analysing dynamic PET data of the brain. However, the invasive character of arterial sampling prevents its widespread clinical application. Several methods have been developed to avoid arterial sampling, in particular reference region methods. Unfortunately, for some tracers or diseases, no suitable reference region can be defined. For these cases, other potentially non-invasive approaches have been proposed: (1) a population based input function (PBIF), (2) an image derived input function (IDIF), or (3) simultaneous estimation of the input function (SIME). This systematic review aims to assess the correspondence of these non-invasive methods with the gold standard. Studies comparing non-invasive pharmacokinetic modelling methods with the current gold standard methods using an input function derived from arterial blood samples were retrieved from PubMed/MEDLINE (until December 2021). Correlation measurements were extracted from the studies. The search yielded 30 studies that correlated outcome parameters (VT, DVR, or BPNDfor reversible tracers; Kior CMRglufor irreversible tracers) from a potentially non-invasive method with those obtained from modelling using an arterial input function. Some studies provided similar results for PBIF, IDIF, and SIME-based methods as for modelling with an arterial input function (R2= 0.59-1.00, R2= 0.71-1.00, R2= 0.56-0.96, respectively), if the non-invasive input curve was calibrated with arterial blood samples. Even when the non-invasive input curve was calibrated with venous blood samples or when no calibration was applied, moderate to good correlations were reported, especially for the IDIF and SIME (R2= 0.71-1.00 and R2= 0.36-0.96, respectively). Overall, this systematic review illustrates that non-invasive methods to generate an input function are still in their infancy. Yet, IDIF and SIME performed well, not only with arterial blood calibration, but also with venous or no blood calibration, especially for some tracers without plasma metabolites, which would potentially make these methods better suited for clinical application. However, these methods should still be properly validated for each individual tracer and application before implementation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36651951/
Dynamic dual-tracer PET reconstruction,"Fei Gao, Huafeng Liu, Yiqiang Jian, Pengcheng Shi","Although of important medical implications, simultaneous dual-tracer positron emission tomography reconstruction remains a challenging problem, primarily because the photon measurements from dual tracers are overlapped. In this paper, we propose a simultaneous dynamic dual-tracer reconstruction of tissue activity maps based on guidance from tracer kinetics. The dual-tracer reconstruction problem is formulated in a state-space representation, where parallel compartment models serve as continuous-time system equation describing the tracer kinetic processes of dual tracers, and the imaging data is expressed as discrete sampling of the system states in measurement equation. The image reconstruction problem has therefore become a state estimation problem in a continuous-discrete hybrid paradigm, and H infinity filtering is adopted as the estimation strategy. As H infinity filtering makes no assumptions on the system and measurement statistics, robust reconstruction results can be obtained for the dual-tracer PET imaging system where the statistical properties of measurement data and system uncertainty are not available a priori, even when there are disturbances in the kinetic parameters. Experimental results on digital phantoms, Monte Carlo simulations and physical phantoms have demonstrated the superior performance.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19694251/
"Evaluation of quantitative modeling methods in whole-body, dynamic [11C]-erlotinib PET","Joseph Ryan Petrulli, Mingqiang Zheng, Yiyun Huang, Nabeel B Nabulsi, Sarah B Goldberg, Joseph N Contessa, Evan D Morris","Background: [11C]-Erlotinib is a radiolabeled analogue of a tyrosine kinase inhibitor used to treat non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) which expresses specific kinase domain mutations of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). In this study, 10 subjects with NSCLC and assorted EGFR mutation status underwent a dynamic, multi-bed positron emission tomography (PET) scan using [11C]-erlotinib. Data were analyzed using a variety of quantitative techniques common in PET (graphical methods, kinetic models, and uptake value-based endpoints). Our primary goal was to determine the most reliable imaging endpoint given the need for maintaining minimal patient burden and recognizing the advantage of simple calculations in future trials.

Results: Standard uptake values (a semi-quantitative endpoint) were well correlated with both binding potential and volume of distribution (fully quantitative endpoints). Normalized tracer uptake was found to stabilize approximately 60 minutes post tracer injection.Conclusions: The kinetic properties of [11C]-erlotinib varied greatly across subjects. Our novel scanning protocol produced an important dataset which highlights the great heterogeneity of NSCLC and its apparent impact on [11C]-erlotinib kinetics. A lack of correlation between EGFR mutational status and quantitative endpoints appears to be due to disease heterogeneity and low tracer uptake. The most reliable fits of the dynamic data were based on the one-tissue compartmental model which were well correlated with mean SUV. Due to this correlation and good stability at late-time, SUV seems sufficiently well-suited to quantitative imaging of NSCLC lesions in the whole body with [11C]-erlotinib.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34079641/
"Kinetic modeling of (11)C-LY2795050, a novel antagonist radiotracer for PET imaging of the kappa opioid receptor in humans","Mika Naganawa, Ming-Qiang Zheng, Nabeel Nabulsi, Giampaolo Tomasi, Shannan Henry, Shu-Fei Lin, Jim Ropchan, David Labaree, Johannes Tauscher, Alexander Neumeister, Richard E Carson, Yiyun Huang","(11)C-LY2795050 is a novel kappa opioid receptor (KOR) antagonist tracer for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. The purpose of this first-in-human study was to determine the optimal kinetic model for analysis of (11)C-LY2795050 imaging data. Sixteen subjects underwent baseline scans and blocking scans after oral naltrexone. Compartmental modeling and multilinear analysis-1 (MA1) were applied using the arterial input functions. Two-tissue compartment model and MA1 were found to be the best models to provide reliable measures of binding parameters. The rank order of (11)C-LY2795050 distribution volume (VT) matched the known regional KOR densities in the human brain. Blocking scans with naltrexone indicated no ideal reference region for (11)C-LY2795050. Three methods for calculation of the nondisplaceable distribution volume (VND) were assessed: (1) individual VND estimated from naltrexone occupancy plots, (2) mean VND across subjects, and (3) a fixed fraction of cerebellum VT. Approach (3) produced the lowest intersubject variability in the calculation of binding potentials (BPND, BPF, and BPP). Therefore, binding potentials of (11)C-LY2795050 can be determined if the specific binding fraction in the cerebellum is presumed to be unchanged by diseases and experimental conditions. In conclusion, results from the present study show the suitability of (11)C-LY2795050 to image and quantify KOR in humans.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25182664/
Evaluation of tracer kinetic models for quantification of P-glycoprotein function using (R)-[11C]verapamil and PET,"Mark Lubberink, Gert Luurtsema, Bart N M van Berckel, Ronald Boellaard, Rolf Toornvliet, Albert D Windhorst, Eric J F Franssen, Adriaan A Lammertsma","Diminished P-glycoprotein (P-gp)-mediated transport across the blood-brain barrier may play an important role in several neurodegenerative disorders. In previous studies, a racemic mixture of (R)-[(11)C]verapamil and (S)-[(11)C]verapamil has been used as tracer for assessing P-gp function using positron emission tomography (PET). Quantification, however, is compromised by potential differences in kinetics between these two isomers. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the kinetics of pure (R)-[(11)C]verapamil in humans and to develop a tracer kinetic model for the analysis of P-gp-mediated transport of (R)-[(11)C]verapamil, including the putative contribution of its radioactive metabolites. Dynamic (R)-[(11)C]verapamil PET scans of 10 male volunteers were analysed with various single- or two-tissue compartment models, with separate compartments for N-dealkylated and N-demethylated metabolites, assuming that either (R)-[(11)C]verapamil alone or (R)-[(11)C]verapamil and any combination of metabolites cross the BBB. In addition, six of the subjects underwent two (R)-[(11)C]verapamil scans to evaluate test-retest reliability. One hour after injection, 50% of total plasma radioactivity consisted of labelled metabolites. Most models fitted the data well and the analysis did not point to a definite 'best' model, with differences in optimal model between subjects. The lowest mean test-retest variability (2.9%) was found for a single-tissue model without any metabolite correction. Models with separate metabolite compartments lead to high test-retest variability. Assuming that differences in kinetics of (R)-[(11)C]verapamil and N-dealkylated metabolites are small, a one input, one-tissue model with correction for N-demethylated metabolites only leads to a good compromise between fit quality and test-retest variability.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16757979/
Modeling venous plasma samples in [18F] FDG PET studies: a nonlinear mixed-effects approach,"Tommaso Volpi, John J Lee, Erica Silvestri, Tony Durbin, Maurizio Corbetta, Manu S Goyal, Andrei G Vlassenko, Alessandra Bertoldo","The gold-standard approach to quantifying dynamic PET images relies on using invasive measures of the arterial plasma tracer concentration. An attractive alternative is to employ an image-derived input function (IDIF), corrected for spillover effects and rescaled with venous plasma samples. However, venous samples are not always available for every participant. In this work, we used the nonlinear mixed-effects modeling approach to develop a model which infers venous tracer kinetics by using venous samples obtained from a population of healthy individuals and integrating subject-specific covariates. Population parameters (fixed effects), their between-subject variability (random effects), and the effects of covariates were estimated. The selected model will allow to reliably infer venous tracer kinetics in subjects with missing measurements. Clinical relevance - The derived model will be relevant for fully noninvasive dynamic FDG PET quantification using image-derived input functions in both healthy and patient populations when hemodynamics is not impaired.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36086500/
"Kinetic Modeling of 18F-(2 S, 4 R)4-Fluoroglutamine in Mouse Models of Breast Cancer to Estimate Glutamine Pool Size as an Indicator of Tumor Glutamine Metabolism","Varsha Viswanath, Rong Zhou, Hsiaoju Lee, Shihong Li, Abigail Cragin, Robert K Doot, David A Mankoff, Austin R Pantel","The PET radiotracer18F-(2S,4R)4-fluoroglutamine (18F-Gln) reflects glutamine transport and can be used to infer glutamine metabolism. Mouse xenograft studies have demonstrated that18F-Gln uptake correlates directly with glutamine pool size and is inversely related to glutamine metabolism through the glutaminase enzyme. To provide a framework for the analysis of18F-Gln-PET, we have examined18F-Gln uptake kinetics in mouse models of breast cancer at baseline and after inhibition of glutaminase. We describe results of the preclinical analysis and computer simulations with the goal of model validation and performance assessment in anticipation of human breast cancer patient studies.Methods:Triple-negative breast cancer and receptor-positive xenografts were implanted in athymic mice. PET mouse imaging was performed at baseline and after treatment with a glutaminase inhibitor or a vehicle solution for 4 mouse groups. Dynamic PET images were obtained for 1 h beginning at the time of intravenous injection of18F-Gln. Kinetic analysis and computer simulations were performed on representative time-activity curves, testing 1- and 2-compartment models to describe kinetics.Results:Dynamic imaging for 1 h captured blood and tumor time-activity curves indicative of largely reversible uptake of18F-Gln in tumors. Consistent with this observation, a 2-compartment model indicated a relatively low estimate of the rate constant of tracer trapping, suggesting that the 1-compartment model is preferable. Logan plot graphical analysis demonstrated late linearity, supporting reversible kinetics and modeling with a single compartment. Analysis of the mouse data and simulations suggests that estimates of glutamine pool size, specifically the distribution volume (VD) for18F-Gln, were more reliable using the 1-compartment reversible model than the 2-compartment irreversible model. Tumor-to-blood ratios, a more practical potential proxy of VD, correlated well with volume of distribution from single-compartment models and Logan analyses.Conclusion:Kinetic analysis of dynamic18F-Gln-PET images demonstrated the ability to measure VDto estimate glutamine pool size, a key indicator of cellular glutamine metabolism, by both a 1-compartment model and Logan analysis. Changes in VDwith glutaminase inhibition support the ability to assess response to glutamine metabolism-targeted therapy.

Kinetic analysis of the cannabinoid-1 receptor PET tracer [(18)F]MK-9470 in human brain,"Sandra Marina Sanabria-Bohórquez, Terence G Hamill, Karolien Goffin, Inge De Lepeleire, Guy Bormans, H Donald Burns, Koen Van Laere","Purpose: Quantitative imaging of the type 1 cannabinoid receptor (CB1R) opens perspectives for many neurological and psychiatric disorders. We characterized the kinetics and reproducibility of the CB1R tracer [(18)F]MK-9470 in human brain.

Methods: [(18)F]MK-9470 data were analysed using reversible models and the distribution volume V (T) and V (ND) k (3) (V (ND) k (3) = K (1) k (2)) were estimated. Tracer binding was also evaluated using irreversible kinetics and the irreversible uptake constant K (i) and fractional uptake rate (FUR) were estimated. The effect of blood flow on these parameters was evaluated. Additionally, the possibility of determining the tracer plasma kinetics using a reduced number of blood samples was also examined.

Results: A reversible two-tissue compartment model using a global k (4) value was necessary to describe brain kinetics. Both V (T) and V (ND) k (3) were estimated satisfactorily and their test-retest variability was between 10% and 30%. Irreversible methods adequately described brain kinetics and FUR values were equivalent to K (i). The linear relationship between K (i) and V (ND) k (3) demonstrated that K (i) or FUR and thus the simple measure of tracer brain uptake provide CB1R availability information. The test-retest variability of K (i) and FUR was <10% and estimates were independent of blood flow. Brain uptake can be used as a receptor availability index, albeit at the expense of potential bias due to between-subject differences in tracer plasma kinetics.

Conclusion: [(18)F]MK-9470 specific binding can be accurately determined using FUR values requiring a short scan 90 to 120 min after tracer administration. Our results suggest that [(18)F]MK-9470 plasma kinetics can be assessed using a few venous samples.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20033684/

Our method uses high-temporal resolution dynamic imaging and kinetic modeling to jointly estimate cerebral blood flow and tracer-specific BBB transport rate from a single dynamic PET scan and measure the molecular permeability-surface area (PS) product of the radiotracer. We show our method can resolve BBB PS across three PET radiotracers with greatly differing permeabilities, measure reductions in BBB PS of18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) in healthy aging, and demonstrate a possible brain-body association between decreased FDG BBB PS in patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver inflammation.

Tracer kinetic modeling of 11C-acetate applied in the liver with positron emission tomography,"Sirong Chen, Chilai Ho, Dagan Feng, Zheru Chi","It is well known that 40%-50% of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) do not show increased 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake. Recent research studies have demonstrated that 11C-acetate may be a complementary tracer to FDG in positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of HCC in the liver. Quantitative dynamic modeling is, therefore, conducted to evaluate the kinetic characteristics of this tracer in HCC and nontumor liver tissue. A three-compartment model consisting of four parameters with dual inputs is proposed and compared with that of five parameters. Twelve regions of dynamic datasets of the liver extracted from six patients are used to test the models. Estimation of the adequacy of these models is based on Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) and Schwarz Criteria (SC) by statistical study. The forward clearance K = K1 * k3/(k2 + k3) is estimated and defined as a new parameter called the local hepatic metabolic rate-constant of acetate (LHMRAct) using both the weighted nonlinear least squares (NLS) and the linear Patlak methods. Preliminary results show that the LHMRAct of the HCC is significantly higher than that of the nontumor liver tissue. These model parameters provide quantitative evidence and understanding on the kinetic basis of C-acetate for its potential role in the imaging of HCC using PET.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15084068/
Direct estimation of kinetic parametric images for dynamic PET,"Guobao Wang, Jinyi Qi","Dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) can monitor spatiotemporal distribution of radiotracer in vivo. The spatiotemporal information can be used to estimate parametric images of radiotracer kinetics that are of physiological and biochemical interests. Direct estimation of parametric images from raw projection data allows accurate noise modeling and has been shown to offer better image quality than conventional indirect methods, which reconstruct a sequence of PET images first and then perform tracer kinetic modeling pixel-by-pixel. Direct reconstruction of parametric images has gained increasing interests with the advances in computing hardware. Many direct reconstruction algorithms have been developed for different kinetic models.

Advances and challenges in immunoPET methodology,"Philipp Mohr, Joyce van Sluis, Marjolijn N Lub-de Hooge, Adriaan A Lammertsma, Adrienne H Brouwers, Charalampos Tsoumpas","Immuno-positron emission tomography (immunoPET) enables imaging of specific targets that play a role in targeted therapy and immunotherapy, such as antigens on cell membranes, targets in the disease microenvironment, or immune cells. The most common immunoPET applications use a monoclonal antibody labeled with a relatively long-lived positron emitter such as89Zr (T1/2= 78.4 h), but smaller antibody-based constructs labeled with various other positron emitting radionuclides are also being investigated. This molecular imaging technique can thus guide the development of new drugs and may have a pivotal role in selecting patients for a particular therapy. In early phase immunoPET trials, multiple imaging time points are used to examine the time-dependent biodistribution and to determine the optimal imaging time point, which may be several days after tracer injection due to the slow kinetics of larger molecules. Once this has been established, usually only one static scan is performed and semi-quantitative values are reported. However, total PET uptake of a tracer is the sum of specific and nonspecific uptake. In addition, uptake may be affected by other factors such as perfusion, pre-/co-administration of the unlabeled molecule, and the treatment schedule. This article reviews imaging methodologies used in immunoPET studies and is divided into two parts. The first part summarizes the vast majority of clinical immunoPET studies applying semi-quantitative methodologies. The second part focuses on a handful of studies applying pharmacokinetic models and includes preclinical and simulation studies. Finally, the potential and challenges of immunoPET quantification methodologies are discussed within the context of the recent technological advancements provided by long axial field of view PET/CT scanners.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39355220/
Low activity [11C]raclopride kinetic modeling in the mouse brain using the spatiotemporal kernel method,"Alan Miranda, Daniele Bertoglio, Sigrid Stroobants, Steven Staelens, Jeroen Verhaeghe","Depending on the molar activity of the tracer, the maximal allowable injected activity in mouse brain PET studies can be extremely low in order to avoid receptor saturation. Therefore, a high level of noise can be present in the image. We investigate several dynamic PET reconstruction methods in reduced counts, or equivalently in reduced injected activity, data exemplified in [11C]racloprideBPNDandR1quantification using the simplified reference tissue model (SRTM). We compared independent frame reconstruction (IFR), post-reconstruction HYPR denoising (IFR + HYPR), direct reconstruction using the SRTM model (DIR-SRTM), and the spatial (KERS) and spatiotemporal kernel reconstruction (KERST). Additionally, HYPR denoising of the frames used as features for the calculation of the spatial kernel matrix, was investigated (KERS-HYPR and KERST-HYPR).In vivodata of 11 mice, was used to generate list-mode data for five reduced count levels corresponding to reductions by a factor 4, 8, 12, 16 and 32 (equivalently 2.07, 1.04, 0.691, 0.518, and 0.260 MBq). Correlation of regionalBPNDandR1values (reduced versus full counts reconstructions) was high (r > 0.94) for all methods, with KERS-HYPR and KERST-HYPR reaching the highest correlation (r> 0.96). Among methods with regularization, DIR-SRTM showed the largest variability inBPND(Bland-Altman SD from 3.0% to 12%), while IFR showed it forR1(5.1%-14.6%). KERST and KERST-HYPR were the only methods with Bland-Altman bias and SD below 5% for noise level up to a reduction factor of 16. At the voxel level,BPNDandR1correlation was gradually decreased with increasing noise, with the largest correlation (BPNDr> 0.88,R1r> 0.62) for KERS-HYPR and KERST-HYPR. The spatial and the spatiotemporal kernel methods performed similarly, while using only temporal regularization with direct reconstruction showed more variability. AlthoughR1 values present noise, using the spatiotemporal kernel reconstruction, accurate estimates of binding potential could be obtained with mouse injected activities as low as 0.26-0.518 MBq. This is desirable in order to maintain the tracer kinetics principle in mouse studies.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33906176/
Modeling dynamic PET-SPECT studies in the wavelet domain,"F E Turkheimer, R B Banati, D Visvikis, J A Aston, R N Gunn, V J Cunningham","This work develops a theoretical framework and corresponding algorithms for the modeling of dynamic PET-SPECT studies both in time and space. The problem of estimating the spatial dimension is solved by applying the wavelet transform to each scan of the dynamic sequence and then performing the kinetic modeling and statistical analysis in the wavelet domain. On reconstruction through the inverse wavelet transform, one obtains parametric images that are consistent estimates of the spatial patterns of the kinetic parameter of interest. The theoretical setup allows the use of linear techniques currently used in PET-SPECT for kinetic analysis. The method is applied to artificial and real data sets. The application to dynamic PET-SPECT studies was performed both for validation purposes, when the spatial patterns are known, and for illustration of the advantages offered by the technique in case of tracers with an unknown pattern of distribution.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10826539/
Rapid Multi-Tracer PET Tumor Imaging With F-FDG and Secondary Shorter-Lived Tracers,"Noel F Black, Scott McJames, Dan J Kadrmas","Rapid multi-tracer PET, where two to three PET tracers are rapidly scanned with staggered injections, can recover certain imaging measures for each tracer based on differences in tracer kinetics and decay. We previously showed that single-tracer imaging measures can be recovered to a certain extent from rapid dual-tracer (62)Cu - PTSM (blood flow) + (62)Cu - ATSM (hypoxia) tumor imaging. In this work, the feasibility of rapidly imaging (18)F-FDG plus one or two of these shorter-lived secondary tracers was evaluated in the same tumor model. Dynamic PET imaging was performed in four dogs with pre-existing tumors, and the raw scan data was combined to emulate 60 minute long dual- and triple-tracer scans, using the single-tracer scans as gold standards. The multi-tracer data were processed for static (SUV) and kinetic (K(1), K(net)) endpoints for each tracer, followed by linear regression analysis of multi-tracer versus single-tracer results. Static and quantitative dynamic imaging measures of FDG were both accurately recovered from the multi-tracer scans, closely matching the single-tracer FDG standards (R > 0.99). Quantitative blood flow information, as measured by PTSM K(1) and SUV, was also accurately recovered from the multi-tracer scans (R = 0.97). Recovery of ATSM kinetic parameters proved more difficult, though the ATSM SUV was reasonably well recovered (R = 0.92). We conclude that certain additional information from one to two shorter-lived PET tracers may be measured in a rapid multi-tracer scan alongside FDG without compromising the assessment of glucose metabolism. Such additional and complementary information has the potential to improve tumor characterization in vivo, warranting further investigation of rapid multi-tracer techniques.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20046800/
Exact parameter identification in PET pharmacokinetic modeling using the irreversible two tissue compartment model,"Martin Holler, Erion Morina, Georg Schramm","Objective.In quantitative dynamic positron emission tomography (PET), time series of images, reflecting the tissue response to the arterial tracer supply, are reconstructed. This response is described by kinetic parameters, which are commonly determined on basis of the tracer concentration in tissue and the arterial input function. In clinical routine the latter is estimated by arterial blood sampling and analysis, which is a challenging process and thus, attempted to be derived directly from reconstructed PET images. However, a mathematical analysis about the necessity of measurements of the common arterial whole blood activity concentration, and the concentration of free non-metabolized tracer in the arterial plasma, for a successful kinetic parameter identification does not exist. Here we aim to address this problem mathematically.Approach.We consider the identification problem in simultaneous pharmacokinetic modeling of multiple regions of interests of dynamic PET data using the irreversible two-tissue compartment model analytically. In addition to this consideration, the situation of noisy measurements is addressed using Tikhonov regularization. Furthermore, numerical simulations with a regularization approach are carried out to illustrate the analytical results in a synthetic application example.Main results.We provide mathematical proofs showing that, under reasonable assumptions, all metabolic tissue parameters can be uniquely identified without requiring additional blood samples to measure the arterial input function. A connection to noisy measurement data is made via a consistency result, showing that exact reconstruction of the ground-truth tissue parameters is stably maintained in the vanishing noise limit. Furthermore, our numerical experiments suggest that an approximate reconstruction of kinetic parameters according to our analytic results is also possible in practice for moderate noise levels.Significance.The analytical result, which holds in the idealized, noiseless scenario, suggests that for irreversible tracers, fully quantitative dynamic PET imaging is in principle possible without costly arterial blood sampling and metabolite analysis.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38830366/

Inhibition of glycine transporter Type-1 (GlyT1) reuptake is expected to increase the glutamatergic neurotransmission and may serve as treatment for cognitive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. In this article, we present human data from a novel GlyT1 PET tracer, [(18) F]MK-6577. In the process of developing a GlyT1 inhibitor therapeutic, a PET tracer can assist in determining the dose with a high probability of sufficiently testing the mechanism of action. This article reports the human PET studies with [(18) F]MK-6577 for measuring GlyT1 receptor availability at baseline in normal human subjects and occupancy with a GlyT1 inhibitor, MK-2637. Studies were also performed to measure radiation burden and the baseline test-retest (T-RT) variability of the tracer. The effective dose from sequential whole-body dosimetry scans in three male subjects was estimated to be 24.5 ± 2.9 µSV/MBq (mean ± SD). The time-activity curves from T-RT scans modeled satisfactorily using a two tissue compartmental model. The tracer uptake was highest in the pons (VT = 6.7 ± 0.9, BPND = 4.1 ± 0.43) and lowest in the cortex (VT = 2.1 ± 0.5, BPND = 0.60 ± 0.23). VT T-RT variability measured in three subjects was <12% on average. The occupancy scans performed in a cohort of 15 subjects indicated absence of a reference region. The in vivo potency (Occ50 ) of MK-2637 was determined using two methods: A: Lassen plot with a population input function (Occ50 = 106 nM, SE = 20 nM) and B: pseudo reference tissue model using cortex as the pseudo reference region (Occ50 = 141 nM, SE = 21 nM).",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25196464/
A computer simulation study on the effects of input function measurement noise in tracer kinetic modeling with positron emission tomography (PET),"D Feng, X Wang","Tracer kinetic modeling with positron emission tomography (PET) requires measurements of the time-activity curves in both plasma (PTAC) and tissue (TTAC) to estimate physiological parameters, i.e. to fit the parameters of certain compartmental models using PTAC and TTAC as the model input and output functions, respectively. However, the estimation usually ignores the measurement noise in plasma tracer activity curves. The accuracy and reliability of the physiological parameters estimated by ignoring such noise are not well understood. In this paper, effects of noise in [18F] 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) tracer plasma concentration measurements on estimation of local cerebral metabolic rates of glucose (LCMRGlc) with PET is investigated systematically. The PTAC modeling approach used in this paper also provides a realistic means to filter out the noise and to improve the physiological parameter accuracy, which can be potentially used in model-based non-invasive measurements of PTAC.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8467639/
DIFFUSION MODEL-BASED POSTERIOR DISTRIBUTION PREDICTION FOR KINETIC PARAMETER ESTIMATION IN DYNAMIC PET,"Y Djebra, X Liu, T Marin, A Tiss, M Dhaynaut, N Guehl, K Johnson, G El Fakhri, C Ma, J Ouyang","Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a valuable imaging method for studying molecular-level processes in the body, such as hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau) protein aggregates, a hallmark of several neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease. P-tau density and cerebral perfusion can be quantified from PET data using tracer kinetic modeling techniques. However, noise in PET images leads to uncertainty in the estimated kinetic parameters. This can be quantified in a Bayesian framework by the posterior distribution of kinetic parameters given PET measurements. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques can be employed to estimate the posterior distribution, although with significant computational needs. In this paper, we propose to leverage deep learning inference efficiency to infer the posterior distribution. A novel approach using denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) is introduced. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated on a [18F]MK6240 study and compared to an MCMC method. Our approach offered significant reduction in computation time (over 30 times faster than MCMC) and consistently predicted accurate (< 0.8 % mean error) and precise (< 5.77 % standard deviation error) posterior distributions.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39530051/
Quantitation of dynamic total-body PET imaging: recent developments and future perspectives,"Fengyun Gu, Qi Wu","Background: Positron emission tomography (PET) scanning is an important diagnostic imaging technique used in disease diagnosis, therapy planning, treatment monitoring, and medical research. The standardized uptake value (SUV) obtained at a single time frame has been widely employed in clinical practice. Well beyond this simple static measure, more detailed metabolic information can be recovered from dynamic PET scans, followed by the recovery of arterial input function and application of appropriate tracer kinetic models. Many efforts have been devoted to the development of quantitative techniques over the last couple of decades.

Challenges: The advent of new-generation total-body PET scanners characterized by ultra-high sensitivity and long axial field of view, i.e., uEXPLORER (United Imaging Healthcare), PennPET Explorer (University of Pennsylvania), and Biograph Vision Quadra (Siemens Healthineers), further stimulates valuable inspiration to derive kinetics for multiple organs simultaneously. But some emerging issues also need to be addressed, e.g., the large-scale data size and organ-specific physiology. The direct implementation of classical methods for total-body PET imaging without proper validation may lead to less accurate results.

Conclusions: In this contribution, the published dynamic total-body PET datasets are outlined, and several challenges/opportunities for quantitation of such types of studies are presented. An overview of the basic equation, calculation of input function (based on blood sampling, image, population or mathematical model), and kinetic analysis encompassing parametric (compartmental model, graphical plot and spectral analysis) and non-parametric (B-spline and piece-wise basis elements) approaches is provided. The discussion mainly focuses on the feasibilities, recent developments, and future perspectives of these methodologies for a diverse-tissue environment.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37460750/
"Modeling spheroid growth, PET tracer uptake, and treatment effects of the Hsp90 inhibitor NVP-AUY922","Mats Bergstrom, Azita Monazzam, Pasha Razifar, Susan Ide, Raymond Josephsson, Bengt Langstrom","For a PET agent to be successful as a biomarker in early clinical trials of new anticancer agents, some conditions need to be fulfilled: the selected tracer should show a response that is related to the antitumoral effects, the quantitative value of this response should be interpretable to the antitumoral action, and the timing of the PET scan should be optimized to action of the drug. These conditions are not necessarily known at the start of a drug-development program and need to be explored. We proposed a translational imaging activity in which experiments in spheroids and later in xenografts are coupled to modeling of growth inhibition and to the related changes in the kinetics of PET tracers and other biomarkers. In addition, we demonstrated how this information can be used for planning clinical trials.

Methods: The first part of this concept is illustrated in a spheroid model with BT474 breast cancer cells treated with the heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) inhibitor NVP-AUY922. The growth-inhibitory effect after a pulse treatment with the drug was measured with digital image analysis to determine effects on volume with high accuracy. The growth-inhibitory effect was described mathematically by a combined E(max) and time course model fitted to the data. The model was then used to simulate a once-per-week treatment; in these experiments the uptake of the PET tracers (18)F-FDG and 3'-deoxy-3'-(18)F-fluorothymidine ((18)F-FLT) was determined at different doses and different time points.

Results: A drug exposure of 2 h followed by washout of the drug from the culture medium generated growth inhibition that was maximal at the earliest time point of 1 d and decreased exponentially with time during 10-12 d. The uptake of (18)F-FDG per viable tumor volume was minimally affected by the treatment, whereas the (18)F-FLT uptake decreased in correlation with the growth inhibition.

Conclusion: The study suggests a prolonged action of the Hsp90 inhibitor that supports a once-per-week schedule. (18)F-FLT is a suitable tracer for the monitoring of effect, and the (18)F-FLT PET study might be performed within 3 d after dosing.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18552146/
"Kinetic Modeling and Graphical Analysis of 18F-Fluoromethylcholine (FCho), 18F-Fluoroethyltyrosine (FET) and 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET for the Fiscrimination between High-Grade Glioma and Radiation Necrosis in Rats","Julie Bolcaen, Kelly Lybaert, Lieselotte Moerman, Benedicte Descamps, Karel Deblaere, Tom Boterberg, Jean-Pierre Kalala, Caroline Van den Broecke, Filip De Vos, Christian Vanhove, Ingeborg Goethals","Background: Discrimination between glioblastoma (GB) and radiation necrosis (RN) post-irradiation remains challenging but has a large impact on further treatment and prognosis. In this study, the uptake mechanisms of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG), 18F-fluoroethyltyrosine (18F-FET) and 18F-fluoromethylcholine (18F-FCho) positron emission tomography (PET) tracers were investigated in a F98 GB and RN rat model applying kinetic modeling (KM) and graphical analysis (GA) to clarify our previous results.

Methods: Dynamic 18F-FDG (GB n = 6 and RN n = 5), 18F-FET (GB n = 5 and RN n = 5) and 18F-FCho PET (GB n = 5 and RN n = 5) were acquired with continuous arterial blood sampling. Arterial input function (AIF) corrections, KM and GA were performed.

Results: The influx rate (Ki) of 18F-FDG uptake described by a 2-compartmental model (CM) or using Patlak GA, showed more trapping (k3) in GB (0.07 min-1) compared to RN (0.04 min-1) (p = 0.017). K1 of 18F-FET was significantly higher in GB (0.06 ml/ccm/min) compared to RN (0.02 ml/ccm/min), quantified using a 1-CM and Logan GA (p = 0.036). 18F-FCho was rapidly oxidized complicating data interpretation. Using a 1-CM and Logan GA no clear differences were found to discriminate GB from RN.

Conclusions: Based on our results we concluded that using KM and GA both 18F-FDG and 18F-FET were able to discriminate GB from RN. Using a 2-CM model more trapping of 18F-FDG was found in GB compared to RN. Secondly, the influx of 18F-FET was higher in GB compared to RN using a 1-CM model. Important correlations were found between SUV and kinetic or graphical measures for 18F-FDG and 18F-FET. 18F-FCho PET did not allow discrimination between GB and RN.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27559736/
Efficiency gains in tracer identification for nuclear imaging: can in vivo LC-MS/MS evaluation of small molecules screen for successful PET tracers?,"Elizabeth M Joshi, Anne Need, John Schaus, Zhaogen Chen, Dana Benesh, Charles Mitch, Stuart Morton, Thomas J Raub, Lee Phebus, Vanessa Barth","Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging has become a useful noninvasive technique to explore molecular biology within living systems; however, the utility of this method is limited by the availability of suitable radiotracers to probe specific targets and disease biology. Methods to identify potential areas of improvement in the ability to predict small molecule performance as tracers prior to radiolabeling would speed the discovery of novel tracers. In this retrospective analysis, we characterized the brain penetration or peak SUV (standardized uptake value), binding potential (BP), and brain exposure kinetics across a series of known, nonradiolabeled PET ligands using in vivo LC-MS/MS (liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry) and correlated these parameters with the reported PET ligand performance in nonhuman primates and humans available in the literature. The PET tracers studied included those reported to label G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), intracellular enzymes, and transporters. Additionally, data for each tracer was obtained from a mouse brain uptake assay (MBUA), previously published, where blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration and clearance parameters were assessed and compared against similar data collected on a broad compound set of central nervous system (CNS) therapeutic compounds. The BP and SUV identified via nonradiolabeled LC-MS/MS, while different from the published values observed in the literature PET tracer data, allowed for an identification of initial criteria values we sought to facilitate increased potential for success from our early discovery screening paradigm. Our analysis showed that successful, as well as novel, clinical PET tracers exhibited BP of greater than 1.5 and peak SUVs greater than approximately 150% at 5 min post dose in rodents. The brain kinetics appeared similar between both techniques despite differences in tracer dose, suggesting linearity across these dose ranges. The assessment of tracers in a CNS exposure model, the mouse brain uptake assessment (MBUA), showed that those compound with initial brain-to-plasma ratios >2 and unbound fraction in brain homogenate >0.01 were more likely to be clinically successful PET ligands. Taken together, early incorporation of a LC/MS/MS cold tracer discovery assay and a parallel MBUA can be an useful screening paradigm to prioritize and rank order potential novel PET radioligands during early tracer discovery efforts. Compounds considered for continued in vivo PET assessments can be identified quickly by leveraging in vitro affinity and selectivity measures, coupled with data from a MBUA, primarily the 5 min brain-to-plasma ratio and unbound fraction data. Coupled utilization of these data creates a strategy to efficiently screen for the identification of appropriate chemical space to invest in for radiotracer discovery.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25247893/
Measurement of cardiovascular function using a novel view-sharing PET reconstruction method and tracer kinetic analysis,"Paul R Territo, Amanda A Riley, Brian P McCarthy, Gary D Hutchins","Recent advancements in PET instrumentation have made the non-invasive assessment of cardiovascular function in small animals a reality. The majority of small animal PET systems use stationary detector gantries, thus affording high temporal resolution imaging of cardiac function. Systems designed to maximize spatial resolution and detection sensitivity employing rotating gantry designs are suboptimal when high temporal resolution imaging is needed. To overcome this limitation, the current work developed a novel view-sharing data analysis scheme suitable for dynamic cardiac PET imaging using18F-NaF as the tracer and tracer kinetic model analysis. This scheme was tested in a rat model of cardiovascular function where the relationship between direct transonic flow measures of cardiac output were highly correlated (f(x) = 1.0216x - 24.233, R = 0.9158, p < 0.001) with the new model. Similarly, derived measures of stroke volume were also highly correlated (f(x) = 0.9655x - 0.0428, R = 0.9453, p < 0.001) with the current approach. Administration of xylazine caused a statistically significant increase in stroke volume (0.32 ± 0.07 ml, p = 0.003, n = 4) and a significant decrease in both heart rate (-155 ± 7.1 beats/min, p < 0.001, n = 4) and cardiac output (-75.9 ± 23.0 ml/kg min, p = 0.01, n = 4). These findings suggest that the new sinogram binning and kinetic modeling methods produce reliable cardiac function measures suitable for longitudinal monitoring of cardiovascular function.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27766592/
Kinetics modeling and occupancy studies of a novel C-11 PET tracer for VAChT in nonhuman primates,"Hongjun Jin, Xiang Zhang, Xuyi Yue, Hui Liu, Junfeng Li, Hao Yang, Hubert Flores, Yi Su, Stanley M Parsons, Joel S Perlmutter, Zhude Tu","Introduction: Deficits in cholinergic function have been found in the aged brain and in neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). The vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) is a reliable biomarker for the cholinergic system. We previously reported the initial in vitro and ex vivo characterization of (-)-[(11)C]TZ659 as a VAChT specific ligand. Here, we report the in vivo specificity, tracer kinetics, and dose-occupancy studies in the nonhuman primate brain.

Methods: MicroPET brain imaging of (-)-[(11)C]TZ659 was performed under baseline conditions in two male macaques. Tracer kinetic modeling was carried out using a two-tissue compartment model (2TCM) and Logan plot with arterial blood input function and using a simplified reference tissue model (SRTM) and Logan plot (LoganREF) without blood input. Specificity for VAChT was demonstrated by pretreatment with (+)-pentazocine, (-)-vesamicol, or S-(-)-eticlopride. Target occupancy (Occ) was calculated following pretreatment with escalating doses of (-)-vesamicol.

Results: Baseline PET imaging revealed selective retention in the striatum with rapid clearance from the cerebellar hemispheres as a reference region. Total volume of distribution (VT) values derived from both 2TCM and Logan analysis with blood input revealed ~3-fold higher levels of (-)-[(11)C]TZ659 in the striatum than the cerebellar hemispheres. Injection of (-)-vesamicol either as a blocking or displacing agent significantly reduced striatal uptake of (-)-[(11)C]TZ659. In contrast, pretreatment with the sigma-1 ligand (+)-pentazocine had no impact. Pretreatment with the S-(-)-eticlopride, a dopamine D2-like receptor antagonist, increased striatal uptake of (-)-[(11)C]TZ659. Striatal binding potential (BPND, range of 0.33-1.6 with cerebellar hemispheres as the reference region) showed good correlation (r(2)=0.97) between SRTM and LoganREF. Occupancy studies found that ~0.0057 mg/kg of (-)-vesamicol produced 50% VAChT occupancy in the striatum.

Conclusion: (-)-[(11)C]TZ659 demonstrated specific and reversible VAChT binding and favorable pharmacokinetic properties for assessing the density of VAChT in the living brain.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26872437/
Quantitative Total-Body Imaging of Blood Flow with High-Temporal-Resolution Early Dynamic 18F-FDG PET Kinetic Modeling,"Kevin J Chung, Abhijit J Chaudhari, Lorenzo Nardo, Terry Jones, Moon S Chen Jr, Ramsey D Badawi, Simon R Cherry, Guobao Wang","Past efforts to measure blood flow with the widely available radiotracer18F-FDG were limited to tissues with high18F-FDG extraction fraction. In this study, we developed an early dynamic18F-FDG PET method with high-temporal-resolution (HTR) kinetic modeling to assess total-body blood flow based on deriving the vascular phase of18F-FDG transit and conducted a pilot comparison study against a11C-butanol flow-tracer reference.Methods:The first 2 min of dynamic PET scans were reconstructed at HTR (60 × 1 s/frame, 30 × 2 s/frame) to resolve the rapid passage of the radiotracer through blood vessels. In contrast to existing methods that use blood-to-tissue transport rate as a surrogate of blood flow, our method directly estimated blood flow using a distributed kinetic model (adiabatic approximation to tissue homogeneity [AATH] model). To validate our18F-FDG measurements of blood flow against a reference flow-specific radiotracer, we analyzed total-body dynamic PET images of 6 human participants scanned with both18F-FDG and11C-butanol. An additional 34 total-body dynamic18F-FDG PET images of healthy participants were analyzed for comparison against published blood-flow ranges. Regional blood flow was estimated across the body, and total-body parametric imaging of blood flow was conducted for visual assessment. AATH and standard compartment model fitting was compared using the Akaike information criterion at different temporal resolutions.Results:18F-FDG blood flow was in quantitative agreement with flow measured from11C-butanol across same-subject regional measurements (Pearson correlation coefficient, 0.955;P< 0.001; linear regression slope and intercept, 0.973 and -0.012, respectively), which was visually corroborated by total-body blood-flow parametric imaging. Our method resolved a wide range of blood-flow values across the body in broad agreement with published ranges (e.g., healthy cohort values of 0.51 ± 0.12 mL/min/cm3in the cerebral cortex and 2.03 ± 0.64 mL/min/cm3in the lungs). HTR (1-2 s/frame) was required for AATH modeling.Conclusion:Total-body blood-flow imaging was feasible using early dynamic18F-FDG PET with HTR kinetic modeling. This method may be combined with standard18F-FDG PET methods to enable efficient single-tracer multiparametric flow-metabolism imaging, with numerous research and clinical applications in oncology, cardiovascular disease, pain medicine, and neuroscience.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40306973/
How to design PET experiments to study neurochemistry: application to alcoholism,"Evan D Morris, Molly V Lucas, J Ryan Petrulli, Kelly P Cosgrove","Positron Emission Tomography (PET) (and the related Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography) is a powerful imaging tool with a molecular specificity and sensitivity that are unique among imaging modalities. PET excels in the study of neurochemistry in three ways: 1) It can detect and quantify neuroreceptor molecules; 2) it can detect and quantify changes in neurotransmitters; and 3) it can detect and quantify exogenous drugs delivered to the brain. To carry out any of these applications, the user must harness the power of kinetic modeling. Further, the quality of the information gained is only as good as the soundness of the experimental design. This article reviews the concepts behind the three main uses of PET, the rationale behind kinetic modeling of PET data, and some of the key considerations when planning a PET experiment.

PET [11C]acetate is also a perfusion tracer for kidney evaluation purposes,"Gabrielle Normand, Sandrine Lemoine, Didier Le Bars, Ines Merida, Zacharie Irace, Thomas Troalen, Nicolas Costes, Laurent Juillard","Rationale: Renal positron emission tomography (PET) functional imaging allows non-invasive and dynamic measurements of functional and metabolic parameters. [15O]H2O is used as a perfusion tracer, and [11C]acetate as an oxidative metabolism in this purpose, requiring two injections to assess those fundamental parameters. Yet, in cardiac physiology study, the high first-pass myocardial extraction fraction of [11C]acetate allowed to use its influx rate as a blood flow marker too. Since [11C]acetate has been characterized by a 20-25% single pass renal extraction in dogs, it could be used as a potential tracer for renal perfusion. The aim of this study was to determine whether [11C]acetate influx rate can be used as quantitative in vivo marker of kidney perfusion in human.

Methods: In 10 healthy subjects, dynamic PET acquisitions were performed after [15O]H2O and [11C]acetate injections spaced by a 15-minute interval. As previously validated, with compartmental modeling of kinetics, renal perfusion and oxidative metabolism were estimated respectively with influx rate of [15O]H2O and efflux rate of [11C]acetate. Additionally, influx rate of [11C]acetate was regressed to influx rate of [15O]H2O.

Results: Renal time activity curves of [11C]-acetate was best fitted with a mono compartmental model compared to a bi-compartmental model (p < 0.0001). [11C]acetate influx rate was significantly correlated with perfusion quantified with [15O]H2O (r2= 0.37, p < 0.001) at baseline. This regression allowed the computation of a renal [11C]acetate extraction fraction (EF), and further the computation of renal blood flow from its influx rate.

Conclusion: In healthy subjects, over a wide range of renal perfusion, direct estimates of renal oxygen consumption as well as tissue perfusion can be obtained by PET with a single tracer [11C]acetate. This approach needs to be validated in CKD patients, and would be of great interest to design clinical protocol aiming at evaluating ischemic nephropathies candidate to revascularization.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31675615/

Important for quantification are the kinetic modeling methods used to determine biologically-relevant parameters of tracer-tissue interaction. In this work, we evaluate modeling algorithms for the dopaminergic tracers (11)C-dihydrotetrabenazine (DTBZ), (11)C-methylphenidate (MP), and (11)C-raclopride (RAC), used to image the dopaminergic system in the unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine lesioned rat model of Parkinson's disease. For the presynaptic tracers, PET measures are compared with autoradiographic binding measurements using DTBZ and [(3)H]WIN 35,428 (WIN). We independently developed a new variant of the tissue-input Logan graphical modeling method, and compared its performance with the simplified Logan graphical method and the simplified reference tissue with basis functions method (SRTM), for region of interest (ROI) averaged time activity curves (TACs) and parametric imaging. The modified graphical method was found to be effectively unbiased by target tissue noise and has advantages for parametric imaging, while all tested methods were equivalent for ROI-averaged data.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19862685/
Non-invasive quantification of 18F-florbetaben with total-body EXPLORER PET,"Emily N Holy, Elizabeth Li, Anjan Bhattarai, Evan Fletcher, Evelyn R Alfaro, Danielle J Harvey, Benjamin A Spencer, Simon R Cherry, Charles S DeCarli, Audrey P Fan","Purpose: Kinetic modeling of18F-florbetaben provides important quantification of brain amyloid deposition in research and clinical settings but its use is limited by the requirement of arterial blood data for quantitative PET. The total-body EXPLORER PET scanner supports the dynamic acquisition of a full human body simultaneously and permits noninvasive image-derived input functions (IDIFs) as an alternative to arterial blood sampling. This study quantified brain amyloid burden with kinetic modeling, leveraging dynamic18F-florbetaben PET in aorta IDIFs and the brain in an elderly cohort.

Methods: 18F-florbetaben dynamic PET imaging was performed on the EXPLORER system with tracer injection (300 MBq) in 3 individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD), 3 with mild cognitive impairment, and 9 healthy controls. Image-derived input functions were extracted from the descending aorta with manual regions of interest based on the first 30 seconds after injection. Dynamic time-activity curves (TACs) for 110 minutes were fitted to the two-tissue compartment model (2TCM) using population-based metabolite corrected IDIFs to calculate total and specific distribution volumes (VT, Vs) in key brain regions with early amyloid accumulation. Non-displaceable binding potential (BPND) was also calculated from the multi-reference tissue model (MRTM).

Results: Amyloid-positive (AD) patients showed the highest VTand VSin anterior cingulate, posterior cingulate, and precuneus, consistent withBPNDanalysis.BPNDand VTfrom kinetic models were correlated (r2= 0.46, P<2e-16) with a stronger positive correlation observed in amyloid-positive participants, indicating reliable model fits with the IDIFs. VTfrom 2TCM was highly correlated (r2= 0.65, P< 2e-16) with Logan graphical VTestimation.

Conclusion: Non-invasive quantification of amyloid binding from total-body18F-florbetaben PET data is feasible using aorta IDIFs with high agreement between kinetic distribution volume parameters compared toBPNDin amyloid-positive and negative older individuals.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38234716/
Models for computer simulation studies of input functions for tracer kinetic modeling with positron emission tomography,"D Feng, S C Huang, X Wang","In tracer kinetic modeling with Positron Emission Tomography (PET), the direct measurement (piecewise linear approximation) of plasma time-activity curve of tracer (PTAC) is often used as the input function to estimate regional physiological parameters. However, no explicit general model is available for PTAC itself, which limits the further study of the effects of PTAC, such as PTAC measurement noise or PTAC sampling schedules, on the physiological parameters estimation. A PTAC model is proposed in this paper and compared with other four possible candidates. Eight sets of [18F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) experimental data were used to test the models and several statistical criteria were used to validate their adequacy. An application of the model to improve the estimation of local cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (LCMRGlc) is presented. This model is also expected to be useful for generating realistic PTAC curves in computer simulation studies of other tracers and their kinetic modeling characteristics.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8449593/
A computer simulation study on the input function sampling schedules in tracer kinetic modeling with positron emission tomography (PET),"D Feng, X Wang, H Yan","Tracer kinetic modeling with positron emission tomography (PET) requires measurements of the time-activity curves in both plasma (PTAC) and tissue (TTAC) to estimate physiological parameters, i.e. to fit the parameters of certain compartmental models using PTAC and TTAC as the model input and output functions, respectively. In this paper, we first explored the optimal blood sampling schedule (OBSS) for the input function, based on the tracer [18F]2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) blood sample experimental data. Then using a 5-parameter FDG model we investigated the effects of the plasma sampling schedule, as well as PTAC measurement noise, on the estimation accuracy and reliability of FDG model macro- and micro-parameters and the physiological parameter local cerebral metabolic rates of glucose (LCMRGlc), using computer simulation. Three different methods were used: (a) estimation of the FDG model parameters ignoring PTAC noise using the traditional PTAC schedule (non-OBSS); (b) estimation of the PTAC model parameters and FDG model parameters simultaneously using both non-OBSS and OBSS; (c) estimation of the PTAC model parameters first, then the FDG model parameters using both non-OBSS and OBSS. The results show that OBSS can provide more reliable estimates and largely simplifies the experiment operations.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7705075/

"(18)F-alfatide II and (18)F-FDG dual-tracer dynamic PET for parametric, early prediction of tumor response to therapy","Jinxia Guo, Ning Guo, Lixin Lang, Dale O Kiesewetter, Qingguo Xie, Quanzheng Li, Henry S Eden, Gang Niu, Xiaoyuan Chen","A single dynamic PET acquisition using multiple tracers administered closely in time could provide valuable complementary information about a tumor's status under quasiconstant conditions. This study aimed to investigate the utility of dual-tracer dynamic PET imaging with (18)F-alfatide II ((18)F-AlF-NOTA-E[PEG4-c(RGDfk)]2) and (18)F-FDG for parametric monitoring of tumor responses to therapy.

Methods: We administered doxorubicin to one group of athymic nude mice with U87MG tumors and paclitaxel protein-bound particles to another group of mice with MDA-MB-435 tumors. To monitor therapeutic responses, we performed dual-tracer dynamic imaging, in sessions that lasted 90 min, starting with injection via the tail vein catheters with (18)F-alfatide II, followed 40 min later by (18)F-FDG. To achieve signal separation of the 2 tracers, we fit a 3-compartment reversible model to the time-activity curve of (18)F-alfatide II for the 40 min before (18)F-FDG injection and then extrapolated to 90 min. The (18)F-FDG tumor time-activity curve was isolated from the 90-min dual-tracer tumor time-activity curve by subtracting the fitted (18)F-alfatide II tumor time-activity curve. With separated tumor time-activity curves, the (18)F-alfatide II binding potential (Bp = k3/k4) and volume of distribution (VD) and (18)F-FDG influx rate ((K1 × k3)/(k2 + k3)) based on the Patlak method were calculated to validate the signal recovery in a comparison with 60-min single-tracer imaging and to monitor therapeutic response.

Results: The transport and binding rate parameters K1-k3 of (18)F-alfatide II, calculated from the first 40 min of the dual-tracer dynamic scan, as well as Bp and VD correlated well with the parameters from the 60-min single-tracer scan (R(2) > 0.95). Compared with the results of single-tracer PET imaging, (18)F-FDG tumor uptake and influx were recovered well from dual-tracer imaging. On doxorubicin treatment, whereas no significant changes in static tracer uptake values of (18)F-alfatide II or (18)F-FDG were observed, both (18)F-alfatide II Bp and (18)F-FDG influx from kinetic analysis in tumors showed significant decreases. For therapy of MDA-MB-435 tumors with paclitaxel protein-bound particles, a significant decrease was observed only with (18)F-alfatide II Bp value from kinetic analysis but not (18)F-FDG influx.

Conclusion: The parameters fitted with compartmental modeling from the dual-tracer dynamic imaging are consistent with those from single-tracer imaging, substantiating the feasibility of this methodology. Even though no significant differences in tumor size were found until 5 d after doxorubicin treatment started, at day 3 there were already substantial differences in (18)F-alfatide II Bp and (18)F-FDG influx rate. Dual-tracer imaging can measure (18)F-alfatide II Bp value and (18)F-FDG influx simultaneously to evaluate tumor angiogenesis and metabolism. Such changes are known to precede anatomic changes, and thus parametric imaging may offer the promise of early prediction of therapy response.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24232871/
Patient-Adaptive Population-Based Modeling of Arterial Input Functions,"Zhaoyan Xiu, Mark Muzi, Jian Huang, Eric Wolsztynski","Kinetic modeling of dynamic PET data requires knowledge of tracer concentration in blood plasma, described by the arterial input function (AIF). Arterial blood sampling is the gold standard for AIF measurement, but is invasive and labour intensive. A number of methods have been proposed to accurately estimate the AIF directly from blood sampling and/or imaging data. Here we consider fitting a patient-adaptive mixture of historical population time course profiles to estimate individual AIFs. Travel time of a tracer atom from the injection site to the right ventricle of the heart is modeled as a realization from a Gamma distribution, and the time this atom spends in circulation before being sampled is represented by a subject-specific linear mixture of population profiles. These functions are estimated from independent population data. Individual AIFs are obtained by projection onto this basis of population profile components. The model incorporates knowledge of injection duration into the fit, allowing for varying injection protocols. Analyses of arterial sampling data from 18F-FDG, 15O-H2O and 18F-FLT clinical studies show that the proposed model can outperform reference techniques. The statistically significant gain achieved by using population data to train the basis components, instead of fitting these from the single individual sampling data, is measured on the FDG cohort. Kinetic analyses of simulated data demonstrate the reliability and potential benefit of this approach in estimating physiological parameters. These results are further supported by numerical simulations that demonstrate convergence and stability of the proposed technique under varying training population sizes and noise levels.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36094987/
Non-invasive kinetic modelling of PET tracers with radiometabolites using a constrained simultaneous estimation method: evaluation with 11C-SB201745,"Hasan Sari, Kjell Erlandsson, Lisbeth Marner, Ian Law, Henrik B W Larsson, Kris Thielemans, Sébastien Ourselin, Simon Arridge, David Atkinson, Brian F Hutton","Background: Kinetic analysis of dynamic PET data requires an accurate knowledge of available PET tracer concentration within blood plasma over time, known as the arterial input function (AIF). The gold standard method used to measure the AIF requires serial arterial blood sampling over the course of the PET scan, which is an invasive procedure and makes this method less practical in clinical settings. Traditional image-derived methods are limited to specific tracers and are not accurate if metabolites are present in the plasma.

Results: In this work, we utilise an image-derived whole blood curve measurement to reduce the computational complexity of the simultaneous estimation method (SIME), which is capable of estimating the AIF directly from tissue time activity curves (TACs). This method was applied to data obtained from a serotonin receptor study (11C-SB207145) and estimated parameter results are compared to results obtained using the original SIME and gold standard AIFs derived from arterial samples. Reproducibility of the method was assessed using test-retest data. It was shown that the incorporation of image-derived information increased the accuracy of total volume of distribution (VT) estimates, averaged across all regions, by 40% and non-displaceable binding potential (BPND) estimates by 16% compared to the original SIME. Particular improvements were observed in K1parameter estimates. BPNDestimates, based on the proposed method and the gold standard arterial sample-derived AIF, were not significantly different (P=0.7).

Conclusions: The results of this work indicate that the proposed method with prior AIF information obtained from a partial volume corrected image-derived whole blood curve, and modelled parent fraction, has the potential to be used as an alternative non-invasive method to perform kinetic analysis of tracers with metabolite products.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29971517/
"Whole-Body Multiparametric PET in Clinical Oncology: Current Status, Challenges, and Opportunities","Tyler J Fraum, Hasan Sari, André H Dias, Ole L Munk, Thomas Pyka, Anne M Smith, Osama R Mawlawi, Richard Laforest, Guobao Wang","The interpretation of clinical oncologic PET studies has historically used static reconstructions based on SUVs. SUVs and SUV-based images have important limitations, including dependence on uptake times and reduced conspicuity of tracer-avid lesions in organs with high background uptake. The acquisition of dynamic PET images enables additional PET reconstructions via Patlak modeling, which assumes that a tracer is irreversibly trapped by tissues of interest. The resulting multiparametric PET images capture a tracer's net trapping rate and apparent volume of distribution, separating the contributions of bound and free tracer fractions to the PET signal captured in the SUV. Potential benefits of multiparametric PET include higher quantitative stability, superior lesion conspicuity, and greater accuracy for differentiating malignant and benign lesions. However, the imaging protocols necessary for multiparametric PET are inherently more complex and time intensive, despite the recent introduction of automated or semiautomated scanner-based reconstruction packages. In this Review, we examine the current state of multiparametric PET in whole-body oncologic imaging. We summarize the Patlak method and relevant tracer kinetics, discuss clinical workflows and protocol considerations, and highlight clinical challenges and opportunities. We aim to help oncologic imagers make informed decisions about whether to implement multiparametric PET in their clinical practices.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39230403/

Tracer concentration 3-min time courses were measured in the femoral artery and PV by blood sampling. Blood flow was measured in the HA and PV using flow-meters. A model for transfer of tracer through the splanchnic circulation was used to estimate values of a tracer-specific model parameter β. Tracer-specific mean values of β were used to estimate tracer concentration time courses in the PV from the measured arterial concentration. A model-derived dual-input was calculated using the mean HA flow fraction (0.25) and validated by comparison of the use of the measured dual-input and a kinetic model with a fixed ""true"" K(1)(true), i.e. clearance of tracer from blood to liver cells.

Results: The rank order of the means of β was CO < FDG ≈ MG < FDGal < H(2)O, reflecting their different splanchnic mean transit times. Estimated K(1)(est) was not significantly different from ""true"" K(1)(true).

Conclusion: The hepatic dual tracer input, which is of great importance for the assessment of processes such as transfer across the plasma-hepatocyte membrane or hepatic blood perfusion, can be well approximated in pigs without the necessity to sample PV blood and measure hepatic blood flow; only arterial blood sampling is needed.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20882283/
Quantitative Myocardial Perfusion with Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced Imaging in MRI and CT: Theoretical Models and Current Implementation,"G J Pelgrim, A Handayani, H Dijkstra, N H J Prakken, R H J A Slart, M Oudkerk, P M A Van Ooijen, R Vliegenthart, P E Sijens","Technological advances in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT), including higher spatial and temporal resolution, have made the prospect of performing absolute myocardial perfusion quantification possible, previously only achievable with positron emission tomography (PET). This could facilitate integration of myocardial perfusion biomarkers into the current workup for coronary artery disease (CAD), as MRI and CT systems are more widely available than PET scanners. Cardiac PET scanning remains expensive and is restricted by the requirement of a nearby cyclotron. Clinical evidence is needed to demonstrate that MRI and CT have similar accuracy for myocardial perfusion quantification as PET. However, lack of standardization of acquisition protocols and tracer kinetic model selection complicates comparison between different studies and modalities. The aim of this overview is to provide insight into the different tracer kinetic models for quantitative myocardial perfusion analysis and to address typical implementation issues in MRI and CT. We compare different models based on their theoretical derivations and present the respective consequences for MRI and CT acquisition parameters, highlighting the interplay between tracer kinetic modeling and acquisition settings.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27088083/
Quantification of O-(2-[18F]fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine kinetics in glioma,"Thomas Koopman, Niels Verburg, Robert C Schuit, Petra J W Pouwels, Pieter Wesseling, Albert D Windhorst, Otto S Hoekstra, Philip C de Witt Hamer, Adriaan A Lammertsma, Ronald Boellaard, Maqsood Yaqub","Background: This study identified the optimal tracer kinetic model for quantification of dynamic O-(2-[18F]fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine ([18F]FET) positron emission tomography (PET) studies in seven patients with diffuse glioma (four glioblastoma, three lower grade glioma). The performance of more simplified approaches was evaluated by comparison with the optimal compartment model. Additionally, the relationship with cerebral blood flow-determined by [15O]H2O PET-was investigated.

Results: The optimal tracer kinetic model was the reversible two-tissue compartment model. Agreement analysis of binding potential estimates derived from reference tissue input models with the distribution volume ratio (DVR)-1 derived from the plasma input model showed no significant average difference and limits of agreement of - 0.39 and 0.37. Given the range of DVR-1 (- 0.25 to 1.5), these limits are wide. For the simplified methods, the 60-90 min tumour-to-blood ratio to parent plasma concentration yielded the highest correlation with volume of distribution VTas calculated by the plasma input model (r = 0.97). The 60-90 min standardized uptake value (SUV) showed better correlation with VT(r = 0.77) than SUV based on earlier intervals. The 60-90 min SUV ratio to contralateral healthy brain tissue showed moderate agreement with DVR with no significant average difference and limits of agreement of - 0.24 and 0.30. A significant but low correlation was found between VTand CBF in the tumour regions (r = 0.61, p = 0.007).

Conclusion: Uptake of [18F]FET was best modelled by a reversible two-tissue compartment model. Reference tissue input models yielded estimates of binding potential which did not correspond well with plasma input-derived DVR-1. In comparison, SUV ratio to contralateral healthy brain tissue showed slightly better performance, if measured at the 60-90 min interval. SUV showed only moderate correlation with VT. VTshows correlation with CBF in tumour.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30066053/
Tracer kinetic modelling of receptor data with mathematical metabolite correction,"C Burger, A Buck","Quantitation of metabolic processes with dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) and tracer kinetic modelling relies on the time course of authentic ligand in plasma, i.e. the input curve. The determination of the latter often requires the measurement of labelled metabolites, a laborious procedure. In this study we examined the possibility of mathematical metabolite correction, which might obviate the need for actual metabolite measurements. Mathematical metabolite correction was implemented by estimating the input curve together with kinetic tissue parameters. The general feasibility of the approach was evaluated in a Monte Carlo simulation using a two tissue compartment model. The method was then applied to a series of five human carbon-11 iomazenil PET studies. The measured cerebral tissue time-activity curves were fitted with a single tissue compartment model. For mathematical metabolite correction the input curve following the peak was approximated by a sum of three decaying exponentials, the amplitudes and characteristic half-times of which were then estimated by the fitting routine. In the simulation study the parameters used to generate synthetic tissue time-activity curves (K1-k4) were refitted with reasonable identifiability when using mathematical metabolite correction. Absolute quantitation of distribution volumes was found to be possible provided that the metabolite and the kinetic models are adequate. If the kinetic model is oversimplified, the linearity of the correlation between true and estimated distribution volumes is still maintained, although the linear regression becomes dependent on the input curve. These simulation results were confirmed when applying mathematical metabolite correction to the [11C]iomazenil study. Estimates of the distribution volume calculated with a measured input curve were linearly related to the estimates calculated using mathematical metabolite correction with correlation coefficients >0.990. However, the slope of the regression line displayed considerable variability among the subjects (0.33-0.95), demonstrating that absolute quantitation of the distribution volume was impaired. Mathematical metabolite correction is a feasible method and may prove useful in cases where actual metabolite data cannot be obtained. The potential for absolute quantitation seems limited, but the method allows the quantitative assessment of regional ratios of receptor measures.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8698059/
Visual evaluation of kinetic characteristics of PET probe for neuroreceptors using a two-phase graphic plot analysis,"Hiroshi Ito, Yoko Ikoma, Chie Seki, Yasuyuki Kimura, Hiroshi Kawaguchi, Hiroyuki Takuwa, Masanori Ichise, Tetsuya Suhara, Iwao Kanno","Objectives In PET studies for neuroreceptors, tracer kinetics are described by the two-tissue compartment model (2-TCM), and binding parameters, including the total distribution volume (VT), non-displaceable distribution volume (VND), and binding potential (BPND), can be determined from model parameters estimated by kinetic analysis. The stability of binding parameter estimates depends on the kinetic characteristics of radioligands. To describe these kinetic characteristics, we previously developed a two-phase graphic plot analysis in which VNDand VTcan be estimated from the x-intercept of regression lines for early and delayed phases, respectively. In this study, we applied this graphic plot analysis to visual evaluation of the kinetic characteristics of radioligands for neuroreceptors, and investigated a relationship between the shape of these graphic plots and the stability of binding parameters estimated by the kinetic analysis with 2-TCM in simulated brain tissue time-activity curves (TACs) with various binding parameters. Methods 90-min TACs were generated with the arterial input function and assumed kinetic parameters according to 2-TCM. Graphic plot analysis was applied to these simulated TACs, and the curvature of the plot for each TAC was evaluated visually. TACs with several noise levels were also generated with various kinetic parameters, and the bias and variation of binding parameters estimated by kinetic analysis were calculated in each TAC. These bias and variation were compared with the shape of graphic plots. Results The graphic plots showed larger curvature for TACs with higher specific binding and slower dissociation of specific binding. The quartile deviations of VNDand BPNDdetermined by kinetic analysis were smaller for radioligands with slow dissociation. Conclusions The larger curvature of graphic plots for radioligands with slow dissociation might indicate a stable determination of VNDand BPNDby kinetic analysis. For investigation of the kinetics of radioligands, such kinetic characteristics should be considered.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28181119/
Direct Parametric Image Reconstruction in Reduced Parameter Space for Rapid Multi-Tracer PET Imaging,"Xiaoyin Cheng, Zhoulei Li, Zhen Liu, Nassir Navab, Sung-Cheng Huang, Ulrich Keller, Sibylle I Ziegler, Kuangyu Shi","The separation of multiple PET tracers within an overlapping scan based on intrinsic differences of tracer pharmacokinetics is challenging, due to limited signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of PET measurements and high complexity of fitting models. In this study, we developed a direct parametric image reconstruction (DPIR) method for estimating kinetic parameters and recovering single tracer information from rapid multi-tracer PET measurements. This is achieved by integrating a multi-tracer model in a reduced parameter space (RPS) into dynamic image reconstruction. This new RPS model is reformulated from an existing multi-tracer model and contains fewer parameters for kinetic fitting. Ordered-subsets expectation-maximization (OSEM) was employed to approximate log-likelihood function with respect to kinetic parameters. To incorporate the multi-tracer model, an iterative weighted nonlinear least square (WNLS) method was employed. The proposed multi-tracer DPIR (MT-DPIR) algorithm was evaluated on dual-tracer PET simulations ([18F]FDG and [11C]MET) as well as on preclinical PET measurements ([18F]FLT and [18F]FDG). The performance of the proposed algorithm was compared to the indirect parameter estimation method with the original dual-tracer model. The respective contributions of the RPS technique and the DPIR method to the performance of the new algorithm were analyzed in detail. For the preclinical evaluation, the tracer separation results were compared with single [18F]FDG scans of the same subjects measured two days before the dual-tracer scan. The results of the simulation and preclinical studies demonstrate that the proposed MT-DPIR method can improve the separation of multiple tracers for PET image quantification and kinetic parameter estimations.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25700443/
Positron emission tomography in schizophrenia: a new perspective,"Neva H Patel, Nora S Vyas, Basant K Puri, Kuldip S Nijran, Adil Al-Nahhas","PET is an important functional imaging technique that can be used to investigate neurotransmitter receptors and transporters directly by mapping human brain function. PET is increasingly being used greatly to advance our understanding of the neurobiology and pathophysiology of schizophrenia.

Methods: This review focuses on the use of PET tracers and kinetic modeling in identifying regional brain abnormalities and regions associated with cognitive functioning in schizophrenia. A variety of PET tracers have been used to identify brain abnormalities, including (11)C, (15)O-water, (18)F-fallypride, and L-3,4-dihydroxy-6-(18)F-fluorophenylalanine ((18)F-FDOPA).

Results: Some studies have used compartmental modeling to determine tracer binding kinetics. The most consistent findings show a difference in the dopamine content in the prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate gyrus, and hippocampus between healthy controls and patients with schizophrenia. Studies also show a higher density of D(2) receptors in the striatum and neural brain dysconnectivity.

Conclusion: Future investigations integrating clinical, imaging, genetic, and cognitive aspects are warranted to gain a better understanding of the pathophysiology of this disorder.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20237027/
A dual tracer PET-MRI protocol for the quantitative measure of regional brain energy substrates uptake in the rat,"Maggie Roy, Scott Nugent, Sébastien Tremblay, Maxime Descoteaux, Jean-François Beaudoin, Luc Tremblay, Roger Lecomte, Stephen C Cunnane","We present a method for comparing the uptake of the brain's two key energy substrates: glucose and ketones (acetoacetate [AcAc] in this case) in the rat. The developed method is a small-animal positron emission tomography (PET) protocol, in which (11)C-AcAc and (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) are injected sequentially in each animal. This dual tracer PET acquisition is possible because of the short half-life of (11)C (20.4 min). The rats also undergo a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquisition seven days before the PET protocol. Prior to image analysis, PET and MRI images are coregistered to allow the measurement of regional cerebral uptake (cortex, hippocampus, striatum, and cerebellum). A quantitative measure of (11)C-AcAc and (18)F-FDG brain uptake (cerebral metabolic rate; μmol/100 g/min) is determined by kinetic modeling using the image-derived input function (IDIF) method. Our new dual tracer PET protocol is robust and flexible; the two tracers used can be replaced by different radiotracers to evaluate other processes in the brain. Moreover, our protocol is applicable to the study of brain fuel supply in multiple conditions such as normal aging and neurodegenerative pathologies such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24430432/
Radioligand studies: imaging and quantitative analysis,Adriaan A Lammertsma,"Radioligand studies enable visualisation and measurement of molecular pathways and pharmacokinetic processes. Using positron emission tomography, accurate measurements of the time course of radioligand uptake and clearance can be obtained. A tracer kinetic model is needed to derive physiological or pharmacokinetic parameters from these tissue time-activity curves. In addition, an input function that indicates delivery to the tissue is required. Usually this will be the arterial plasma curve. For receptor studies, where binding potential is the parameter of interest, it might also be possible to avoid arterial sampling provided a tissue can be defined that is devoid of receptors.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12468014/
Preclinical evaluation of [(18)F]JNJ42259152 as a PET tracer for PDE10A,"S Celen, M Koole, M Ooms, M De Angelis, I Sannen, J Cornelis, J Alcazar, M Schmidt, A Verbruggen, X Langlois, K Van Laere, J I Andrés, G Bormans","Phosphodiesterase-10A (PDE10A) is implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders involving basal ganglia neurotransmission, such as schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder and Huntington's disease. To confirm target engagement and exposure-occupancy relationships of clinical candidates for treatment, and to further explore the in vivo biology of PDE10A, non-invasive imaging using a specific PET ligand is warranted. Recently we have reported the in vivo evaluation of [(18)F]JNJ41510417 which showed specific binding to PDE10A in rat striatum, but with relatively slow kinetics. A chemically related derivative JNJ42259152 was found to have a similar in vivo occupancy, but lower lipophilicity and lower PDE10A in vitro inhibitory activity compared to JNJ41510417. (18)F-labeled JNJ42259152 was therefore evaluated as a potential PDE10A PET radiotracer. Baseline PET in rats and monkey showed specific retention in the PDE10A-rich striatum, and fast wash-out, with a good contrast to non-specific binding, in other brain regions. Pretreatment and chase experiments in rats with the selective PDE10A inhibitor MP-10 showed that tracer binding was specific and reversible. Absence of specific binding in PDE10A knock-out (KO) mice further confirmed PDE10A specificity. In vivo radiometabolite analysis using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) showed presence of polar radiometabolites in rat plasma and brain. In vivo imaging in rat and monkey further showed faster brain kinetics, and higher striatum-to-cerebellum ratios for [(18)F]JNJ42259152 compared to [(18)F]JNJ41510417. The arterial input function corrected for radiometabolites was determined in rats and basic kinetic modeling was established. For a 60-min acquisition time interval, striatal binding potential of the intact tracer referenced to the cerebellum showed good correlation with corresponding binding potential values of a Simplified Reference Tissue Model and referenced Logan Plot, the latter using a population averaged reference tissue-to-plasma clearance rate and offering the possibility to generate representative parametric binding potential images. In conclusion we can state that in vivo imaging in PDE10A KO mice, rats and monkey demonstrates that [(18)F]JNJ42259152 provides a PDE10A-specific signal in the striatum with good pharmacokinetic properties. Although presence of a polar radiometabolite in rat brain yielded a systematic but reproducible underestimation of the striatal BPND, a Logan reference tissue model approach using 60 min acquisition data is appropriate for quantification.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23664955/
"Modeling of Tracer Transport Delays for Improved Quantification of Regional Pulmonary ¹⁸F-FDG Kinetics, Vascular Transit Times, and Perfusion","Tyler J Wellman, Tilo Winkler, Marcos F Vidal Melo","¹⁸F-FDG-PET is increasingly used to assess pulmonary inflammatory cell activity. However, current models of pulmonary ¹⁸F-FDG kinetics do not account for delays in ¹⁸F-FDG transport between the plasma sampling site and the lungs. We developed a three-compartment model of ¹⁸F-FDG kinetics that includes a delay between the right heart and the local capillary blood pool, and used this model to estimate regional pulmonary perfusion. We acquired dynamic ¹⁸F-FDG scans in 12 mechanically ventilated sheep divided into control and lung injury groups (n = 6 each). The model was fit to tracer kinetics in three isogravitational regions-of-interest to estimate regional lung transport delays and regional perfusion. ¹³NN bolus infusion scans were acquired during a period of apnea to measure regional perfusion using an established reference method. The delayed input function model improved description of ¹⁸F-FDG kinetics (lower Akaike Information Criterion) in 98% of studied regions. Local transport delays ranged from 2.0 to 13.6 s, averaging 6.4 ± 2.9 s, and were highest in non-dependent regions. Estimates of regional perfusion derived from model parameters were highly correlated with perfusion measurements based on ¹³NN-PET (R² = 0.92, p < 0.001). By incorporating local vascular transports delays, this model of pulmonary ¹⁸F-FDG kinetics allows for simultaneous assessment of regional lung perfusion, transit times, and inflammation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25940652/
Tracer kinetics guided dynamic PET reconstruction,"Shan Tong, Pengcheng Shi","Dynamic PET reconstruction is a challenging issue due to the spatio-temporal nature and the complexity of the data. Conventional frame-by-frame approaches fail to explore the temporal information of dynamic PET data, and may lead to inaccurate results due to the low SNR of data. Due to the ill-conditioning of image reconstruction, proper prior knowledge should be incorporated to constrain the reconstruction. In this paper, we propose a tracer kinetics guided reconstruction framework for dynamic PET imaging. The dynamic reconstruction problem is formulated in a state-space representation, where compartment model serves as a continuous-time system equation to describe the tracer kinetic processes, and the imaging data is expressed as discrete sampling of the system states in a measurement equation. The reconstruction problem has therefore become a state estimation problem in a continuous-discrete hybrid paradigm, and sampled-data Hinfinity filtering is applied to for the estimation. As Hinfinity filtering makes no assumptions on the system and measurement statistics, robust reconstruction results can be obtained for dynamic PET imaging where the statistical properties of measurement data and system uncertainty are not available a priori.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17633718/
Generalization of endothelial modelling of TSPO PET imaging: Considerations on tracer affinities,"Gaia Rizzo, Mattia Veronese, Matteo Tonietto, Benedetta Bodini, Bruno Stankoff, Catriona Wimberley, Sonia Lavisse, Michel Bottlaender, Peter S Bloomfield, Oliver Howes, Paolo Zanotti-Fregonara, Federico E Turkheimer, Alessandra Bertoldo","The 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO) is a marker of microglia activation and the main target of positron emission tomography (PET) ligands for neuroinflammation. Previous works showed that accounting for TSPO endothelial binding improves PET quantification for [11C]PBR28, [18F]DPA714 and [11C]-R-PK11195. It is still unclear, however, whether the vascular signal is tracer-dependent. This work aims to explore the relationship between the TSPO vascular and tissue components for PET tracers with varying affinity, also assessing the impact of affinity towards the differentiability amongst kinetics and the ensuing ligand amenability to cluster analysis for the extraction of a reference region. First, we applied the compartmental model accounting for vascular binding to [11C]-R-PK11195 data from six healthy subjects. Then, we compared the [11C]-R-PK11195 vascular binding estimates with previously published values for [18F]DPA714 and [11C]PBR28. Finally, we determined the suitability for reference region extraction by calculating the angle between grey and white matter kinetics. Our results showed that endothelial binding is common to all TSPO tracers and proportional to their affinity. By consequence, grey and white matter kinetics were most similar for the radioligand with the highest affinity (i.e. [11C]PBR28), hence poorly suited for the extraction of a reference region using supervised clustering.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29135382/
Characterization of the serotonin 2A receptor selective PET tracer (R)-[18F]MH.MZ in the human brain,"Vasko Kramer, Agnete Dyssegaard, Jonathan Flores, Cristian Soza-Ried, Frank Rösch, Gitte Moos Knudsen, Horacio Amaral, Matthias M Herth","Purpose: The serotonin receptor subtype 2A antagonist (5-HT2AR) (R)-[18F]MH.MZ has in preclinical studies been identified as a promising PET imaging agent for quantification of cerebral 5-HT2ARs. It displays a very similar selectivity profile as [11C]MDL 100907, one of the most selective compounds identified thus far for the 5-HT2AR. As [11C]MDL 100907, (R)-[18F]MH.MZ also displays slow brain kinetics in various animal models; however, the half-life of fluorine-18 allows for long scan times and consequently, a more precise determination of 5-HT2AR binding could still be feasible. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the potential of (R)-[18F]MH.MZ PET to image and quantify the 5-HT2AR in the human brain in vivo.

Methods: Nine healthy volunteers underwent (R)-[18F]MH.MZ PET at baseline and four out of these also received a second PET scan, after ketanserin pretreatment. Regional time-activity curves of 17 brain regions were analyzed before and after pretreatment. We also investigated radiometabolism, time-dependent stability of outcomes measures, specificity of (R)-[18F]MH.MZ 5-HT2AR binding, and performance of different kinetic modeling approaches.

Results: Highest uptake was determined in 5-HT2AR rich regions with a BPNDof approximately 1.5 in cortex regions. No radiometabolism was observed. 1TCM and 2TCM resulted in similar outcome measure, whereas reference tissue models resulted in a small, but predictable bias. (R)-[18F]MH.MZ binding conformed to the known distribution of 5-HT2AR and could be blocked by pretreatment with ketanserin. Moreover, outcomes measures were stable after 100-110 min.

Conclusion: (R)-[18F]MH.MZ is a suitable PET tracer to image and quantify the 5-HT2AR system in humans. In comparison with [11C]MDL 100907, faster and more precise outcome measure could be obtained using (R)-[18F]MH.MZ. We believe that (R)-[18F]MH.MZ has the potential to become the antagonist radiotracer of choice to investigate the human 5-HT2AR system.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31606832/
Kinetic modeling and parametric imaging of 18 F-PSMA-11: An evaluation based on total-body dynamic positron emission tomography scans,"Hui Yuan, Guojin Zhang, Taotao Sun, Jingyun Ren, Qing Zhang, Zeyin Xiang, Entao Liu, Lei Jiang","Background: The prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) targeted positron-emitting tomography (PET) tracers are increasingly used in clinical practice, with novel tracers constantly being developed. Recently,18F-PSMA-11 has been gaining growing interest for several merits; however, direct in vivo visualization of its kinetic features in humans remains lacking.

Purpose: To visualize the kinetic features of18F-PSMA-11 in healthy subjects and patients with prostate cancer derived from the total-body dynamic PET scans.

Methods: A total of 8 healthy volunteers (7 males; 1 female) and 3 patients with prostate cancer underwent total-body PET/CT imaging at 1 and 2 h post injection (p.i.) of18F-PSMA-11, of which 7 healthy subjects and 3 patients underwent total-body dynamic PET scans lasting 30 min. Reversible two-tissue compartments (2TC) and Patlak models were fitted based on the voxel-based time activity curves (TACs), with the parametric images generated subsequently. Additionally, semi-automated segmentation of multiple organs was performed in the dynamic images to measure the SUVmean at different time points and in the parametric images to estimate the mean value of the kinetic parameters of these organs.

Results: 18F-PSMA-11 showed quick accumulation within prostate cancer, as early as 45 s after tracer injection. It was rapidly cleared from blood circulation and predominantly excreted through the urinary system. High and rapid radiotracer accumulation was observed in the liver, spleen, lacrimal glands, and salivary glands, whereas gradual accumulation was observed in the skeleton. Prostate cancer tissue is visualized in all parametric images, and best seen in DV and Patlak Ki images. Patlak Ki showed a good correlation with 2TC Kivalues (r = 0.858, p < 0.05) but less noise than 2TC images. A scanning time point of 30-35 min p.i. was then suggested for satisfactory tumor to background ratio.

Conclusion: Prostate cancer tissue is visible in most parametric images, and is better shown by Patlak Ki and 2TC DV images. Patlak Ki is consistent with, and thus is preferred over, 2TC Ki images for substantially quicker calculation. Based on the dynamic imaging analysis, a shorter uptake time (30-35 min) might be preferred for a better balance of tumor to background ratio.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38043120/
Impact of tissue kinetic heterogeneity on PET quantification: case study with the L-[1-11C]leucine PET method for cerebral protein synthesis rates,"Mattia Veronese, Alessandra Bertoldo, Giampaolo Tomasi, Carolyn Beebe Smith, Kathleen C Schmidt","Functional quantification with PET is generally based on modeling that assumes tissue regions are kinetically homogeneous. Even in regions sufficiently small to approach homogeneity, spillover due to resolution limitations of PET scanners may introduce heterogeneous kinetics into measured data. Herein we consider effects of kinetic heterogeneity at the smallest volume accessible, the single image voxel. We used L-[1-11C]leucine PET and compared rates of cerebral protein synthesis (rCPS) estimated voxelwise with methods that do (Spectral Analysis Iterative Filter, SAIF) and do not (Basis Function Method, BFM) allow for kinetic heterogeneity. In high resolution PET data with good counting statistics BFM produced estimates of rCPS comparable to SAIF, but at lower computational cost; thus the simpler, less costly method can be applied. With poorer counting statistics (lower injected radiotracer doses), BFM estimates were more biased. In data smoothed to simulate lower resolution PET, BFM produced estimates of rCPS 9-14% higher than SAIF, overestimation consistent with applying a homogeneous tissue model to kinetically heterogeneous data. Hence with lower resolution data it is necessary to account for kinetic heterogeneity in the analysis. Kinetic heterogeneity may impact analyses of other tracers and scanning protocols differently; assessments should be made on a case by case basis.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29343731/
Indirect methods for improving parameter estimation of PET kinetic models,"Hsuan-Ming Huang, Chih-Chieh Liu, Chieh Lin","Purpose: Parametric images obtained from kinetic modeling of dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) data provide a new way of visualizing quantitative parameters of the tracer kinetics. However, due to the high noise level in pixel-wise image-driven time-activity curves, parametric images often suffer from poor quality and accuracy. In this study, we propose an indirect parameter estimation framework which aims to improve the quality and quantitative accuracy of parametric images.

Methods: Three different approaches related to noise reduction and advanced curve fitting algorithm are used in the proposed framework. First, dynamic PET images are denoised using a kernel-based denoising method and the highly constrained backprojection technique. Second, gradient-free curve fitting algorithms are exploited to improve the accuracy and precision of parameter estimates. Third, a kernel-based post-filtering method is applied to parametric images to further improve the quality of parametric images. Computer simulations were performed to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework.

Results and conclusions: The simulation results showed that when compared to the Gaussian filtering, the proposed denoising method could provide better PET image quality, and consequentially improve the quality and quantitative accuracy of parametric images. In addition, gradient-free optimization algorithms (i.e., pattern search) can result in better parametric images than the gradient-based curve fitting algorithm (i.e., trust-region-reflective). Finally, our results showed that the proposed kernel-based post-filtering method could further improve the precision of parameter estimates while maintaining the accuracy of parameter estimates.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30762875/

A radioligand able to measure cardiac cholinergic activity would be an invaluable clinical and research tool since cholinergic dysfunction has been associated with a wide array of pathologies (e.g., chronic heart failure, myocardial infarction, arrythmias). [18F]Fluoroethoxybenzovesamicol (FEOBV) is a cholinergic radiotracer that has been extensively validated in the brain. Whether FEOBV PET can be used to assess cholinergic activity in the heart is not known. Hence, this study aimed to evaluate the properties of FEOBV for cardiac PET imaging and cholinergic activity mapping. PET data were collected for 40 minutes after injection of 230 ± 50 MBq of FEOBV in four healthy participants (1 female; Age: 37 ± 10; BMI: 25 ± 2). Dynamic LV time activity curves were fitted with Logan graphical, 1-tissue compartment, and 2-tissue compartment models, yielding similar distribution volume estimates for each participant.

To investigate the potential of a new (18)F-labeled pyridazinone analog ((18)F-BMS-747158-02), we characterized this tracer in a rat model of permanent and transient coronary occlusion using small-animal PET.

Methods: Myocardial (18)F-BMS-747158-02 distribution in healthy rats (n = 7), rats with transient (3-min) left coronary artery occlusion (n = 11), and rats with permanent left coronary occlusion (n = 11) was analyzed with a dedicated small-animal PET scanner.

Results: Normal hearts demonstrated intense and almost homogeneous tracer uptake throughout the left ventricle for more than 2 h. During permanent coronary occlusion, PET demonstrated perfusion defects, which remained unchanged (37.6% +/- 8.8%, 37.4% +/- 10.2%, and 36.2% +/- 9.8% left ventricle at 15, 45, and 115 min, respectively, after tracer injection). After transient ischemia, the induced defect size decreased significantly after reperfusion (16.2% +/- 9.3%, 6.0% +/- 6.5%, and 1.4% +/- 1.3% left ventricle). Tracer reinjection after transient ischemia resulted in normalization of the induced defect.

Conclusion: Coronary occlusion yielded distinct myocardial (18)F-BMS-747158-02 uptake defects in the area of ischemia, which demonstrated normalization of activity after reperfusion and reinjection. These promising kinetic parameters may allow for assessment of flow using exercise-rest protocols similar to those used in combination with exercise and rest perfusion SPECT.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18794259/
"Kinetics of the Tau PET Tracer 18F-AV-1451 (T807) in Subjects with Normal Cognitive Function, Mild Cognitive Impairment, and Alzheimer Disease","Sergey Shcherbinin, Adam J Schwarz, Abhinay Joshi, Michael Navitsky, Matthew Flitter, William R Shankle, Michael D Devous Sr, Mark A Mintun","We report kinetic modeling results of dynamic acquisition data from 0 to 100 min after injection with the tau PET tracer18F-AV-1451 in 19 subjects.

Methods: Subjects were clinically diagnosed as 4 young cognitively normal, 5 old cognitively normal, 5 mild cognitive impairment, and 5 Alzheimer disease (AD). Kinetic modeling was performed using Logan graphical analysis with the cerebellum crus as a reference region. Voxelwise binding potential ([Formula: see text]) and SUV ratio ([Formula: see text]) images were compared.

Results: In AD subjects, slower and spatially nonuniform clearance from cortical regions was observed as compared with the controls, which led to focal uptake and elevated retention in the imaging data from 80 to 100 min after injection. BP from the dynamic data from 0 to 100 min correlated strongly (R2> 0.86) with corresponding regional [Formula: see text] values. In the putamen, the observed kinetics (positive [Formula: see text] at the tracer delivery stage and plateauing time-SUVR curves for all diagnostic categories) may suggest either additional off-target binding or a second binding site with different kinetics.

Conclusion: The kinetics of the18F-AV-1451 tracer in cortical areas, as examined in this small group of subjects, differed by diagnostic stage. A delayed 80- to 100-min scan provided a reasonable substitute for a dynamic 0- to 100-min acquisition for cortical regions although other windows (e.g., 75-105 min) may be useful to evaluate.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27151986/
Kinetic modeling of 11C-SB207145 binding to 5-HT4 receptors in the human brain in vivo,"Lisbeth Marner, Nic Gillings, Robert A Comley, William F C Baaré, Eugenii A Rabiner, Alan A Wilson, Sylvain Houle, Steen G Hasselbalch, Claus Svarer, Roger N Gunn, Marc Laruelle, Gitte M Knudsen","The serotonin 4 receptor (5-HT(4) receptor) is known to be involved in learning and memory. We evaluated for the first time the quantification of a novel 5-HT(4) receptor radioligand, (11)C-SB207145, for in vivo brain imaging with PET in humans.

Methods: For evaluation of reproducibility, 6 subjects were scanned twice with (11)C-SB207145 on the same day. A further 2 subjects were scanned before and after blocking with the selective 5-HT(4) receptor inverse agonist piboserod (SB207266). Arterial blood samples were drawn for the calculation of metabolite-corrected arterial input functions. Regions of interest were delineated automatically on the individual's MR images coregistered to the PET images, and regional time-activity curves were extracted. Quantitative tracer kinetic modeling was investigated with 1- and 2-tissue-compartment models using plasma input functions and the simplified reference tissue model (SRTM).

Results: (11)C-SB207145 readily entered the brain and showed a distribution consistent with the known localization of the 5-HT(4) receptor. Using plasma input models, the time-activity data were well described by the 2-tissue-compartment model in all regions and allowed for the estimate of binding potentials relative to the reference region (BP(ND): striatum, 3.38 +/- 0.72; hippocampus, 0.82 +/- 0.19; parietal cortex, 0.30 +/- 0.08). Quantification with the 1-tissue-compartment model, 2-tissue-compartment model, and SRTM were associated with good test-retest reproducibility and time stability. However, the SRTM-generated BP(ND) values in the striatum were underestimated by 20%-43% in comparison to the 2-tissue-compartment model. The blocking study with piboserod confirmed that the radioligand was selective for the 5-HT(4) receptor, that the cerebellum was a suitable reference region devoid of specific binding, and that nonspecific binding was constant across brain regions.

Conclusion: In vivo imaging of cerebral 5-HT(4) receptors can be determined reliably using (11)C-207145 PET with arterial input in humans. SRTM showed high reproducibility and reliability but bias in the striatum, and therefore, the use of SRTM should be considered carefully for individual applications.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19470850/
A kinetic model for dynamic [18F]-Fmiso PET data to analyse tumour hypoxia,"Daniela Thorwarth, Susanne M Eschmann, Frank Paulsen, Markus Alber","A method is presented to identify and quantify hypoxia in human head-and-neck tumours based on dynamic [18F]-Fmiso PET patient data, using a model for the tracer transport. A compartmental model was developed, inspired by recent immunohistochemical investigations with the tracer pimonidazole. In order to take the trapping of the tracer and the diffusion in interstitial space into account, the kinetic model consists of two compartments and a specific input function. This voxel-based data analysis allows us to decompose the time-activity curves (TACs) into their perfusion, diffusion and hypoxia-induced retention components. This characterization ranges from well perfused tumours over diffusion limited hypoxia to strong hypoxia and necrosis. The overall shape of the TAC and the model parameters may point at the structural architecture of the tissue sample. The model addresses the two main problems associated with hypoxia imaging with PET. Firstly, the hypoxic areas are spatially separated from well perfused vessels, causing long diffusion times of the tracer. Secondly, tracer uptake occurs only in viable hypoxic cells, which constitute only a small subpopulation in the presence of necrosis. The resulting parameters such as the concentration of hypoxic cells and the perfusion are displayed in parameter plots ('hypoxia map'). Quantification of hypoxia performed with the presented kinetic model is more reliable than a criterion based on static standardized uptake values (SUV) at an early timepoint, because severely hypoxic/necrotic tissues show low uptake and are thus overlooked by SUV threshold identification. The derived independent measures for perfusion and hypoxia may provide a basis for individually adapted treatment planning.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15876662/
Distribution of LAT1-targeting PET tracer was independent of the tumor blood flow in rat xenograft models of C6 glioma and MIA PaCa-2,"Masanao Aoki, Tadashi Watabe, Shushi Nagamori, Sadahiro Naka, Hayato Ikeda, Pornparn Kongpracha, Genki Horitsugi, Yasukazu Kanai, Eku Shimosegawa, Yoshikatsu Kanai, Jun Hatazawa","Objective: L-type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1) is strongly expressed on the cell membrane in various types of human cancer cells, while being minimally expressed in normal or inflammatory tissues. Therefore, LAT1-targeting PET tracers have been developed for cancer-specific imaging. The purpose of this study was to study the distribution of two LAT1-targeting PET tracers, L-4-borono-2-18F-fluoro-phenylalanine (18F-FBPA) and L-3-18F-alpha-methyl tyrosine (18F-FAMT), in relation to the tumor blood flow, using rat xenograft models.

Methods: Rat tumor xenograft models of C6 glioma (n = 4; tumors = 8) and MIA PaCa-2 (pancreatic cancer) (n = 4; tumors = 6) were used. The expressions of LAT1 and CD98hc were evaluated by both immunofluorescence staining and western blot analysis. Dynamic PET was performed after injection of18F-FAMT or18F-FBPA (scan duration = 70 min) following15O-water PET (scan duration = 10 min). The PET data were subjected to kinetic analyses, and the K1, k2, and total distribution volume (Vt) were calculated using the one-tissue compartment model. The accumulation of the LAT1 tracers was expressed in terms of their Vt. Tumor blood flow (TBF) was represented by the K1value in15O-water PET.

Results: LAT1/CD98hc expression was confirmed in both xenografts by immunofluorescence staining. Western blot analysis showed higher functional expression of LAT1 in the C6 glioma cells as compared to the MIA PaCa-2 cells (C6 glioma/MIA PaCa-2 relative expression ratio = 1.70). The Vtvalues of both18F-FBPA and18F-FAMT were significantly higher in the C6 glioma xenografts than in the MIA PaCa-2 xenografts (C6 glioma: 2.27 ± 0.35 and 2.03 ± 0.23, respectively; MIA PaCa-2: 1.28 ± 0.26 and 1.35 ± 0.15, respectively). Meanwhile, there was no significant correlation of the Vtvalue of either18F-FBPA or18F-FAMT with the TBF, in either the C6 glioma or the MIA PaCa-2 xenografts.

Conclusions: This study revealed that total distribution volumes of the LAT1-targeting PET tracers18F-FBPA and18F-FAMT were independent of the tumor blood flow and might reflect the functional expression levels of LAT1 in the C6 glioma and MIA PaCa-2 xenograft models.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30820863/
Kinetic analysis of 2-[11C]thymidine PET imaging studies of malignant brain tumors: preliminary patient results,"Joanne M Wells, David A Mankoff, Janet F Eary, Alexander M Spence, Mark Muzi, Finbarr O'Sullivan, Cheryl B Vernon, Jeanne M Link, Kenneth A Krohn","2-[11C]Thymidine (TdR), a PET tracer for cellular proliferation, may be advantageous for monitoring brain tumor progression and response to therapy. Kinetic analysis of dynamic TdR images was performed to estimate the rate of thymidine transport (K1t) and thymidine flux (KTdR) into brain tumors and normal brain. These estimates were compared to MRI and pathologic results.

Methods: Twenty patients underwent sequential [11C]CO2 (major TdR metabolite) and TdR PET studies with arterial blood sampling and metabolite analysis. The data were fitted using the five-compartment model described in the companion article.

Results: Comparison of model estimates with clinical and pathologic data shows that K1t is higher for MRI contrast enhancing tumors (p < .001), and KTdR increases with tumor grade (p < .02). On average, TdR retention was lower after treatment in high-grade tumors. The model was able to distinguish between increased thymidine transport due to blood-brain barrier breakdown and increased tracer retention associated with tumor cell proliferation.

Conclusion: Initial analysis of model estimates of thymidine retention and transport show good agreement with the clinical and pathological features of a wide range of brain tumors. Ongoing studies will evaluate its role in measuring response to treatment and predicting outcome.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12920852/
Quantification of 11C-PIB kinetics in cardiac amyloidosis,"Tanja Kero, Jens Sörensen, Gunnar Antoni, Helena Wilking, Kristina Carlson, Ola Vedin, Sara Rosengren, Gerhard Wikström, Mark Lubberink","Background: The purpose of this work was to determine the optimal tracer kinetic model of11C-PIB and to validate the use of the simplified methods retention index (RI) and standardized uptake value (SUV) for quantification of cardiac11C-PIB uptake in amyloidosis.

Methods and results: Single-tissue, reversible and irreversible two-tissue models were fitted to data from seven cardiac amyloidosis patients who underwent11C-PIB PET scans and arterial blood sampling for measurement of blood radioactivity and metabolites. The irreversible two-tissue model (2Tirr) best described cardiac11C-PIB uptake. RI and SUV showed high correlation with the rate of irreversible binding (Ki) from the 2Tirr model (r2=0.95 and r2=0.94).

Compartment modeling of dynamic brain PET--the impact of scatter corrections on parameter errors,"Ida Häggström, C Ross Schmidtlein, Mikael Karlsson, Anne Larsson","Purpose: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of scatter and its correction on kinetic parameters in dynamic brain positron emission tomography (PET) tumor imaging. The 2-tissue compartment model was used, and two different reconstruction methods and two scatter correction (SC) schemes were investigated.

Methods: The gate Monte Carlo (MC) software was used to perform 2 × 15 full PET scan simulations of a voxelized head phantom with inserted tumor regions. The two sets of kinetic parameters of all tissues were chosen to represent the 2-tissue compartment model for the tracer 3'-deoxy-3'-((18)F)fluorothymidine (FLT), and were denoted FLT1 and FLT2. PET data were reconstructed with both 3D filtered back-projection with reprojection (3DRP) and 3D ordered-subset expectation maximization (OSEM). Images including true coincidences with attenuation correction (AC) and true+scattered coincidences with AC and with and without one of two applied SC schemes were reconstructed. Kinetic parameters were estimated by weighted nonlinear least squares fitting of image derived time-activity curves. Calculated parameters were compared to the true input to the MC simulations.

Results: The relative parameter biases for scatter-eliminated data were 15%, 16%, 4%, 30%, 9%, and 7% (FLT1) and 13%, 6%, 1%, 46%, 12%, and 8% (FLT2) for K1, k2, k3, k4, Va, and Ki, respectively. As expected, SC was essential for most parameters since omitting it increased biases by 10 percentage points on average. SC was not found necessary for the estimation of Ki and k3, however. There was no significant difference in parameter biases between the two investigated SC schemes or from parameter biases from scatter-eliminated PET data. Furthermore, neither 3DRP nor OSEM yielded the smallest parameter biases consistently although there was a slight favor for 3DRP which produced less biased k3 and Ki estimates while OSEM resulted in a less biased Va. The uncertainty in OSEM parameters was about 26% (FLT1) and 12% (FLT2) larger than for 3DRP although identical postfilters were applied.

Conclusions: SC was important for good parameter estimations. Both investigated SC schemes performed equally well on average and properly corrected for the scattered radiation, without introducing further bias. Furthermore, 3DRP was slightly favorable over OSEM in terms of kinetic parameter biases and SDs.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25370640/

Requirements and implementation of a flexible kinetic modeling tool,"C Burger, A Buck","Kinetic (or compartment) modeling is a highly versatile tool for the analysis of experiments within living systems. In PET, it is essential for developing tracers, for assessing tracer behavior and for extracting quantitative information about the target process. However, tools to support the modeling tasks involved are not easily available.

Methods: This article presents a requirements analysis for kinetic modeling in PET. The interactive kinetic modeling tool KMZ implements many of these features. It facilitates model development by a set of predefined models and by the ease of introducing new models. Monte Carlo studies allow assessing parameter identifiability. The responses in the different compartments as well as the expected time-activity curve can be simulated for specific model configurations. For measured time-activity curves, model optimization can be performed by the Powell or the Marquardt algorithm. Both support weighted nonlinear least-squares fitting and allow optional constraints of parameter ranges. To further improve parameter estimation, the fitting of several regional time-activity curves can be coupled, resulting in lower standard errors for parameters common among regions. It is possible to highly automate the evaluation of study series and to forward the results into statistical analysis tools.

Results: The KMZ tool has proven highly suitable in evaluating data from different types of studies, and the intuitive user interface enables medical doctors to successfully perform routine evaluations after a short training period.

Conclusion: A portable kinetic modeling tool with the described features would provide easy access to model development and may help consolidate kinetic modeling in clinical settings for well-defined applications.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9374364/
Kinetic modelling of [123I]CNS 1261--a potential SPET tracer for the NMDA receptor,"Kjell Erlandsson, Rodrigo A Bressan, Rachel S Mulligan, Roger N Gunn, Vincent J Cunningham, Jonathan Owens, David Wyper, Peter J Ell, Lyn S Pilowsky",N-(1-napthyl)-N'-(3-[(123)I]-iodophenyl)-N-methylguanidine ([(123)I]CNS 1261) is a novel SPET ligand developed for imaging the NMDA receptor intra-channel MK 801/PCP/ketamine site.

Non-invasive quantification of 18F-florbetaben with total-body EXPLORER PET,"Emily Nicole Holy, Elizabeth Li, Anjan Bhattarai, Evan Fletcher, Evelyn R Alfaro, Danielle J Harvey, Benjamin A Spencer, Simon R Cherry, Charles S DeCarli, Audrey P Fan","Background: Kinetic modeling of18F-florbetaben provides important quantification of brain amyloid deposition in research and clinical settings but its use is limited by the requirement of arterial blood data for quantitative PET. The total-body EXPLORER PET scanner supports the dynamic acquisition of a full human body simultaneously and permits noninvasive image-derived input functions (IDIFs) as an alternative to arterial blood sampling. This study quantified brain amyloid burden with kinetic modeling, leveraging dynamic18F-florbetaben PET in aorta IDIFs and the brain in an elderly cohort.

Methods: 18F-florbetaben dynamic PET imaging was performed on the EXPLORER system with tracer injection (300 MBq) in 3 individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD), 3 with mild cognitive impairment, and 9 healthy controls. Image-derived input functions were extracted from the descending aorta with manual regions of interest based on the first 30 s after injection. Dynamic time-activity curves (TACs) for 110 min were fitted to the two-tissue compartment model (2TCM) using population-based metabolite corrected IDIFs to calculate total and specific distribution volumes (VT, Vs) in key brain regions with early amyloid accumulation. Non-displaceable binding potential ([Formula: see text] was also calculated from the multi-reference tissue model (MRTM).

Results: Amyloid-positive (AD) patients showed the highest VTand VSin anterior cingulate, posterior cingulate, and precuneus, consistent with [Formula: see text] analysis. [Formula: see text]and VTfrom kinetic models were correlated (r² = 0.46, P < 2[Formula: see text] with a stronger positive correlation observed in amyloid-positive participants, indicating reliable model fits with the IDIFs.

Kinetic analysis of dynamic 18F-fluoromisonidazole PET correlates with radiation treatment outcome in head-and-neck cancer,"Daniela Thorwarth, Susanne-Martina Eschmann, Jutta Scheiderbauer, Frank Paulsen, Markus Alber","Background: Hypoxia compromises local control in patients with head-and-neck cancer (HNC). In order to determine the value of [18F]-fluoromisonidazole (Fmiso) with regard to tumor hypoxia, a patient study with dynamic Fmiso PET was performed. For a better understanding of tracer uptake and distribution, a kinetic model was developed to analyze dynamic Fmiso PET data.

Methods: For 15 HNC patients, dynamic Fmiso PET examinations were performed prior to radiotherapy (RT) treatment. The data was analyzed using a two compartment model, which allows the determination of characteristic hypoxia and perfusion values. For different parameters, such as patient age, tumor size and standardized uptake value, the correlation to treatment outcome was tested using the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney U-test. Statistical tests were also performed for hypoxia and perfusion parameters determined by the kinetic model and for two different metrics based on these parameters.

Results: The kinetic Fmiso analysis extracts local hypoxia and perfusion characteristics of a tumor tissue. These parameters are independent quantities. In this study, different types of characteristic hypoxia-perfusion patterns in tumors could be identified. The clinical verification of the results, obtained on the basis of the kinetic analysis, showed a high correlation of hypoxia-perfusion patterns and RT treatment outcome (p = 0.001) for this initial patient group.

Conclusion: The presented study established, that Fmiso PET scans may benefit from dynamic acquisition and analysis by a kinetic model. The pattern of distribution of perfusion and hypoxia in the tissue is correlated to local control in HNC.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16321146/
An introduction to PET and SPECT neuroreceptor quantification models,"M Ichise, J H Meyer, Y Yonekura","PET and SPECT using appropriate radioligands allow imaging of certain critical components of neurotransmission such as presynaptic transporters and postsynaptic receptors in living human brains. PET and SPECT data are commonly analyzed by applying tracer kinetic models. These modeling approaches assume a compartmental system and derive the outcome measure called the binding potential, which reflects the densities of transporters or receptors in a brain region of interest.

Kinetic and Static Analysis of Poly-(Adenosine Diphosphate-Ribose) Polymerase-1-Targeted 18F-Fluorthanatrace PET Images of Ovarian Cancer,"Anthony J Young, Austin R Pantel, Varsha Viswanath, Tiffany L Dominguez, Mehran Makvandi, Hsiaoju Lee, Shihong Li, Erin K Schubert, Daniel A Pryma, Michael D Farwell, Robert H Mach, Fiona Simpkins, Lilie L Lin, David A Mankoff, Robert K Doot","The poly-(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP) family of proteins participates in numerous functions, most notably the DNA damage response. Cancer vulnerability to DNA damage has led to development of several PARP inhibitors (PARPi). This class of drugs has demonstrated therapeutic efficacy in ovarian, breast, and prostate cancers, but with variable response. Consequently, clinics need to select patients likely to benefit from these targeted therapies. In vivo imaging of18F-fluorthanatrace uptake has been shown to correspond to PARP-1 expression in tissue. This study characterized the pharmacokinetics of18F-fluorthanatrace and tested kinetic and static models to guide metric selection in future studies assessing18F-fluorthanatrace as a biomarker of response to PARPi therapy.Methods:Fourteen prospectively enrolled ovarian cancer patients were injected with18F-fluorthanatrace and imaged dynamically for 60 min after injection followed by up to 2 whole-body scans, with venous blood activity and metabolite measurements. SUVmaxand SUVpeakwere extracted from dynamic images and whole-body scans. Kinetic parameter estimates and SUVs were assessed for correlations with tissue PARP-1 immunofluorescence (n= 7). Simulations of population kinetic parameters enabled estimation of measurement bias and precision in parameter estimates.Results:18F-fluorthanatrace blood clearance was variable, but labeled metabolite profiles were similar across patients, supporting use of a population parent fraction curve. The total distribution volume from a reversible 2-tissue-compartment model and Logan reference tissue distribution volume ratio (DVR) from the first hour of PET acquisition correlated with tumor PARP-1 expression by immunofluorescence (r= 0.76 and 0.83, respectively;P< 0.05). DVR bias and precision estimates were 6.4% and 29.1%, respectively. SUVmaxand SUVpeakacquired from images with midpoints of 57.5, 110 ± 3, and 199 ± 4 min highly correlated with PARP-1 expression (mean ± SD,r≥ 0.79;P< 0.05).Conclusion:Tumor SUVmaxand SUVpeakat 55-60 min after injection and later and DVR from at least 60 min appear to be robust noninvasive measures of PARP-1 binding.18F-fluorthanatrace uptake in ovarian cancer was best described by models of reversible binding.

VOXEL-LEVEL MAPPING OF TRACER KINETICS IN PET STUDIES: A STATISTICAL APPROACH EMPHASIZING TISSUE LIFE TABLES,"Finbarr O'Sullivan, Mark Muzi, David A Mankoff, Janet F Eary, Alexander M Spence, Kenneth A Krohn","Most radiotracers used in dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) scanning act in a linear time-invariant fashion so that the measured time-course data are a convolution between the time course of the tracer in the arterial supply and the local tissue impulse response, known as the tissue residue function. In statistical terms the residue is a life table for the transit time of injected radiotracer atoms. The residue provides a description of the tracer kinetic information measurable by a dynamic PET scan. Decomposition of the residue function allows separation of rapid vascular kinetics from slower blood-tissue exchanges and tissue retention. For voxel-level analysis, we propose that residues be modeled by mixtures of nonparametrically derived basis residues obtained by segmentation of the full data volume. Spatial and temporal aspects of diagnostics associated with voxel-level model fitting are emphasized. Illustrative examples, some involving cancer imaging studies, are presented. Data from cerebral PET scanning with18F fluoro-deoxyglucose (FDG) and15O water (H2O) in normal subjects is used to evaluate the approach. Cross-validation is used to make regional comparisons between residues estimated using adaptive mixture models with more conventional compartmental modeling techniques. Simulations studies are used to theoretically examine mean square error performance and to explore the benefit of voxel-level analysis when the primary interest is a statistical summary of regional kinetics. The work highlights the contribution that multivariate analysis tools and life-table concepts can make in the recovery of local metabolic information from dynamic PET studies, particularly ones in which the assumptions of compartmental-like models, with residues that are sums of exponentials, might not be certain.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25392718/
Quantification of cardiac sympathetic nerve density with N-11C-guanyl-meta-octopamine and tracer kinetic analysis,"David M Raffel, Robert A Koeppe, Yong-Woon Jung, Guie Gu, Keun Sam Jang, Phillip S Sherman, Carole A Quesada","Most cardiac sympathetic nerve radiotracers are substrates of the norepinephrine transporter (NET). Existing tracers such as (123)I-metaiodobenzylguanidine ((123)I-MIBG) and (11)C-(-)-meta-hydroxyephedrine ((11)C-HED) are flow-limited tracers because of their rapid NET transport rates. This prevents successful application of kinetic analysis techniques and causes semiquantitative measures of tracer retention to be insensitive to mild-to-moderate nerve losses. N-(11)C-guanyl-(-)-meta-octopamine ((11)C-GMO) has a much slower NET transport rate and is trapped in storage vesicles. The goal of this study was to determine whether analyses of (11)C-GMO kinetics could provide robust and sensitive measures of regional cardiac sympathetic nerve densities.

Methods: PET studies were performed in a rhesus macaque monkey under control conditions or after intravenous infusion of the NET inhibitor desipramine (DMI). Five desipramine dose levels were used to establish a range of available cardiac NET levels. Compartmental modeling of (11)C-GMO kinetics yielded estimates of the rate constants K1 (mL/min/g), k2 (min(-1)), and k3 (min(-1)). These values were used to calculate a net uptake rate constant K(i) (mL/min/g) = (K1k3)/(k2 + k3). In addition, Patlak graphical analyses of (11)C-GMO kinetics yielded Patlak slopes K(p) (mL/min/g), which represent alternative measurements of the net uptake rate constant K(i). (11)C-GMO kinetics in isolated rat hearts were also measured for comparison with other tracers.

Results: In isolated rat hearts, the neuronal uptake rate of (11)C-GMO was 8 times slower than (11)C-HED and 12 times slower than (11)C-MIBG. (11)C-GMO also had a long neuronal retention time (>200 h). Compartmental modeling of (11)C-GMO kinetics in the monkey heart proved stable under all conditions. Calculated net uptake rate constants K(i) tracked desipramine-induced reductions of available NET in a dose-dependent manner, with a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.087 ± 0.012 mg of desipramine per kilogram. Patlak analysis provided highly linear Patlak plots, and the Patlak slopes Kp also declined in a dose-dependent manner (IC50 = 0.068 ± 0.010 mg of desipramine per kilogram).

Conclusion: Compartmental modeling and Patlak analysis of (11)C-GMO kinetics each provided quantitative parameters that accurately tracked changes in cardiac NET levels. These results strongly suggest that PET studies with (11)C-GMO can provide robust and sensitive quantitative measures of regional cardiac sympathetic nerve densities in human hearts.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23886728/
Kinetic analysis of the metabotropic glutamate subtype 5 tracer [(18)F]FPEB in bolus and bolus-plus-constant-infusion studies in humans,"Jenna M Sullivan, Keunpoong Lim, David Labaree, Shu-Fei Lin, Timothy J McCarthy, John P Seibyl, Gilles Tamagnan, Yiyun Huang, Richard E Carson, Yu-Shin Ding, Evan D Morris","[(18)F]FPEB is a positron emission tomography tracer which, in preclinical studies, has shown high specificity and selectivity toward the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5).

Positron emission tomography compartmental models: a basis pursuit strategy for kinetic modeling,"Roger N Gunn, Steve R Gunn, Federico E Turkheimer, John A D Aston, Vincent J Cunningham","A kinetic modeling approach for the quantification of in vivo tracer studies with dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) is presented. The approach is based on a general compartmental description of the tracer's fate in vivo and determines a parsimonious model consistent with the measured data. The technique involves the determination of a sparse selection of kinetic basis functions from an overcomplete dictionary using the method of basis pursuit denoising. This enables the characterization of the systems impulse response function from which values of the systems macro parameters can be estimated. These parameter estimates can be obtained from a region of interest analysis or as parametric images from a voxel-based analysis. In addition, model order estimates are returned that correspond to the number of compartments in the estimated compartmental model. Validation studies evaluate the methods performance against two preexisting data led techniques, namely, graphical analysis and spectral analysis. Application of this technique to measured PET data is demonstrated using [11C]diprenorphine (opiate receptor) and [11C]WAY-100635 (5-HT1A receptor). Although the method is presented in the context of PET neuroreceptor binding studies, it has general applicability to the quantification of PET/SPECT radiotracer studies in neurology, oncology, and cardiology.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12468888/
Assessment of myocardial perfusion by positron emission tomography,"M Schwaiger, O Muzik","Positron emission tomography (PET) represents an advanced imaging technology for the noninvasive evaluation of regional myocardial blood flow. Several blood flow tracers are available, including cyclotron-produced radiopharmaceuticals such as [15O]H2O and [13N]NH3 and generator-produced rubidium-82 ([82Rb]-) and copper-62 ([62Cu]-) pyruvaldehyde-bis-(N-4-methylthiosemicarbazone) (PTSM). 82Rb and [13N]NH3 are the most commonly employed tracers for the qualitative evaluation of regional myocardial perfusion. Their use allows the accurate detection of coronary artery disease in combination with pharmacologic stress. Initial comparative studies with thallium-201 (201Tl) single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) have shown that PET has a higher diagnostic accuracy. Beyond improved diagnostic performance, the quantitative flow measurements provided by PET represent an important advance in nuclear cardiology. The radiopharmaceuticals [15O]H2O and [13N]NH3 have been applied for the noninvasive determination of regional coronary reserve. Quantification of blood flow based on tracer kinetic modeling yields blood flow values in close agreement with determinations provided by invasive procedures. The noninvasive quantification of blood flow provides a useful research and clinical tool for the objective assessment of therapeutic interventions as well as pathophysiologic alterations of regional myocardial blood flow in various cardiac diseases.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2035433/
18F-Fluciclovine PET Imaging of Glutaminase Inhibition in Breast Cancer Models,"Rong Zhou, Hoon Choi, Jianbo Cao, Austin Pantel, Mamta Gupta, Hsiaoju S Lee, David Mankoff","Aggressive cancers such as triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) avidly metabolize glutamine as a feature of their malignant phenotype. The conversion of glutamine to glutamate by the glutaminase enzyme represents the first and rate-limiting step of this pathway and a target for drug development. Indeed, a novel glutaminase inhibitor (GLSi) has been developed and tested in clinical trials but with limited success, suggesting the potential for a biomarker to select patients who could benefit from this novel therapy. Here, we studied a nonmetabolized amino acid analog,18F-fluciclovine, as a PET imaging biomarker for detecting the pharmacodynamic response to GLSi.Methods:Uptake of18F-fluciclovine into human breast cancer cells was studied in the presence and absence of inhibitors of glutamine transporters and GLSi. To allow18F-fluciclovine PET to be performed on mice, citrate in the tracer formulation is replaced by phosphate-buffered saline. Mice bearing triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) xenografts (HCC38, HCC1806, and MBA-MD-231) and estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer xenografts (MCF-7) were imaged with dynamic PET at baseline and after a 2-d treatment of GLSi (CB839) or vehicle. Kinetic analysis suggested reversible uptake of the tracer, and the distribution volume (VD) of18F-fluciclovine was estimated by Logan plot analysis.Results:Our data showed that cellular uptake of18F-fluciclovine is mediated by glutamine transporters. A significant increase in VDwas observed after CB839 treatment in TNBC models exhibiting high glutaminase activity (HCC38 and HCC1806) but not in TNBC or MCF-7 exhibiting low glutaminase. Changes in VDwere corroborated with changes in GLS activity measured in tumors treated with CB839 versus vehicle, as well as with changes in VDof18F-(2S,R4)-fluoroglutamine, which we previously validated as a measure of cellular glutamine pool size. A moderate, albeit significant, decrease in18F-FDG PET signal was observed in HCC1806 tumors after CB839 treatment.Conclusion:18F-fluciclovine PET has potential to serve as a clinically translatable pharmacodynamic biomarker of GLSi.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35772960/
Quantitative assessment of translocator protein (TSPO) in the non-human primate brain and clinical translation of [18F]LW223 as a TSPO-targeted PET radioligand,"Zhiqiang Tan, Achi Haider, Shaojuan Zhang, Jiahui Chen, Junjie Wei, Kai Liao, Guocong Li, Huiyi Wei, Chenchen Dong, Wenqing Ran, Ying Li, Yuefeng Li, Jian Rong, Yinlong Li, Steven H Liang, Hao Xu, Lu Wang","Objectives: Translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO) positron emission tomography (PET) can be harnessed for the non-invasive detection of macrophage-driven inflammation. [18F]LW223, a newly reported TSPO PET tracer which was insensitive to rs6971 polymorphism, showed favorable performance characteristics in a recent imaging study involving a rat myocardial infarction model. To enable quantitative neuroimaging with [18F]LW223, we conducted kinetic analysis in the non-human primate (NHP) brain. Further, we sought to assess the utility of [18F]LW223-based TSPO imaging in a first-in-human study.

Methods: Radiosynthesis of [18F]LW223 was accomplished on an automated module, whereas molar activities, stability in formulation, lipophilicity and unbound free fraction (fu) of the probe were measured. Brain penetration and target specificity of [18F]LW223 in NHPs were corroborated by PET-MR imaging under baseline and pre-blocking conditions using the validated TSPO inhibitor, (R)-PK11195, at doses ranging from 5 to 10 mg/kg. Kinetic modeling was performed using one-tissue compartment model (1TCM), two-tissue compartment model (2TCM) and Logan graphical analyses, using dynamic PET data acquisition, arterial blood collection and metabolic stability testing. Clinical PET scans were performed in two healthy volunteers (HVs). Regional brain standard uptake value ratio (SUVr) was assessed for different time intervals.

Results: [18F]LW223 was synthesized in non-decay corrected radiochemical yields (n.d.c. RCYs) of 33.3 ± 6.5% with molar activities ranging from 1.8 ± 0.7 Ci/µmol (n = 11). [18F]LW223 was stable in formulation for up to 4 h and LogD7.4of 2.31 ± 0.13 (n = 6) and fuof 5.80 ± 1.42% (n = 6) were determined. [18F]LW223 exhibited good brain penetration in NHPs, with a peak SUV value of ca. 1.79 in the whole brain. Pre-treatment with (R)-PK11195 substantially accelerated the washout and attenuated the area under the time-activity curve, indicating in vivo specificity of [18F]LW223 towards TSPO. Kinetic modeling demonstrated that 2TCM was the most suitable model for [18F]LW223-based neuroimaging. Global transfer rate constants (K1) and total volumes of distribution (VT) were found to be 0.10 ± 0.01 mL/cm3/min and 2.30 ± 0.17 mL/cm3, respectively. Dynamic PET data analyses across distinct time windows revealed that the VTvalues were relatively stable after 60 min post-injection. In a preliminary clinical study with two healthy volunteers, [18F]LW223 exhibited good brain uptake and considerable tracer retention across all analyzed brain regions. Of note, an excellent correlation between SUVr with VTwas obtained when assessing the time interval from 20 to 40 min post tracer injection (SUVr(20-40 min), R2= 0.94, p < 0.0001), suggesting this time window may be suitable to estimate specific binding to TSPO in human brain.

Conclusion: Our findings indicate that [18F]LW223 is suitable for quantitative TSPO-targeted PET imaging in higher species. Employing state-of-the-art kinetic modeling, we found that [18F]LW223 was effective in mapping TSPO throughout the NHP brain, with best model fits obtained from 2TCM and Logan graphical analyses. Overall, our results indicate that [18F]LW223 exhibits favorable tracer performance characteristics in higher species, and this novel imaging tool may hold promise to provide effective neuroinflammation imaging in patients with neurological disease.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36746361/
Rapid dual-tracer PTSM+ATSM PET imaging of tumour blood flow and hypoxia: a simulation study,"T C Rust, D J Kadrmas","Blood flow and hypoxia are interrelated aspects of physiology that affect cancer treatment and response. Cu-PTSM and Cu-ATSM are related PET tracers for blood flow and hypoxia, and the ability to rapidly image both tracers in a single scan would bring several advantages over conventional single-tracer techniques. Using dynamic imaging with staggered injections, overlapping signals for multiple PET tracers may be recovered utilizing information from kinetics and radioactive decay. In this work, rapid dual-tracer PTSM+ATSM PET was simulated and tested as a function of injection delay, order and relative dose for several copper isotopes, and the results were compared relative to separate single-tracer data. Time-activity curves representing a broad range of tumour blood flow and hypoxia levels were simulated, and parallel dual-tracer compartment modelling was used to recover the signals for each tracer. The main results were tested further using a torso phantom simulation of PET tumour imaging. Using scans as short as 30 minutes, the dual-tracer method provided measures of blood flow and hypoxia similar to single-tracer imaging. The best performance was obtained by injecting PTSM first and using a somewhat higher dose for ATSM. Comparable results for different copper isotopes suggest that tracer kinetics with staggered injections play a more important role than radioactive decay in the signal separation process. Rapid PTSM+ATSM PET has excellent potential for characterizing both tumour blood flow and hypoxia in a single, fast scan, provided that technological hurdles related to algorithm development and routine use can be overcome.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16357431/
Robust nonlinear parameter estimation in tracer kinetic analysis using infinity norm regularization and particle swarm optimization,"Seung Kwan Kang, Seongho Seo, Chul-Hee Lee, Mi Jeong Kim, Su Jin Kim, Jae Sung Lee","In positron emission tomography (PET) studies, the voxel-wise calculation of individual rate constants describing the tracer kinetics is quite challenging because of the nonlinear relationship between the rate constants and PET data and the high noise level in voxel data. Based on preliminary simulations using a standard two-tissue compartment model, we can hypothesize that it is possible to reduce errors in the rate constant estimates when constraining the overestimation of the larger of two exponents in the model equation. We thus propose a novel approach based on infinity-norm regularization for limiting this exponent. Owing to the non-smooth cost function of this regularization scheme, which prevents the use of conventional Jacobian-based optimization methods, we examined a proximal gradient algorithm and the particle swarm optimization (PSO) through a simulation study. Because it exploits multiple initial values, the PSO method shows much better convergence than the proximal gradient algorithm, which is susceptible to the initial values. In the implementation of PSO, the use of a Gamma distribution to govern random movements was shown to improve the convergence rate and stability compared to a uniform distribution. Consequently, Gamma-based PSO with regularization was shown to outperform all other methods tested, including the conventional basis function method and Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, in terms of its statistical properties.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32200299/
Kinetic modeling of 52Fe/52mMn-citrate at the blood-brain barrier by positron emission tomography,"C Calonder, P I Würtenberger, R P Maguire, R Pellikka, K L Leenders","The kinetics of iron at the blood-brain barrier of the monkey were studied in vivo using positron emission tomography (PET) and the tracer 52Fe/52mMn-citrate. 52mMn is the beta(+)-emitting daughter nuclide of 52Fe and therefore contributes to the observed signal and background in the PET images and may influence the quantification of physiological relevant iron parameters. The kinetics of pure (52m)Mn-citrate at the blood-brain barrier of the monkey were studied experimentally, and the analysis of the data with a reasonable compartment model led to equal efflux and influx parameters for Mn (1.35 +/- 0.3 x 10(-2) min(-1)). By using complexes between Mn and diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, the validity of the proposed model could be confirmed. To describe the observed kinetics of 52Fe/(52m)Mn-citrate, the manganese model was coupled to an iron model, which finally allowed the quantification of two iron-specific parameters: an input rate into global brain tissue of 7.15 +/- 2.6 x 10(-4) min(-1) and a time delay of roughly 24 min to account for the observed activities. The simpler linearization procedure has been proposed and could be applied to all our data sets and is able to replace the complicated nonlinear iron/manganese tracer kinetic model neglecting any influence of manganese on the analysis.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10537064/
Kinetic modelling of [11C]PBR28 for 18 kDa translocator protein PET data: A validation study of vascular modelling in the brain using XBD173 and tissue analysis,"Mattia Veronese, Tiago Reis Marques, Peter S Bloomfield, Gaia Rizzo, Nisha Singh, Deborah Jones, Erjon Agushi, Dominic Mosses, Alessandra Bertoldo, Oliver Howes, Federico Roncaroli, Federico E Turkheimer","The 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO) is a marker of microglia activation in the central nervous system and represents the main target of radiotracers for the in vivo quantification of neuroinflammation with positron emission tomography (PET). TSPO PET is methodologically challenging given the heterogeneous distribution of TSPO in blood and brain. Our previous studies with the TSPO tracers [11C]PBR28 and [11C]PK11195 demonstrated that a model accounting for TSPO binding to the endothelium improves the quantification of PET data. Here, we performed a validation of the kinetic model with the additional endothelial compartment through a displacement study. Seven subjects with schizophrenia, all high-affinity binders, underwent two [11C]PBR28 PET scans before and after oral administration of 90 mg of the TSPO ligand XBD173. The addition of the endothelial component provided a signal compartmentalization much more consistent with the underlying biology, as only in this model, the blocking study produced the expected reduction in the tracer concentration of the specific tissue compartment, whereas the non-displaceable compartment remained unchanged. In addition, we also studied TSPO expression in vessels using 3D reconstructions of histological data of frontal lobe and cerebellum, demonstrating that TSPO positive vessels account for 30% of the vascular volume in cortical and white matter.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28580888/
Rest/stress myocardial perfusion imaging by positron emission tomography with 18F-Flurpiridaz: A feasibility study in mice,"Susan Bengs, Geoffrey I Warnock, Angela Portmann, Nidaa Mikail, Alexia Rossi, Hazem Ahmed, Dominik Etter, Valerie Treyer, Livio Gisler, Stefanie K Pfister, Caitlin V M L Jie, Alexander Meisel, Claudia Keller, Steven H Liang, Roger Schibli, Linjing Mu, Ronny R Buechel, Philipp A Kaufmann, Simon M Ametamey, Catherine Gebhard, Achi Haider","Background: Myocardial perfusion imaging by positron emission tomography (PET-MPI) is the current gold standard for quantification of myocardial blood flow.18F-flurpiridaz was recently introduced as a valid alternative to currently used PET-MPI probes. Nonetheless, optimum scan duration and time interval for image analysis are currently unknown. Further, it is unclear whether rest/stress PET-MPI with18F-flurpiridaz is feasible in mice.

Methods: Rest/stress PET-MPI was performed with18F-flurpiridaz (0.6-3.0 MBq) in 27 mice aged 7-8 months. Regadenoson (0.1 µg/g) was used for induction of vasodilator stress. Kinetic modeling was performed using a metabolite-corrected arterial input function. Image-derived myocardial18F-flurpiridaz uptake was assessed for different time intervals by placing a volume of interest in the left ventricular myocardium.

Results: Tracer kinetics were best described by a two-tissue compartment model. K1ranged from 6.7 to 20.0 mL·cm-3·min-1, while myocardial volumes of distribution (VT) were between 34.6 and 83.6 mL·cm-3. Of note, myocardial18F-flurpiridaz uptake (%ID/g) was significantly correlated with K1at rest and following pharmacological vasodilation for all time intervals assessed. However, while Spearman's coefficients (rs) ranged between 0.478 and 0.681, R2values were generally low. In contrast, an excellent correlation of myocardial18F-flurpiridaz uptake with VTwas obtained, particularly when employing the averaged myocardial uptake from 20 to 40 min post tracer injection (R2≥ 0.98). Notably, K1and VTwere similarly sensitive to pharmacological vasodilation induction. Further, mean stress-to-rest ratios of K1, VT, and %ID/g18F-flurpiridaz were virtually identical, suggesting that %ID/g18F-flurpiridaz can be used to estimate coronary flow reserve (CFR) in mice.

Conclusion: Our findings suggest that a simplified assessment of relative myocardial perfusion and CFR, based on image-derived tracer uptake, is feasible with18F-flurpiridaz in mice, enabling high-throughput mechanistic CFR studies in rodents.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35484467/

Procedures: In five patients with advanced EOC (FIGO stage IIIB/IIIC, Fédération Internationale de Gynécologie et d'Obstétrique), a 90-min dynamic PET acquisition of the pelvis was performed directly after i.v. administration of 185 MBq [18F]fluoro-PEG6-folate. Arterial blood samples collected at nineteen timepoints were used to determine the plasma input function. A static volume of interest (VOI) for included tumor lesions was drawn manually on the PET images. Modelling was performed using PMOD software. Three different models (a 1-tissue compartment model (1T2k) and two 2-tissue compartment models, irreversible (2T3k) and reversible (2T4k)) were compared in goodness of fit with the time activity curves by means of the Akaike information criterion.

Results: The pharmacokinetic analysis in the pelvic area has proven to be much more challenging than expected. Only four out of 22 tumor lesions in five patients were considered suitable to perform modelling on. The remaining tumor lesions were inapt due to either low tracer uptake, small size, proximity to other [18F]fluoro-PEG6-folate -avid structures and/or displacement by abdominal organ motion in the dynamic scan. Data from the four analyzed tumor lesions suggest that the irreversible 2T3k may best describe the pharmacokinetics. All 22 lesions were immunohistochemically stained positive for the folate receptor alpha (FRα) after resection.

Conclusion: Performing pharmacokinetic analysis in the abdominal pelvic region is very challenging. This brief article describes the challenges and pitfalls in pharmacokinetic analysis of a tracer with high physiological accumulation in the intestines, in case of lesions of limited size in the abdominal pelvic area.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38775919/
A novel relative-equilibrium graphical plot for rapid reversible tracer studies in dynamic PET imaging,"Zifeng Tian, Yang Zuo, Peng Xi, Xiangxi Meng, Wenrui Shao, Yidong Yang, Qiushi Ren, Jiangyuan Yu, Zhaoheng Xie","Objective.This study aims to address the issue of long scan durations required by traditional graphical analysis methods, such as the Logan plot and its variant, the reversible equilibrium (RE) Logan plot, for dynamic PET imaging of tracer kinetics.Approach.We propose a relative RE Logan model that builds on the principles of the Logan plot and its variant to significantly reduce scan time without compromising the accuracy of tracer kinetics analysis. The model is supported by theoretical evidence and experimental validations, including two computer simulations and one clinical data analysis.Main results.The proposed model demonstrates a significant linear relationship between the variablexand the slopeof the RE Logan plot, and the variablex' and the slopeDVT'of the relative RE Logan plot.

Using both clinical studies and Monte Carlo simulations, the aim of this study was to determine which tracer kinetic plasma input model best describes (R)-[(11)C]PK11195 kinetics. Dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) scans were performed on 13 subjects while radioactivity in arterial blood was monitored online. Discrete blood samples were taken to generate a metabolite corrected plasma input function. One-tissue, two-tissue irreversible, and two-tissue reversible compartment models, with and without fixing K(1)/k(2) ratio, k(4) or blood volume to whole cortex values, were fitted to the data. The effects of fixing parameters to incorrect values were investigated by varying them over a physiologic range and determining accuracy and reproducibility of binding potential and volume of distribution using Monte Carlo simulations. Clinical data showed that a two-tissue reversible compartment model was optimal for analyzing (R)-[(11)C]PK11195 PET brain studies. Simulations showed that fixing the K(1)/k(2) ratio of this model provided the optimal trade-off between accuracy and reproducibility.

Use of positron emission tomography for the assessment of skeletal muscle glucose metabolism,"Oliver Selberg, Manfred James Müller, Jörg van den Hoff, Wolfgang Burchert","Positron emission tomography (PET) is a unique tool for studying regional skeletal muscle glucose metabolism and blood flow in vivo. The application of PET in the assessment of skeletal muscle glucose metabolism depends on recent improvements in instrumentation, data analysis, and production of (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and (15)O water. The data presented support the validity of the (15)O water model to measure blood flow and the FDG model for the determination of glucose uptake and glucose kinetic constants (influx, efflux, and phosphorylation) in skeletal muscle. However, quantification of absolute glucose transport and backflux rates should be applied with caution because those calculations are based on unproven assumptions such as validity of the lumped constant for these individual processes and constancy of the free and accessible intracellular glucose pool. It is evident that quantification of glucose fluxes using the triple tracer technology generates conflicting data that violate assumptions inherent in triple tracer or PET modeling. Further FDG-PET studies will have to solve those problems to provide more insight into the regulatory processes of glucose transport and phosphorylation of different insulin-resistant disease states. Promising new areas of PET research will include not only detailed study of glucose kinetics but also the measurement of muscle protein synthesis in vivo, which is of interest in a variety of conditions.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11934545/

For each tracer, time-activity curves of both target and reference regions were generated using a simplified 1-tissue-compartment model, with an arterial plasma input function and the predicted kinetic parameters.K1,k2, and BPNDwere derived from the lipophilicity (logP), apparent volume, free fraction in plasma, free fraction in tissue, dissociation constant, and density of amyloid β using biomathematic modeling. Density was fixed at 3 nM to represent healthy control conditions and 50 nM to represent severe Alzheimer disease (AD). Predicted SUVRs for the healthy and AD groups were then obtained by dividing the integrated time-activity curve of the target region by that of the reference region. To validate the presented method, the predictedK1,k2, BPND, and SUVR for the healthy and AD groups were compared with the respective clinically observed values.Results:The correlation between predicted and clinical kinetic parameters had anR2value of 0.73 forK1in the healthy group, 0.71 forK1in the AD group, 0.81 fork2in the healthy group, 0.85 fork2in the AD group, and 0.63 for BPNDin the AD group. The regression relationship between the predicted SUVR (y) and the clinical SUVR (x) for the healthy and the AD groups wasy= 2.73x- 2.11 (R2= 0.72).Conclusion:The proposed method showed a good correlation between predicted and clinical SUVR for the 10 clinically applied amyloid tracers.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28062596/
Ecstasy-induced reduction of the availability of the brain serotonin transporter as revealed by [11C](+)McN5652-PET and the multi-linear reference tissue model: loss of transporters or artifact of tracer kinetic modelling?,"Ralph Buchert, Frank Thiele, Rainer Thomasius, Florian Wilke, Kay Petersen, Winfried Brenner, Janos Mester, Lothar Spies, Malte Clausen","In a previous positron emission tomography (PET) study with the serotonin transporter (SERT) ligand [(11)C](+)McN5652, we found protracted reduction of the availability of the brain SERT in users of the drug ecstasy. However, the multi-linear reference tissue method for the quantification of SERT availability used in this study is prone to effects of altered levels of statistical noise that could simulate reduction of SERT. The aim of the present study was to take into account this confound by re-evaluation of the data now using a modelling approach that is rather insensitive to alterations in the level of statistical noise. A total of 116 subjects (30 current, 29 former ecstasy users, 29 drug-naive, 28 polydrug controls) in whom [(11)C](+)McN5652-PET had been performed previously were re-evaluated. The equilibrium specific-to-non-specific partition coefficient V""( 3) was obtained voxel-wise by application of the simplified reference tissue method (SRTM), which provides quite unbiased results up to rather large noise levels. Voxel-based comparisons between the groups were performed using statistical parametric mapping. V""(3) was reduced in the striatum and in the thalamus in current ecstasy users. This was confirmed by volume-of-interest-based analysis. This result suggests that the ecstasy-induced reduction of SERT availability in SERT-rich brain regions reported previously indicates reduced SERT binding potential rather than being an artifact of tracer kinetic modelling. SRTM analysis did not confirm previous findings in neocortical brain areas.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17092972/
Quantification of Tau Load Using [18F]AV1451 PET,"Sandeep S V Golla, Tessa Timmers, Rik Ossenkoppele, Colin Groot, Sander Verfaillie, Philip Scheltens, Wiesje M van der Flier, Lothar Schwarte, Mark A Mintun, Michael Devous, Robert C Schuit, Albert D Windhorst, Adriaan A Lammertsma, Ronald Boellaard, Bart N M van Berckel, Maqsood Yaqub","Purpose: The tau tracer [18F]AV1451, also known as flortaucipir, is a promising ligand for imaging tau accumulation in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Most of the previous studies have quantified tau load using standardized uptake value ratios (SUVr) derived from a static [18F]AV1451 scan. SUVr may, however, be flow dependent and, especially for longitudinal studies, should be validated against a fully quantitative approach. The objective of this study was to identify the optimal tracer kinetic model for measuring tau load using [18F]AV1451.

Procedures: Following intravenous injection of 225 ± 16 MBq [18F]AV1451, 130 min dynamic PET scans were performed in five biomarker confirmed AD patients and five controls. Arterial blood sampling was performed to obtain a metabolite-corrected plasma input function. Next, regional time-activity curves were generated using PVElab software. These curves were analysed using several pharmacokinetic models.

Results: The reversible single tissue compartment model (1T2k_VB) was the preferred model for all but one control. For AD patients, however, model preference shifted towards a reversible two tissue compartmental model (2T4k_VB). The simplified reference tissue model (SRTM) derived binding potential (BPND) showed good correlation (AD: r2= 0.87, slope = 1.06; controls: r2= 0.87, slope = 0.86) with indirect plasma input binding (distribution volume ratio-1). Standardized uptake value ratios (80-100 min) correlated well with DVR (r2= 0.93, slope = 1.07) and SRTM-derived BPND(r2= 0.84, slope = 0.95). In addition, regional differences in tracer binding between subject groups in different tau-specific regions were observed.

Conclusions: Model preference of [18F]AV1451 appears to depend on subject status and, in particular, VT.

Tracer-kinetic models for measuring cerebral blood flow using externally detected radiotracers,"K B Larson, J Markham, M E Raichle","All tracer-kinetic models currently employed with positron-emission tomography (PET) are based on compartmental assumptions. Our first indication that a compartmental model might suffer from severe limitations in certain circumstances when used with PET occurred when we implemented the Kety tissue-autoradiography technique for measuring CBF and observed that the resulting CBF estimates, rather than remaining constant (to within predictable statistical uncertainty) as expected, fell with increasing scan duration T when T greater than 1 min. After ruling out other explanations, we concluded that a one-compartment model does not possess sufficient realism for adequately describing the movement of labeled water in brain. This article recounts our search for more realistic substitute models. We give our derivations and results for the residue-detection impulse responses for unit capillary-tissue systems of our two candidate distributed-parameter models. In a sequence of trials beginning with the simplest, we tested four progressively more detailed candidate models against data from appropriate residue-detection experiments. In these, we generated high-temporal-resolution counting-rate data reflecting the history of radiolabeled-water uptake and washout in the brains of rhesus monkeys. We describe our treatment of the data to yield model-independent empirical values of CBF and of other parameters. By substituting these into our trial-model functions, we were able to make direct comparisons of the model predictions with the experimental dynamic counting-rate histories, confirming that our reservations concerning the one-compartment model were well founded and obliging us to reject two others. We conclude that a two-barrier distributed-parameter model has the potential of serving as a substitute for the Kety model in PET measurements of CBF in patients, especially when scan durations for T greater than 1 min are desired.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3611204/
Recent advances in parametric neuroreceptor mapping with dynamic PET: basic concepts and graphical analyses,"Seongho Seo, Su Jin Kim, Dong Soo Lee, Jae Sung Lee","Tracer kinetic modeling in dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) has been widely used to investigate the characteristic distribution patterns or dysfunctions of neuroreceptors in brain diseases. Its practical goal has progressed from regional data quantification to parametric mapping that produces images of kinetic-model parameters by fully exploiting the spatiotemporal information in dynamic PET data. Graphical analysis (GA) is a major parametric mapping technique that is independent on any compartmental model configuration, robust to noise, and computationally efficient. In this paper, we provide an overview of recent advances in the parametric mapping of neuroreceptor binding based on GA methods. The associated basic concepts in tracer kinetic modeling are presented, including commonly-used compartment models and major parameters of interest. Technical details of GA approaches for reversible and irreversible radioligands are described, considering both plasma input and reference tissue input models. Their statistical properties are discussed in view of parametric imaging.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25260795/
Preclinical dynamic 18F-FDG PET - tumor characterization and radiotherapy response assessment by kinetic compartment analysis,"Kathrine Røe, Thomas B Aleksandersen, Alexandr Kristian, Line B Nilsen, Therese Seierstad, Hong Qu, Anne H Ree, Dag R Olsen, Eirik Malinen","Background: Non-invasive visualization of tumor biological and molecular processes of importance to diagnosis and treatment response is likely to be critical in individualized cancer therapy. Since conventional static (18)F-FDG PET with calculation of the semi-quantitative parameter standardized uptake value (SUV) may be subject to many sources of variability, we here present an approach of quantifying the (18)F-FDG uptake by analytic two-tissue compartment modeling, extracting kinetic tumor parameters from dynamic (18)F-FDG PET. Further, we evaluate the potential of such parameters in radiotherapy response assessment.

Material and methods: Male, athymic mice with prostate carcinoma xenografts were subjected to dynamic PET either untreated (n=8) or 24 h post-irradiation (7.5 Gy single dose, n=8). After 10 h of fasting, intravenous bolus injections of 10-15 MBq (18)F-FDG were administered and a 1 h dynamic PET scan was performed. 4D emission data were reconstructed using OSEM-MAP, before remote post-processing. Individual arterial input functions were extracted from the image series. Subsequently, tumor (18)F-FDG uptake was fitted voxel-by-voxel to a compartment model, producing kinetic parameter maps.

Results: The kinetic model separated the (18)F-FDG uptake into free and bound tracer and quantified three parameters; forward tracer diffusion (k(1)), backward tracer diffusion (k(2)), and rate of (18)F-FDG phosphorylation, i.e. the glucose metabolism (k(3)). The fitted kinetic model gave a goodness of fit (r(2)) to the observed data ranging from 0.91 to 0.99, and produced parametrical images of all tumors included in the study. Untreated tumors showed homogeneous intra-group median values of all three parameters (k(1), k(2) and k(3)), whereas the parameters significantly increased in the tumors irradiated 24 h prior to (18)F-FDG PET.

Conclusions: This study demonstrates the feasibility of a two-tissue compartment kinetic analysis of dynamic (18)F-FDG PET images. If validated, extracted parametrical maps might contribute to tumor biological characterization and radiotherapy response assessment.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20831478/
Quantitative studies of bone with the use of 18F-fluoride and 99mTc-methylene diphosphonate,"G M Blake, S J Park-Holohan, G J Cook, I Fogelman","This article discusses methods for quantifying bone turnover based on tracer kinetic studies of the short-lived radiopharmaceuticals 99mTc-MDP and 18F-fluoride. Measurements of skeletal clearance obtained by using these tracers reflect the combined effects of skeletal blood flow and osteoblastic activity. The pharmacokinetics of each tracer is described, together with some of the quantitative tests of skeletal function that have been described in the literature. The physiologic interpretation of quantitative measurements of bone obtained with the use of short half-life radionuclides is discussed, and the advantages and limitations of 99mTc-MDP and 18F-fluoride are compared and contrasted. Currently, 18F-fluoride dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) is the technique of choice for physiologically precise quantitative studies of bone. However, comparable data could probably be obtained by using 99mTc-MDP if methods for single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) quantitation were improved.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11200203/
Kinetic modeling in the context of cerebral blood flow quantification by H2(15)O positron emission tomography: the meaning of the permeability coefficient in Renkin-Crone׳s model revisited at capillary scale,"Sylvie Lorthois, Paul Duru, Ian Billanou, Michel Quintard, Pierre Celsis","One the one hand, capillary permeability to water is a well-defined concept in microvascular physiology, and linearly relates the net convective or diffusive mass fluxes (by unit area) to the differences in pressure or concentration, respectively, that drive them through the vessel wall. On the other hand, the permeability coefficient is a central parameter introduced when modeling diffusible tracers transfer from blood vessels to tissue in the framework of compartmental models, in such a way that it is implicitly considered as being identical to the capillary permeability. Despite their simplifying assumptions, such models are at the basis of blood flow quantification by H2(15)O Positron Emission Tomgraphy. In the present paper, we use fluid dynamic modeling to compute the transfers of H2(15)O between the blood and brain parenchyma at capillary scale. The analysis of the so-obtained kinetic data by the Renkin-Crone model, the archetypal compartmental model, demonstrates that, in this framework, the permeability coefficient is highly dependent on both flow rate and capillary radius, contrarily to the central hypothesis of the model which states that it is a physiological constant. Thus, the permeability coefficient in Renkin-Crone׳s model is not conceptually identical to the physiologic permeability as implicitly stated in the model. If a permeability coefficient is nevertheless arbitrarily chosen in the computed range, the flow rate determined by the Renkin-Crone model can take highly inaccurate quantitative values. The reasons for this failure of compartmental approaches in the framework of brain blood flow quantification are discussed, highlighting the need for a novel approach enabling to fully exploit the wealth of information available from PET data.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24637002/
"Masked-Volume-Wise PCA and ""reference Logan"" illustrate similar regional differences in kinetic behavior in human brain PET study using [11C]-PIB","Pasha Razifar, Anna Ringheim, Henry Engler, Håkan Hall, Bengt Långström","Background: Kinetic modeling using reference Logan is commonly used to analyze data obtained from dynamic Positron Emission Tomography (PET) studies on patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and healthy volunteers (HVs) using amyloid imaging agent N-methyl [11C]2-(4'-methylaminophenyl)-6-hydroxy-benzothiazole, [11C]-PIB. The aim of the present study was to explore whether results obtained using the newly introduced method, Masked Volume Wise Principal Component Analysis, MVW-PCA, were similar to the results obtained using reference Logan.

Methods: MVW-PCA and reference Logan were performed on dynamic PET images obtained from four Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients on two occasions (baseline and follow-up) and on four healthy volunteers (HVs). Regions of interest (ROIs) of similar sizes were positioned in different parts of the brain in both AD patients and HVs where the difference between AD patients and HVs is largest. Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and discrimination power (DP) were calculated for images generated by the different methods and the results were compared both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Results: MVW-PCA generated images that illustrated similar regional binding patterns compared to reference Logan images and with slightly higher quality, enhanced contrast, improved SNR and DP, without being based on modeling assumptions. MVW-PCA also generated additional MVW-PC images by using the whole dataset, which illustrated regions with different and uncorrelated kinetic behaviors of the administered tracer. This additional information might improve the understanding of kinetic behavior of the administered tracer.

Conclusion: MVW-PCA is a potential multivariate method that without modeling assumptions generates high quality images, which illustrated similar regional changes compared to modeling methods such as reference Logan. In addition, MVW-PCA could be used as a new technique, applicable not only on dynamic human brain studies but also on dynamic cardiac studies when using PET.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19126243/
Multi-graphical analysis of dynamic PET,"Yun Zhou, Weiguo Ye, James R Brasić, Dean F Wong","In quantitative dynamic PET studies, graphical analysis methods including the Gjedde-Patlak plot, the Logan plot, and the relative equilibrium-based graphical plot (RE plot) (Zhou Y., Ye W., Brasić J.R., Crabb A.H., Hilton J., Wong D.F. 2009b. A consistent and efficient graphical analysis method to improve the quantification of reversible tracer binding in radioligand receptor dynamic PET studies. Neuroimage 44(3):661-670) are based on the theory of a compartmental model with assumptions on tissue tracer kinetics. If those assumptions are violated, then the resulting estimates may be biased. In this study, a multi-graphical analysis method was developed to characterize the non-relative equilibrium effects on the estimates of total distribution volume (DV(T)) from the RE plot. A novel bi-graphical analysis method using the RE plot with the Gjedde-Patlak plot (RE-GP plots) was proposed to estimate DV(T) for the quantification of reversible tracer kinetics that may not be at relative equilibrium states during PET study period. The RE-GP plots and the Logan plot were evaluated by 19 [(11)C]WIN35,428 and 10 [(11)C]MDL100,907 normal human dynamic PET studies with brain tissue tracer kinetics measured at both region of interest (ROI) and pixel levels. A 2-tissue compartment model (2TCM) was used to fit ROI time activity curves (TACs). By applying multi-graphical plots to the 2TCM fitted ROI TACs which were considered as the noise-free tracer kinetics, the estimates of DV(T) from the RE-GP plots, the Logan plot, and the 2TCM fitting were equal to each other. For the measured ROI TACs, there was no significant difference between the estimates of the DV(T) from the RE-GP plots and those from 2TCM fitting (p=0.77), but the estimates of the DV(T) from the Logan plot were significantly (p<0.001) lower, 2.3% on average, than those from 2TCM fitting. There was a highly linear correlation between the ROI DV(T) from the parametric images (Y) and those from the ROI kinetics (X) by using the RE-GP plots (Y=1.01X+0.23, R(2)=0.99). For the Logan plot, the ROI estimates from the parametric images were 13% to 83% lower than those from ROI kinetics. The computational time for generating parametric images was reduced by 69% on average by the RE-GP plots in contrast to the Logan plot. In conclusion, the bi-graphical analysis method using the RE-GP plots was a reliable, robust and computationally efficient kinetic modeling approach to improve the quantification of dynamic PET.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19931403/
Tracer kinetic model of regional pulmonary function using positron emission tomography,"Gaetano G Galletti, José G Venegas","To determine the spatial distributions of pulmonary perfusion, shunt, and ventilation, we developed a compartmental model of regional (13)N-labeled molecular nitrogen ((13)NN) kinetics measured from positron emission tomography (PET) images. The model features a compartment for right heart and pulmonary vasculature and two compartments for each region of interest: 1) aerated alveolar units and 2) alveolar units with no gas content (shunting). The model was tested on PET data from normal animals (dogs and sheep) and from animals with experimentally injured lungs simulating acute respiratory distress syndrome. The analysis yielded estimates of regional perfusion, shunt fraction, and specific ventilation with excellent goodness-of-fit to the data (R(2) > 0.99). Model parameters were estimated to within 10% accuracy in the presence of exaggerated levels of experimental noise by using a Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis. Main advantages of the present model are that 1) it separates intraregional blood flow to aerated alveolar units from that shunting across nonaerated units and 2) it accounts and corrects for intraregional tracer removal by shunting blood when estimating ventilation from subsequent washout of tracer. The model was thus found to provide estimates of regional parameters of pulmonary function in sizes of lung regions that could potentially approach the intrinsic resolution for PET images of (13)NN in lung (approximately 7.0 mm for a multiring PET camera).",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12183508/
Impact of Endothelial 18-kDa Translocator Protein on the Quantification of 18F-DPA-714,"Catriona Wimberley, Sonia Lavisse, Vincent Brulon, Marie-Anne Peyronneau, Claire Leroy, Benedetta Bodini, Philippe Remy, Bruno Stankoff, Irène Buvat, Michel Bottlaender","18F-DPA-714 is a second-generation tracer for PET imaging of the 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO), a marker of neuroinflammation. Analysis and interpretation of TSPO PET are challenging, especially because of the basal expression of TSPO. The aim of this study was to evaluate a compartmental model that accounts for the effect of endothelial TSPO binding on the quantification of18F-DPA-714 PET scans from a cohort of healthy subjects.Methods:Fifteen healthy subjects (9 high-affinity binders and 6 mixed-affinity binders) underwent18F-DPA-714 PET scans with arterial blood sampling and metabolite analysis. The kinetic parameters were quantified using a 2-tissue compartmental model (2TC) as well as a 2TC with an extra, irreversible, compartment for endothelial binding (2TC-1K). These regional parameters and messenger RNA (mRNA) expression specific to endothelial cells were correlated with regional TSPO mRNA expression.Results:The 2TC-1K model was more appropriate than the 2TC for 81% of fits. The total volume of distribution was significantly reduced by 21% ± 12% across all regions with the 2TC-1K, compared with the 2TC. The endothelial binding parameterKbvaried highly across brain regions.Kbstrongly and significantly correlated with all 3 probes extracted for TSPO mRNA expression (r= 0.80,r= 0.79, andr= 0.90), but no correlation was seen with the other binding parameters from the 2TC-1K. For the 2TC, there was a lower but significant correlation between the volume of distribution and one of the TSPO mRNA probes (r= 0.65). A strong, significant correlation was seen between mRNA for TSPO and genes specific to endothelial cells.Conclusion:Accounting for endothelial TSPO in the kinetic model improved the fit of PET data. The high correlation betweenKband TSPO mRNA suggests that the 2TC-1K model reveals more biologic information about the regional density of TSPO than the 2TC. The correlation between TSPO and endothelial cell mRNA supports the relationship between the regional variation ofKband endothelial TSPO. These results can improve the estimation of binding parameter estimates from18F-DPA-714 PET, especially in diseases that induce vascular change.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28775204/
A kinetic model for cardiac PET with [1-carbon-11]-acetate,"J van den Hoff, W Burchert, H G Wolpers, G J Meyer, H Hundeshagen","Carbon-11-labeled acetate is a unique tracer for noninvasive assessment of myocardial oxidative metabolism with PET. Because adequate kinetic models have been missing, data evaluation in the past was performed mostly with phenomenological approaches such as mono- or biexponential fitting which cannot account for the influence of finite input duration and blood volume encountered in noninvasive PET investigations.

Methods: To investigate to what extent the current data evaluation schemes are justified, we developed a comprehensive model of [1-11C]-acetate kinetics in the myocardium which incorporates five tissue compartments: free acetate, activated acetate, CO2 precursors, amino acids and CO2. We derived the analytical solution of the model equations which is used for simulations and data fitting.

Results: The five-compartment model can reproduce in detail known experimental data. The resulting values of the eight model parameters compare favorably with existing biochemical facts. We have established the relation between parameters of the detailed model and one- and two-compartment models used for the evaluation of PET investigations.

Conclusion: The kinetics of [1-11C]-acetate are adequately described by a five-compartment model. One- and two-compartment models are sufficient for simultaneous quantitative assessment of myocardial oxidative metabolism and perfusion with [1-11C]-acetate and PET.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8772659/
Spectral Analysis of Dynamic PET Studies: A Review of 20 Years of Method Developments and Applications,"Mattia Veronese, Gaia Rizzo, Alessandra Bertoldo, Federico E Turkheimer","In Positron Emission Tomography (PET), spectral analysis (SA) allows the quantification of dynamic data by relating the radioactivity measured by the scanner in time to the underlying physiological processes of the system under investigation. Among the different approaches for the quantification of PET data, SA is based on the linear solution of the Laplace transform inversion whereas the measured arterial and tissue time-activity curves of a radiotracer are used to calculate the input response function of the tissue. In the recent years SA has been used with a large number of PET tracers in brain and nonbrain applications, demonstrating that it is a very flexible and robust method for PET data analysis. Differently from the most common PET quantification approaches that adopt standard nonlinear estimation of compartmental models or some linear simplifications, SA can be applied without defining any specific model configuration and has demonstrated very good sensitivity to the underlying kinetics. This characteristic makes it useful as an investigative tool especially for the analysis of novel PET tracers. The purpose of this work is to offer an overview of SA, to discuss advantages and limitations of the methodology, and to inform about its applications in the PET field.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28050197/
Aluminum Fluoride-18 Labeled Mannosylated Dextran: Radiosynthesis and Initial Preclinical Positron Emission Tomography Studies,"Putri Andriana, Konstantina Makrypidi, Heidi Liljenbäck, Johan Rajander, Antti Saraste, Ioannis Pirmettis, Anne Roivainen, Xiang-Guo Li","Purpose: In addition to being expressed on liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, mannose receptors are also found on antigen-presenting cells, including macrophages, which are mainly involved in the inflammation process. Dextran derivatives of various sizes containing cysteine and mannose moieties have previously been labeled with99mTc and used for single-photon emission computed tomography imaging of sentinel lymph nodes. In this study, we radiolabeled 21.3-kDa D10CM with positron-emitting18F for initial positron emission tomography (PET) studies in rats.

Procedures: D10CM was conjugated with 1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1,4,7-triacetic acid (NOTA) chelator and radiolabeled with the aluminum fluoride-18 method. The whole-body distribution kinetics and stability of the intravenously administered tracer were studied in healthy male Sprague-Dawley rats by in vivo PET/CT imaging, ex vivo gamma counting, and high-performance liquid chromatography analysis.

Results: Al[18F]F-NOTA-D10CM was obtained with a radiochemical purity of >99% and molar activity of 9.9 GBq/μmol. At 60 minutes after injection, an average of 84% of the intact tracer was found in the blood, indicating excellent in vivo stability. The highest radioactivity concentration was seen in the liver, spleen, and bone marrow, in which mannose receptors are highly expressed under physiological conditions. The uptake specificity was confirmed with in vivo blocking experiments.

Conclusions: Our results imply that Al[18F]F-NOTA-D10CM is a suitable tracer for PET imaging. Further studies in disease models with mannose receptor CD206-positive macrophages are warranted to clarify the tracer's potential for imaging of inflammation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37016195/
Kinetic analysis of 2-[11C]thymidine PET imaging studies: validation studies,"D A Mankoff, A F Shields, J M Link, M M Graham, M Muzi, L M Peterson, J F Eary, K A Krohn","2-[11C]thymidine has been tested as a PET tracer of cellular proliferation. We have previously described a model of thymidine and labeled metabolite kinetics for use in quantifying the flux of thymidine into DNA as a measure of tumor proliferation. We describe here the results of studies to validate some of the model's assumptions and to test the model's ability to predict the time course of tracer incorporation into DNA in tumors.

Methods: Three sets of studies were conducted: (a) The uptake of tracers in proliferative tissues of normal mice was measured early after injection to assess the relative delivery of thymidine and metabolites of thymidine catabolism (thymine and CO2) and calculate relative blood-tissue transfer rates (relative K1s). (b) By using sequential injections of [11C]thymidine and [11C]thymine in normal human volunteers, the kinetics of the first labeled metabolite were measured to determine whether it was trapped in proliferating tissue such as the bone marrow. (c) In a multitumor rat model, 2-[14C]thymidine injection, tumor sampling and quantitative DNA extraction were performed to measure the time course of label uptake into DNA for comparison with model predictions.

Results: Studies in mice showed consistent relative delivery of thymidine and metabolites in somatic tissue but, as expected, showed reduced delivery of thymidine and thymine in the normal brain compared to CO2. Thymine studies in volunteers showed only minimal trapping of label in bone marrow in comparison to thymidine. This quantity of trapping could be explained by a small amount of fixation of labeled CO2 in tissue, a process that is included as part of the model. Uptake experiments in rats showed early incorporation of label into DNA, and the model was able to fit the time course of uptake.

Conclusion: These initial studies support the assumptions of the compartmental model and demonstrate its ability to quantify thymidine flux into DNA by using 2-[11C]thymidine and PET. Results suggest that further work will be necessary to investigate the effects of tumor heterogeneity and to compare PET measures of tumor proliferation to in vitro measures of proliferation and to clinical tumor behavior in patients undergoing therapy.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10210220/

Plasma kinetics, brain uptake, and preliminary quantitative analysis of18F-MK-6240 in healthy elderly (HE) subjects, subjects with clinically probable Alzheimer disease (AD), and subjects with amnestic mild cognitive impairment were characterized in a study that is, to our knowledge, the first to be performed on humans.Methods:Dynamic PET scans of up to 150 min were performed on 4 cognitively normal HE subjects, 4 AD subjects, and 2 amnestic mild cognitive impairment subjects after a bolus injection of 152-169 MBq of18F-MK-6240 to evaluate tracer kinetics and distribution in brain. Regional SUV ratio (SUVR) and distribution volume ratio were determined using the cerebellar cortex as a reference region. Total distribution volume was assessed by compartmental modeling using radiometabolite-corrected input function in a subgroup of 6 subjects.Results:18F-MK-6240 had rapid brain uptake with a peak SUV of 3-5, followed by a uniformly quick washout from all brain regions in HE subjects; slower clearance was observed in regions commonly associated with NFT deposition in AD subjects. In AD subjects, SUVR between 60 and 90 min after injection was high (approximately 2-4) in regions associated with NFT deposition, whereas in HE subjects, SUVR was approximately 1 across all brain regions, suggesting high tracer selectivity for binding NFTs in vivo.18F-MK-6240 total distribution volume was approximately 2- to 3-fold higher in neocortical and medial temporal brain regions of AD subjects than in HE subjects and stabilized by 60 min in both groups. Distribution volume ratio estimated by the Logan reference tissue model or compartmental modeling correlated well (R2> 0.9) to SUVR from 60 to 90 min for AD subjects.Conclusion:18F-MK-6240 exhibited favorable kinetics and high binding levels to brain regions with a plausible pattern for NFT deposition in AD subjects. In comparison, negligible tracer binding was observed in HE subjects. This pilot study suggests that simplified ratio methods such as SUVR can be used to quantify NFT binding. These results support further clinical development of18F-MK-6240 for potential application in longitudinal studies.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29880509/

PET/CT imaging reveals unrivaled placental avidity for glucose compared to other tissues,"A B Sawatzke, A W Norris, F Spyropoulos, S A Walsh, M R Acevedo, S Hu, J Yao, C Wang, J J Sunderland, L L Boles Ponto","Introduction: The goal of this study was to define the kinetics of glucose transport from maternal blood to placenta to fetus using real time imaging.

Methods: Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of the glucose-tracer [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) was used to temporally and spatially define, in vivo, the kinetics of glucose transport from maternal blood into placentae and fetuses, in the late gestational gravid rat. Computed tomography (CT), with intravenous contrast, co-registered to the PET images allowed anatomic differentiation of placentae from fetal and maternal tissues.

Results: FDG was rapidly taken up by placentae and subsequently appeared in fetuses with minimal temporal lag. FDG standardized uptake values in placentae and fetuses approached that of maternal brain. In both anesthetized and awake dams, one quarter of the administered FDG ultimately was accrued in the collective fetuses and placentae. Accordingly, kinetic modeling demonstrated that the placentae had very high avidity for FDG, 2-fold greater than that of the fetus and maternal brain, when accounting for the fact that fetal FDG necessarily must first be taken up by placentae. Consistent with this, placental expression of glucose transporter 1 exceeded that of all other tissues.

Discussion: Fetal and placental tissues place a substantial glucose metabolic burden on the mother, owing to very high avidity of placentae for glucose coupled with the large relative mass of fetal and placental tissues.

Conclusions: The placenta has a tremendous capacity to uptake and transport glucose. PET/CT imaging is an ideal means to study metabolite transport kinetics in the fetoplacental unit.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25555498/

This study presents, to our knowledge, the first-in-human experience with (18)F-FEOBV, including radiation dosimetry, biodistribution, tolerability and safety in human subjects, and brain kinetics and methods for quantitative analysis of (18)F-FEOBV.

Methods: Whole-body (18)F-FEOBV scans were obtained in 3 healthy human volunteers. Seven additional subjects underwent dynamic brain imaging 0-120, 150-180, and 210-240 min after bolus injection of (18)F-FEOBV. Arterial blood sampling was performed with chromatographic identification of authentic (18)F-FEOBV to determine the arterial plasma input function. Analysis methods included nonlinear least-squares fitting of a 2-tissue-compartmental model, reference tissue modeling, and late single-scan imaging.

Results: No pharmacologic or physiologic changes were observed after intravenous administration of up to 1.3 μg of (18)F-FEOBV. Radiation dosimetry estimates indicate that more than 400 MBq may be administered without exceeding regulatory radiation dose limits. Kinetic analysis showed brain uptake to be relatively high with single-pass extraction of 25%-35%. VAChT binding estimates varied by a factor of greater than 30 between the striatum and cortex. Coefficients of variation in k3 estimates varied from 15% to 30%. Volume of distribution measures yielded a dynamic range of approximately 15 but with little reduction in variability. Reference tissue approaches yielded more stable estimates of the distribution volume ratio (1 + BPND), with coefficients of variation ranging from 20% in the striatum to 6%-12% in cortical regions. The late static distribution of (18)F-FEOBV correlated highly with the distribution volume ratio estimates from reference tissue models (r = 0.993).

Conclusion: (18)F-FEOBV PET confirms that the tracer binds to VAChT with the expected in vivo human brain distribution. Both reference tissue modeling and late static scanning approaches provide a robust index of VAChT binding.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24481024/
Dual-[11C]tracer single-acquisition positron emission tomography studies,"R A Koeppe, D M Raffel, S E Snyder, E P Ficaro, M R Kilbourn, D E Kuhl","The ability to study multiple physiologic processes of the brain simultaneously within the same subject would provide a new means to explore the interactions between neurotransmitter systems in vivo. Currently, examination of two distinct neuropharmacologic measures with positron emission tomography (PET) necessitates performing two separate scans spaced in time to allow for radionuclide decay. The authors present results from a dual-tracer PET study protocol using a single dynamic-scan acquisition where the injections of two tracers are offset by several minutes. Kinetic analysis is used to estimate neuropharmacologic parameters for both tracers simultaneously using a combined compartmental model configuration. This approach results in a large reduction in total study time of nearly 2 hours for carbon-11-labeled tracers. As multiple neuropharmacologic measures are obtained at nearly the same time, interventional protocols involving a pair of dual-tracer scans become feasible in a single PET session. Both computer simulations and actual human PET studies were performed using combinations of three different tracers: [11C]flumazenil, N-[11C]methylpiperidinyl propionate, and [ 11 C]dihydrotetrabenazine. Computer simulations of tracer-injection separations of 10 to 30 minutes showed the feasibility of the approach for separations down to 15 to 20 minutes or less. Dual-tracer PET studies were performed in 32 healthy volunteers using injection separations of 10, 15, or 20 minutes. Model parameter estimates for each tracer were similar to those obtained from previously performed single-injection studies. Voxel-by-voxel parametric images were of good quality for injections spaced by 20 minutes and were nearly as good for 15-minute separations, but were degraded noticeably for some model parameters when injections were spaced by only 10 minutes. The authors conclude that dual-tracer single-scan PET is feasible, yields accurate estimates of multiple neuropharmacologic measures, and can be implemented with a number of different radiotracer pairs.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11740210/
Evaluation of rapid dual-tracer (62)Cu-PTSM + (62)Cu-ATSM PET in dogs with spontaneously occurring tumors,"Noel F Black, Scott McJames, Thomas C Rust, Dan J Kadrmas","We are developing methods for imaging multiple PET tracers in a single scan with staggered injections, where imaging measures for each tracer are separated and recovered using differences in tracer kinetics and radioactive decay. In this work, signal separation performance for rapid dual-tracer (62)Cu-PTSM (blood flow) + (62)Cu-ATSM (hypoxia) tumor imaging was evaluated in a large animal model. Four dogs with pre-existing tumors received a series of dynamic PET scans with (62)Cu-PTSM and (62)Cu-ATSM, permitting evaluation of a rapid dual-tracer protocol designed by previous simulation work. Several imaging measures were computed from the dual-tracer data and compared with those from separate, single-tracer imaging. Static imaging measures (e.g. SUV) for each tracer were accurately recovered from dual-tracer data. The wash-in (k(1)) and wash-out (k(2)) rate parameters for both tracers were likewise well recovered (r = 0.87-0.99), but k(3) was not accurately recovered for PTSM (r = 0.19) and moderately well recovered for ATSM (r = 0.70). Some degree of bias was noted, however, which may potentially be overcome through further refinement of the signal separation algorithms. This work demonstrates that complementary information regarding tumor blood flow and hypoxia can be acquired by a single dual-tracer PET scan, and also that the signal separation procedure works effectively for real physiologic data with realistic levels of kinetic model mismatch. Rapid multi-tracer PET has the potential to improve tumor assessment for image-guide therapy and monitoring, and further investigation with these and other tracers is warranted.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18182698/
Multiparametric cardiac18F-FDG PET in humans: pilot comparison of FDG delivery rate with82Rb myocardial blood flow,"Yang Zuo, Javier E López, Thomas W Smith, Cameron C Foster, Richard E Carson, Ramsey D Badawi, Guobao Wang","Myocardial blood flow (MBF) and flow reserve are usually quantified in the clinic with positron emission tomography (PET) using a perfusion-specific radiotracer (e.g.82Rb-chloride). However, the clinical accessibility of existing perfusion tracers remains limited. Meanwhile,18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is a commonly used radiotracer for PET metabolic imaging without similar limitations. In this paper, we explore the potential of18F-FDG for myocardial perfusion imaging by comparing the myocardial FDG delivery rateK1with MBF as determined by dynamic82Rb PET in fourteen human subjects with heart disease. Two sets of FDGK1were derived from one-hour dynamic FDG scans. One was the original FDGK1estimates and the other was the correspondingK1values that were linearly normalized for blood glucose levels. A generalized Renkin-Crone model was used to fit FDGK1with Rb MBF, which then allowed for a nonlinear extraction fraction correction for converting FDGK1to MBF. The linear correlation between FDG-derived MBF and Rb MBF was moderate (r= 0.79) before the glucose normalization and became much improved (r> 0.9) after glucose normalization. The extraction fraction of FDG was also similar to that of Rb-chloride in the myocardium. The results from this pilot study suggest that dynamic cardiac FDG-PET with tracer kinetic modeling has the potential to provide MBF in addition to its conventional use for metabolic imaging.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34280905/
Direct Reconstruction of Linear Parametric Images From Dynamic PET Using Nonlocal Deep Image Prior,"Kuang Gong, Ciprian Catana, Jinyi Qi, Quanzheng Li","Direct reconstruction methods have been developed to estimate parametric images directly from the measured PET sinograms by combining the PET imaging model and tracer kinetics in an integrated framework. Due to limited counts received, signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) and resolution of parametric images produced by direct reconstruction frameworks are still limited. Recently supervised deep learning methods have been successfully applied to medical imaging denoising/reconstruction when large number of high-quality training labels are available. For static PET imaging, high-quality training labels can be acquired by extending the scanning time. However, this is not feasible for dynamic PET imaging, where the scanning time is already long enough. In this work, we proposed an unsupervised deep learning framework for direct parametric reconstruction from dynamic PET, which was tested on the Patlak model and the relative equilibrium Logan model. The training objective function was based on the PET statistical model. The patient's anatomical prior image, which is readily available from PET/CT or PET/MR scans, was supplied as the network input to provide a manifold constraint, and also utilized to construct a kernel layer to perform non-local feature denoising. The linear kinetic model was embedded in the network structure as a 1 ×1 ×1 convolution layer. Evaluations based on dynamic datasets of18F-FDG and11C-PiB tracers show that the proposed framework can outperform the traditional and the kernel method-based direct reconstruction methods.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34652998/
Evaluation of [18F]PF-06455943 as a Potential LRRK2 PET Imaging Agent in the Brain of Nonhuman Primates,"Chi-Hyeon Yoo, Zhen Chen, Nisha Rani, Jiahui Chen, Jian Rong, Laigao Chen, Lei Zhang, Steven H Liang, Hsiao-Ying Wey","Mutations in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene are the common causes of inherited Parkinson's disease (PD) and emerged as a causative PD gene. Particularly, LRRK2-Gly2019Ser mutation was reported to alter the early phase of neuronal differentiation, increasing cell death. Selective inhibitors of LRRK2 kinase activity were considered as a promising therapeutic target for PD treatment. However, the development of effective brain-penetrant LRRK2 inhibitors remains challenging. Recently, we have developed a novel positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand for LRRK2 imaging and demonstrated preferable tracer properties in rodents. Herein, we evaluate [18F]PF-06455943 quantification methods in the nonhuman primate (NHP) brain using full kinetic modeling with radiometabolite-corrected arterial blood samples, and homologous blocking with two doses (0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg). Kinetic analysis results demonstrated that a two-tissue compartmental model and a Logan graphical analysis are appropriate for [18F]PF-06455943 PET quantification. In addition, we observed that total distribution volume (VT) values can be reliably estimated with as short as a 30 min scan duration. Homologous blocking studies confirmed the specific binding of [18F]PF-06455943 and revealed that the nonradioactive mass of PF-06455943 achieved 45-55% ofVTdisplacement in the whole brain.

Positron emission tomography: imaging and quantification of neurotransporter availability,"Marc Laruelle, Mark Slifstein, Yiyun Huang","Over the last decade, a large number of radiotracers have been developed to image and quantify transporter availability with positron emission tomography (PET) or single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Radiotracers suitable to image dopamine transporters (DATs) and serotonin transporters (SERTs) have been the object of most efforts. Following a brief overview of DAT and SERT radiotracers that have been demonstrated to be suitable for quantitative analysis in vivo, this article describes the principal methods that have been used for the analysis of these data. Kinetic modeling is the most direct implementation of the compartment models, but with some tracers accurate input function measurement and good compartment configuration identification can be difficult to obtain. Other methods were designed to overcome some particular vulnerability to error of classic kinetic modeling, but introduced new vulnerabilities in the process. Reference region methods obviate the need for arterial plasma measurement, but are not as robust to violations of the underlying modeling assumptions as methods using the arterial input function. Graphical methods give estimates of distribution volumes without the requirement of compartment model specification, but provide a biased estimator in the presence of statistical noise. True equilibrium methods are quite robust, but their use is limited to experiments with tracers that are suitable for constant infusion. In conclusion, no universally ""best"" method is applicable to all neurotransporter imaging studies, and careful evaluation of model-based methods is required for each radiotracer.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12183117/
Plasma radio-metabolite analysis of PET tracers for dynamic PET imaging: TLC and autoradiography,"Fiona Li, Justin W Hicks, Lihai Yu, Lise Desjardin, Laura Morrison, Jennifer Hadway, Ting-Yim Lee","Background: In molecular imaging with dynamic PET, the binding and dissociation of a targeted tracer is characterized by kinetics modeling which requires the arterial concentration of the tracer to be measured accurately. Once in the body the radiolabeled parent tracer may be subjected to hydrolysis, demethylation/dealkylation and other biochemical processes, resulting in the production and accumulation of different metabolites in blood which can be labeled with the same PET radionuclide as the parent. Since these radio-metabolites cannot be distinguished by PET scanning from the parent tracer, their contribution to the arterial concentration curve has to be removed for the accurate estimation of kinetic parameters from kinetic analysis of dynamic PET. High-performance liquid chromatography has been used to separate and measure radio-metabolites in blood plasma; however, the method is labor intensive and remains a challenge to implement for each individual patient. The purpose of this study is to develop an alternate technique based on thin layer chromatography (TLC) and a sensitive commercial autoradiography system (Beaver, Ai4R, Nantes, France) to measure radio-metabolites in blood plasma of two targeted tracers-[18F]FAZA and [18F]FEPPA, for imaging hypoxia and inflammation, respectively.

Results: Radioactivity as low as 17 Bq in 2 µL of pig's plasma can be detected on the TLC plate using autoradiography. Peaks corresponding to the parent tracer and radio-metabolites could be distinguished in the line profile through each sample (n = 8) in the autoradiographic image. Significant intersubject and intra-subject variability in radio-metabolites production could be observed with both tracers. For [18F]FEPPA, 50% of plasma activity was from radio-metabolites as early as 5-min post injection, while for [18F]FAZA, significant metabolites did not appear until 50-min post. Simulation study investigating the effect of radio-metabolite in the estimation of kinetic parameters indicated that 32-400% parameter error can result without radio-metabolites correction.

Conclusion: TLC coupled with autoradiography is a good alternative to high-performance liquid chromatography for radio-metabolite correction. The advantages of requiring only small blood samples (~ 100 μL) and of analyzing multiple samples simultaneously, make the method suitable for individual dynamic PET studies.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33226509/
Multiparametric dynamic whole-body PSMA PET/CT using [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 and [18F]PSMA-1007,"André H Dias, Mads R Jochumsen, Helle D Zacho, Ole L Munk, Lars C Gormsen","Background: Routine prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positron emission tomography (PET) performed for primary staging or restaging of prostate cancer patients is usually done as a single static image acquisition 60 min after tracer administration. In this study, we employ dynamic whole-body (D-WB) PET imaging to compare the pharmacokinetics of [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 and [18F]PSMA-1007 in various tissues and lesions, and to assess whether Patlak parametric images are quantitative and improve lesion detection and image readability.

Methods: Twenty male patients with prostate cancer were examined using a D-WB PSMA PET protocol. Ten patients were scanned with [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 and ten with [18F]PSMA-1007. Kinetic analyses were made using time-activity curves (TACs) extracted from organs (liver, spleen, bone, and muscle) and lesions. For each patient, three images were produced: SUV + Patlak parametric images (Kiand DV). All images were reviewed visually to compare lesion detection, image readability was quantified using target-to-background ratios (TBR), and Ki and DV values were compared.

Results: The two PSMA tracers exhibited markedly different pharmacokinetics in organs: reversible for [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 and irreversible for [18F]PSMA-1007. For both tracers, lesions kinetics were best described by an irreversible model. All parametric images were of good visual quality using both radiotracers. In general, Ki images were characterized by reduced vascular signal and increased lesion TBR compared with SUV images. No additional malignant lesions were identified on the parametric images.

Conclusion: D-WB PET/CT is feasible for both PSMA tracers allowing for direct reconstruction of parametric Ki images. The use of multiparametric PSMA images increased TBR but did not lead to the detection of more lesions. For quantitative whole-body Ki imaging, [18F]PSMA-1007 should be preferred over [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 due to its irreversible kinetics in organs and lesions.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37060394/
[11C]Flumazenil PET in temporal lobe epilepsy: do we need an arterial input function or kinetic modeling?,"Alexander Hammers, Prasan Panagoda, Rolf A Heckemann, Wolfgang Kelsch, Federico E Turkheimer, David J Brooks, John S Duncan, Matthias J Koepp","Reduced signal on [(11)C]]flumazenil (FMZ) positron emission tomography (PET) is associated with epileptogenic foci. Linear correlations within individuals between parametric and nonparametric images of FMZ binding have been shown, and various methods have been used, without comparison of diagnostic usefulness. Using hippocampal sclerosis (HS) as a test case, we formally compare the diagnostic yield of parametric images obtained either with a parent tracer arterial plasma input function and spectral analysis (yielding volume-of-distribution (VD) images), or with an image-based input function and the simplified reference tissue model (binding potential images, BP-SRTM) with the diagnostic yield of semiquantitative-integrated (ADD) images from 10 to 20 or 20 to 40 mins (ADD1020 and ADD2040). Dynamic 90-min [(11)C]FMZ PET datasets and arterial plasma input functions were available for 15 patients with medically refractory medial temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and histologically verified unilateral HS and for 13 control subjects. SPM2 was used for analysis. ADD1020 and ADD2040 images showed decreased FMZ uptake ipsilateral to the epileptogenic hippocampus in 13/15 cases; 6/13 had bilateral decreases in the ADD1020 analysis and 5/13 in the ADD2040 analysis. BP-SRTM images detected ipsilateral decreases in 12/15 cases, with bilateral decreases in three. In contrast, VD images showed ipsilateral hippocampal decreases in all 15 patients, with bilateral decreases in three patients. Bilateral decreases in the ADD images tended to be more symmetrical and in one case were more marked contralaterally. Full quantification with an image-independent input should ideally be used in the evaluation of FMZ PET; at least in TLE, intrasubject correlations do not predict equivalent clinical usefulness.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17579659/
"Pre-clinical evaluation of a 3-nitro-1,2,4-triazole analogue of [18F]FMISO as hypoxia-selective tracer for PET","Romain Bejot, Veerle Kersemans, Catherine Kelly, Laurence Carroll, Robert C King, Véronique Gouverneur, Arkadij M Elizarov, Carroll Ball, Jianzhong Zhang, Reza Miraghaie, Hartmuth C Kolb, Sean Smart, Sally Hill","Hypoxia in solid tumours is associated with the promotion of various metabolic mechanisms and induces resistance to radio- and chemotherapy. Non-invasive positron emission tomography (PET) or single photon emission computed tomography by use of selective biomarkers has emerged as valuable tools for the detection of hypoxic areas within tumours so treatment can be modified accordingly. The aim of this investigation was to evaluate [(18)F]3-NTR, a 3-nitro-1,2,4-triazole analogue (N(1) substituted) of [(18)F]FMISO as a potential hypoxia selective tracer. 3-NTR and its (18)F-radiolabelled isotopic isomer were synthesised and compared with FMISO in vitro and in vivo. Their physicochemical properties were measured, the enzymatic reduction was evaluated, and the reactivity of their metabolites was investigated. Biodistribution and PET scans were performed on CBA mice bearing hypoxic CaNT tumour cells, using (18)F-labelled versions of the tracers. [(18)F]3-NTR uptake within hypoxic cells was lower than [(18)F]FMISO and [(18)F]3-NTR did not exhibit any better selectivity than FMISO as a PET tracer in vivo. Both (18)F-radiolabelled compounds are relatively evenly distributed within the whole body and the radioactive uptake within hypoxic tumours reaches a maximum at 30 min post injection and decreases thereafter. Xanthine oxidase exhibited a nitroreductase activity toward 3-NTR under anaerobic conditions, but reduced metabolites did not bind covalently. It is confirmed that 3-NTR is an electron acceptor. It is postulated that radiolabelled metabolites and fragments of [(18)F]3-NTR are freely diffusing due to their poor binding capacities. Thus [(18)F]3-NTR cannot be used as a hypoxia selective tracer for PET. The investigation provides insights into the importance of the propensity to form covalent adducts for such biomarkers.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20610161/
Cerebral blood flow measurements with 15O-water PET using a non-invasive machine-learning-derived arterial input function,"Samuel Kuttner, Kristoffer Knutsen Wickstrøm, Mark Lubberink, Andreas Tolf, Joachim Burman, Rune Sundset, Robert Jenssen, Lieuwe Appel, Jan Axelsson","Cerebral blood flow (CBF) can be measured with dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) of15O-labeled water by using tracer kinetic modelling. However, for quantification of regional CBF, an arterial input function (AIF), obtained from arterial blood sampling, is required. In this work we evaluated a novel, non-invasive approach for input function prediction based on machine learning (MLIF), against AIF for CBF PET measurements in human subjects.Twenty-five subjects underwent two 10 min dynamic15O-water brain PET scans with continuous arterial blood sampling, before (baseline) and following acetazolamide medication. Three different image-derived time-activity curves were automatically segmented from the carotid arteries and used as input into a Gaussian process-based AIF prediction model, considering both baseline and acetazolamide scans as training data. The MLIF approach was evaluated by comparing AIF and MLIF curves, as well as whole-brain grey matter CBF values estimated by kinetic modelling derived with either AIF or MLIF.The results showed that AIF and MLIF curves were similar and that corresponding CBF values were highly correlated and successfully differentiated before and after acetazolamide medication. In conclusion, our non-invasive MLIF method shows potential to replace the AIF obtained from blood sampling for CBF measurements using15O-water PET and kinetic modelling.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33557691/
First-in-human evaluation of [18F]CETO: a novel tracer for adrenocortical tumours,"Isabella Silins, Anders Sundin, Mark Lubberink, Lleah O'Sullivan, Mark Gurnell, Franklin Aigbirhio, Morris Brown, Anders Wall, Tobias Åkerström, Sara Roslin, Per Hellman, Gunnar Antoni","Purpose: [11C]Metomidate positron emission tomography (PET) is currently used for staging of adrenocortical carcinoma and for lateralization in primary aldosteronism (PA). Due to the short half-life of carbon-11 and a high non-specific liver uptake of [11C]metomidate there is a need for improved adrenal imaging methods. In a previous pre-clinical study para-chloro-2-[18F]fluoroethyletomidate has been proven to be a specific adrenal tracer. The objective is to perform a first evaluation of para-chloro-2-[18F]fluoroethyletomidate positron emission computed tomography ([18F]CETO-PET/CT) in patients with adrenal tumours and healthy volunteers.

Methods: Fifteen patients underwent [18F]CETO-PET/CT. Five healthy volunteers were recruited for test-retest analysis and three out of the five underwent additional [15O]water PET/CT to measure adrenal blood flow. Arterial blood sampling and tracer metabolite analysis was performed. The kinetics of [18F]CETO were assessed and simplified quantitative methods were validated by comparison to outcome measures of tracer kinetic analysis.

Results: Uptake of [18F]CETO was low in the liver and high in adrenals. Initial metabolization was rapid, followed by a plateau. The kinetics of [18F]CETO in healthy adrenals and all adrenal pathologies, except for adrenocortical carcinoma, were best described by an irreversible single-tissue compartment model. Standardized uptake values (SUV) correlated well with the uptake rate constant K1. Both K1and SUV were highly correlated to adrenal blood flow in healthy controls. Repeatability coefficients of K1, SUV65-70, and SUV120were 25, 22, and 17%.

Conclusions: High adrenal uptake combined with a low unspecific liver uptake suggests that18F]CETO is a suitable tracer for adrenal imaging. Adrenal SUV, based on a whole-body scan at 1 h p.i., correlated well with the net uptake rate Ki.

"Initial evaluation of 18F-GE-179, a putative PET Tracer for activated N-methyl D-aspartate receptors","Colm J McGinnity, Alexander Hammers, Daniela A Riaño Barros, Sajinder K Luthra, Paul A Jones, William Trigg, Caroline Micallef, Mark R Symms, David J Brooks, Matthias J Koepp, John S Duncan","N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) ion channels play a key role in a wide range of physiologic (e.g., memory and learning tasks) and pathologic processes (e.g., excitotoxicity). To date, suitable PET markers of NMDA ion channel activity have not been available. (18)F-GE-179 is a novel radioligand that selectively binds to the open/active state of the NMDA receptor ion channel, displacing the binding of (3)H-tenocyclidine from the intrachannel binding site with an affinity of 2.4 nM. No significant binding was observed with 10 nM GE-179 at 60 other neuroreceptors, channels, or transporters. We describe the kinetic behavior of the radioligand in vivo in humans.

Methods: Nine healthy participants (6 men, 3 women; median age, 37 y) each underwent a 90-min PET scan after an intravenous injection of (18)F-GE-179. Continuous arterial blood sampling over the first 15 min was followed by discrete blood sampling over the duration of the scan. Brain radioactivity (KBq/mL) was measured in summation images created from the attenuation- and motion-corrected dynamic images. Metabolite-corrected parent plasma input functions were generated. We assessed the abilities of 1-, 2-, and 3-compartment models to kinetically describe cerebral time-activity curves using 6 bilateral regions of interest. Parametric volume-of-distribution (V(T)) images were generated by voxelwise rank-shaping regularization of exponential spectral analysis (RS-ESA).

Results: A 2-brain-compartment, 4-rate-constant model best described the radioligand's kinetics in normal gray matter of subjects at rest. At 30 min after injection, 37% of plasma radioactivity represented unmetabolized (18)F-GE-179. The highest mean levels of gray matter radioactivity were seen in the putamina and peaked at 7.5 min. A significant positive correlation was observed between K1 and V(T) (Spearman ρ = 0.398; P = 0.003). Between-subject coefficients of variation of V(T) ranged between 12% and 16%. Voxelwise RS-ESA yielded similar V(T)s and coefficients of variation.

Conclusion: (18)F-GE-179 exhibits high and rapid brain extraction, with a relatively homogeneous distribution in gray matter and acceptable between-subject variability. Despite its rapid peripheral metabolism, quantification of (18)F-GE-179 VT is feasible both within regions of interest and at the voxel level. The specificity of (18)F-GE-179 binding, however, requires further characterization with in vivo studies using activation and disease models.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24525206/

Methods: Six beagle dogs underwent a single baseline dynamic [18F]DHMT PET study, whereas one animal underwent three serial dynamic studies over the course of chronic doxorubicin administration (1 mg·kg-1·week-1for 15 weeks). During the scans, sequential arterial blood samples were obtained for plasma metabolite correction. The optimal compartment model and graphical analysis method were identified for kinetic modeling. Values for the left ventricular (LV) net influx rate, Ki, were reported for all the studies and compared with the LV standard uptake values (SUVs) and the LV-to-blood pool SUV ratios from the 60 to 90 minute static images. Parametric images were also generated.

Results: [18F]DHMT followed irreversible kinetics once oxidized within the myocardium in the presence of superoxide, as evidenced by the fitting generated by the irreversible two-tissue (2Ti) compartment model and the linearity of Patlak analysis. Myocardial Kivalues showed a weak correlation with LV SUV (R2= 0.27), but a strong correlation with LV-to-blood pool SUV ratio (R2= 0.92). Generation of high-quality parametric images showed superior myocardial to blood contrast compared to static images.

The aim of this work was to contribute to the verification of the tracer kinetic modelling in human studies. Five healthy volunteers were scanned twice after intravenous bolus injection of approximately 370 MBq [(11)C]MDL 100,907 using dynamic PET. One scan was performed under baseline condition, the other scan commenced 90 mins after a single oral dose of 30 mg of the antidepressant mirtazapine, which binds to the 5-HT(2A) receptor. There did not appear to be radiolabelled metabolites of [(11)C]MDL 100,907 in human plasma, which are likely to cross the blood-brain barrier. Total volumes of distribution VD in 11 different brain regions were estimated using a reversible, two tissue, four rate constants compartment model with a variable fractional blood volume term and the metabolite-corrected plasma input function. There were no significant changes of the VD in the cerebellum between the baseline and the blocked scans confirming the cerebellum as a region devoid of displaceable binding. Regional estimates of binding potential were then obtained indirectly using the cerebellar VD and occupancies calculated. The mean occupancy with this clinically effective dose of mirtazapine was 60% without significant regional differences. This study confirmed the use of an arterial input kinetic model for the quantification of 5-HT(2A) receptor binding with [(11)C]MDL 100,907 and the use of the cerebellum as a reference region for the free and nonspecific binding.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16685260/
Kinetic Models for Measuring P-glycoprotein Function at the Blood-Brain Barrier with Positron Emission Tomography,Mark Lubberink,"P-glycoprotein function is associated with a number of neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases as well as with pharmacoresistance to for example antiepileptic drugs. The ability to measure P-gp function in vivo would allow for an increased understanding of the mechanisms of disease and treatment. This review assesses the various approaches to in vivo quantification of P-gp function using currently available P-gp tracers and PET in humans. First, the use of compartment models, and their interpretation in terms of P-gp function at the blood-brain barrier, is discussed. Then, the methods that have been used to quantify PET data of the P-gp tracers [11C]verapamil, [11C]N-desmetyl-loperamide (dLop), [11C]laniquidar, [11C]phenytoin, [11C]tariquidar and [11C]elacridar are reviewed.

[11C]tropanyl benzilate-binding to muscarinic cholinergic receptors: methodology and kinetic modeling alternatives,"R A Koeppe, K A Frey, G K Mulholland, M R Kilbourn, A Buck, K S Lee, D E Kuhl","Quantitative estimation of cerebral muscarinic receptors was investigated with the use of the antagonist [11C]tropanyl benzilate ([11C]TRB) and positron emission tomography (PET). Kinetic modeling alternatives were examined with the goal of identifying an analysis method providing stable receptor measures, yet avoiding biases from inappropriate reductions in model complexity. Dynamic PET scans were performed on six young normal volunteers. Several modeling approaches yielding relative receptor density measures were evaluated: (a) a single ""late"" scan using relative tracer concentration values; (b) a slope estimate from graphic analysis (Patlak plot); (c) a two-compartment, two-parameter model (transport and total ligand distribution volume); (d) a three-compartment, two-parameter model using the free+nonspecific distribution volume, DV', fixed to the cerebellar value; (e) an early scan for transport, a fixed value for DV', and a single late scan for the binding rate constant; and (f) a three-compartment, three-parameter model. Both computer simulations and PET scan results indicate all methods provide receptor density index measures with the same rank order as in vitro measures. Oversimplified approaches (methods 1 and 2) yield a more highly nonlinear relation between the estimated receptor density index and the known receptor density than do methods retaining greater model complexity (methods 3-6). However, noise propagation into the receptor measure is greater for the more complex methods. Reliable receptor density information can be obtained from kinetic [11C]TRB PET studies, with methods 3-5 providing the most appropriate levels of model complexity for estimates of relative muscarinic receptor density.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8263062/
Direct parametric reconstruction in dynamic PET myocardial perfusion imaging: in vivo studies,"Yoann Petibon, Yothin Rakvongthai, Georges El Fakhri, Jinsong Ouyang","Dynamic PET myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) used in conjunction with tracer kinetic modeling enables the quantification of absolute myocardial blood flow (MBF). However, MBF maps computed using the traditional indirect method (i.e. post-reconstruction voxel-wise fitting of kinetic model to PET time-activity-curves-TACs) suffer from poor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Direct reconstruction of kinetic parameters from raw PET projection data has been shown to offer parametric images with higher SNR compared to the indirect method. The aim of this study was to extend and evaluate the performance of a direct parametric reconstruction method using in vivo dynamic PET MPI data for the purpose of quantifying MBF. Dynamic PET MPI studies were performed on two healthy pigs using a Siemens Biograph mMR scanner. List-mode PET data for each animal were acquired following a bolus injection of ~7-8 mCi of18F-flurpiridaz, a myocardial perfusion agent. Fully-3D dynamic PET sinograms were obtained by sorting the coincidence events into 16 temporal frames covering ~5 min after radiotracer administration. Additionally, eight independent noise realizations of both scans-each containing 1/8th of the total number of events-were generated from the original list-mode data. Dynamic sinograms were then used to compute parametric maps using the conventional indirect method and the proposed direct method. For both methods, a one-tissue compartment model accounting for spillover from the left and right ventricle blood-pools was used to describe the kinetics of18F-flurpiridaz. An image-derived arterial input function obtained from a TAC taken in the left ventricle cavity was used for tracer kinetic analysis. For the indirect method, frame-by-frame images were estimated using two fully-3D reconstruction techniques: the standard ordered subset expectation maximization (OSEM) reconstruction algorithm on one side, and the one-step late maximum a posteriori (OSL-MAP) algorithm on the other side, which incorporates a quadratic penalty function. The parametric images were then calculated using voxel-wise weighted least-square fitting of the reconstructed myocardial PET TACs. For the direct method, parametric images were estimated directly from the dynamic PET sinograms using a maximum a posteriori (MAP) parametric reconstruction algorithm which optimizes an objective function comprised of the Poisson log-likelihood term, the kinetic model and a quadratic penalty function. Maximization of the objective function with respect to each set of parameters was achieved using a preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithm with a specifically developed pre-conditioner. The performance of the direct method was evaluated by comparing voxel- and segment-wise estimates of [Formula: see text], the tracer transport rate (ml · min-1· ml-1), to those obtained using the indirect method applied to both OSEM and OSL-MAP dynamic reconstructions. The proposed direct reconstruction method produced [Formula: see text] maps with visibly lower noise than the indirect method based on OSEM and OSL-MAP reconstructions. At normal count levels, the direct method was shown to outperform the indirect method based on OSL-MAP in the sense that at matched level of bias, reduced regional noise levels were obtained. At lower count levels, the direct method produced [Formula: see text] estimates with significantly lower standard deviation across noise realizations than the indirect method based on OSL-MAP at matched bias level. In all cases, the direct method yielded lower noise and standard deviation than the indirect method based on OSEM. Overall, the proposed direct reconstruction offered a better bias-variance tradeoff than the indirect method applied to either OSEM and OSL-MAP. Direct parametric reconstruction as applied to in vivo dynamic PET MPI data is therefore a promising method for producing MBF maps with lower variance.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28379843/
An analysis of whole body tracer kinetics in dynamic PET studies with application to image-based blood input function extraction,"Jian Huang, Finbarr O'Sullivan","In a positron emission tomography (PET) study, the local uptake of the tracer is dependent on vascular delivery and retention. For dynamic studies the measured uptake time-course information can be best interpreted when knowledge of the time-course of tracer in the blood is available. This is certainly true for the most established tracers such as 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and 15O-Water (H2O). Since direct sampling of blood as part of PET studies is increasingly impractical, there is ongoing interest in image-extraction of blood time-course information. But analysis of PET-measured blood pool signals is complicated because they will typically involve a combination of arterial, venous and tissue information. Thus, a careful appreciation of these components is needed to interpret the available data. To facilitate this process, we propose a novel Markov chain model for representation of the circulation of a tracer atom in the body. The model represents both arterial and venous time-course patterns. Under reasonable conditions equilibration of tracer activity in arterial and venous blood is achieved by the end of the PET study-consistent with empirical measurement. Statistical inference for Markov model parameters is a challenge. A penalized nonlinear least squares process, incorporating a generalized cross-validation score, is proposed. Random effects analysis is used to adaptively specify the structure of the penalty function based on historical samples of directly measured blood data. A collection of arterially sampled data from PET studies with FDG and H2O is used to illustrate the methodology. These data analyses are highly supportive of the overall modeling approach. An adaptation of the model to the problem of extraction of arterial blood signals from imaging data is also developed and promising preliminary results for cerebral and thoracic imaging studies with FDG and H2O are obtained.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24770914/
PET Imaging Evaluation of Four σ1 Radiotracers in Nonhuman Primates,"Evan Baum, Zhengxin Cai, Frederic Bois, Daniel Holden, Shu-Fei Lin, Teresa Lara-Jaime, Michael Kapinos, Yuanyuan Chen, Winnie Deuther-Conrad, Steffen Fischer, Sladjana Dukic-Stefanovic, Paul Bunse, Bernhard Wünsch, Peter Brust, Hongmei Jia, Yiyun Huang","The σ1receptors (S1Rs) are implicated in a variety of diseases including Alzheimer disease and cancer. Previous PET S1R radiotracers are characterized by slow kinetics or off-target binding that impedes their use in humans. Here, we report the first PET imaging evaluation in rhesus monkeys of 418F-labeled spirocyclic piperidine-based PET radiotracers (18F-1to18F-4).Methods:Baseline scans for the 4 radiotracers were obtained on an adult male rhesus monkey. Blocking scans were obtained with the S1R-selective agonist SA4503 to assess binding specificity of18F-2and18F-4Arterial input functions were measured, and binding parameters were determined with kinetic modeling analysis.Results:In the rhesus brain, all 4 radiotracers showed high and fast uptake. Tissue activity washout was rapid for18F-2and18F-4, and much slower for18F-1and18F-3, in line with their respective in vitro S1R-binding affinities. Both the 1-tissue-compartment and multilinear analysis-1 kinetic models provided good fits of time-activity curves and reliable estimates of distribution volume. Regional distribution volume values were highest in the cingulate cortex and lowest in the thalamus for all radiotracers.18F-4showed greater differential uptake across brain regions and 3-fold-higher binding potential than18F-2SA4503 at the dose of 0.5 mg/kg blocked approximately 85% (18F-2) and 95% (18F-4) of radiotracer binding.Conclusion:Tracers18F-2and18F-4displayed high brain uptake and fast tissue kinetics, with18F-4having higher specific binding signals than18F-2in the same monkey. Taken together, these data indicate that both18F-2and18F-4possess the requisite kinetic and imaging properties as viable PET tracers for imaging S1R in the human brain.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28232607/
In vivo evaluation of [18F]FEAnGA-Me: a PET tracer for imaging β-glucuronidase (β-GUS) activity in a tumor/inflammation rodent model,"Inês F Antunes, Hidde J Haisma, Philip H Elsinga, Jurgen W A Sijbesma, Aren van Waarde, Antoon T M Willemsen, Rudi A Dierckx, Erik F J de Vries","Introduction: The PET tracer, 1-O-(4-(2-fluoroethyl-carbamoyloxymethyl)-2-nitrophenyl)-O-β-d-glucopyronuronate ([(18)F]FEAnGA), was recently developed for PET imaging of extracellular β-glucuronidase (β-GUS). However, [(18)F]FEAnGA exhibited rapid renal clearance, which resulted in a relatively low tracer uptake in the tumor. To improve the pharmacokinetics of [(18)F]FEAnGA, we developed its more lipophilic methyl ester analog, [(18)F]FEAnGA-Me.

Methods: [(18)F]FEAnGA-Me was obtained by alkylation of the O-protected glucuronide methyl ester precursor with [(18)F]-fluoroethylamine ([(18)F]FEA), followed by removal of the acetate protecting groups with NaOMe/MeOH. The PET tracer was evaluated by in vitro and in vivo studies.

Results: [(18)F]FEAnGA-Me was obtained in 5%-10% overall radiochemical yield. It is 10-fold less hydrophilic than [(18)F]FEAnGA and it is stable in PBS and in the presence of β-GUS for 1 h. However, in the presence of esterase or plasma [(18)F]FEAnGA-Me is converted to [(18)F]FEAnGA, and subsequently converted to [(18)F]FEA by β-GUS. MicroPET studies in Wistar rats bearing a C6 glioma and a sterile inflammation showed similar uptake in tumors after injection of either [(18)F]FEAnGA-Me or [(18)F]FEAnGA. Both tracers had a rapid two-phase clearance of total plasma radioactivity with a half-life of 1 and 8 min. The [(18)F]FEAnGA fraction generated from [(18)F]FEAnGA-Me by in vivo hydrolysis had a circulation half-life of 1 and 11 min in plasma. Similar distribution volume in the viable part of the tumor was found after injection of either [(18)F]FEAnGA-Me or [(18)F]FEAnGA.

Conclusion: The imaging properties of [(18)F]FEAnGA-Me were not significantly better than those of [(18)F]FEAnGA. Therefore, other strategies should be applied in order to improve the kinetics of these tracers.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22445742/
Kinetic modeling of receptor-ligand binding applied to positron emission tomographic studies with neuroleptic tracers,"J Logan, A P Wolf, C Y Shiue, J S Fowler","Positron emission tomography (PET) with labeled neuroleptics has made possible the study of neurotransmitter-receptor systems in vivo. In this study we investigate the kinetics of the 3,4-dihydroxyphenylethylamine (dopamine) receptor-ligand binding using PET data from a series of experiments in the baboon with the 18F-labeled drugs spiperone, haloperidol, and benperidol. Models used to describe these systems are based on first-order kinetics which applies at high specific activity (low receptor occupancy). The parameters governing the uptake and loss of drug from the brain were found by fitting PET data from regions with little or no receptor concentration (cerebellum) and from experiments in which specific binding was blocked by pretreatment with the drug (+)-butaclamol. Receptor constants were determined by fitting data from receptor-containing structures. Correcting the arterial plasma activities (the model driving function) for the presence of drug metabolites was found to be important in the modeling of these systems.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2432176/
Modelling of FDG metabolism in liver voxels,"C Baker, N Dowson, P Thomas, S Rose","Kinetic analysis is a tool used to glean additional information from positron emission tomography (PET) data by exploiting the dynamics of tissue metabolism. The standard irreversible and reversible two compartment models used in kinetic analysis were initially developed to analyse brain PET data. The application of kinetic analysis to PET of the liver presents the opportunity to move beyond the generic standard models and develop physiologically informed pharmacokinetic models that incorporate structural and functional features in particular to the liver. In this paper, we develop a new compartment model, called the tubes model, which is informed by the liver׳s sinusoidal architecture, high fractional blood volume, high perfusion rate, and large hepatocyte surface area facing the space of Disse. The tubes model distributes tracer between the blood and intracellular compartments in more physiologically faithful proportions than the standard model, producing parametric images with improved contrast between healthy and neoplastic tissue.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25451530/
Does quantification of [11C]meta-hydroxyephedrine and [13N]ammonia kinetics improve risk stratification in ischemic cardiomyopathy,"Jean Z Wang, Jason G E Zelt, Nicole Kaps, Aaryn Lavallee, Jennifer M Renaud, Benjamin Rotstein, Rob S B Beanlands, James A Fallavollita, John M Canty Jr, Robert A deKemp","Background: In ischemic cardiomyopathy patients, cardiac sympathetic nervous system dysfunction is a predictor of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA). This study compared abnormal innervation and perfusion measured by [11C]meta-hydroxyephedrine (HED) vs [13N]ammonia (NH3), conventional uptake vs parametric tracer analysis, and their SCA risk discrimination.

Methods: This is a sub-study analysis of the prospective PAREPET trial, which followed ischemic cardiomyopathy patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF ≤ 35%) for events of SCA. Using n = 174 paired dynamic HED and NH3positron emission tomography (PET) scans, regional defect scores (%LV extent × severity) were calculated using HED and NH3uptake, as well as HED distribution volume and NH3myocardial blood flow by kinetic modeling.

Results: During 4.1 years follow-up, there were 27 SCA events. HED defects were larger than NH3, especially in the lowest tertile of perfusion abnormality (P < .001). Parametric defects were larger than their respective tracer uptake defects (P < .001). SCA risk discrimination was not significantly improved with parametric or uptake mismatch (AUC = 0.73 or 0.70) compared to HED uptake defect scores (AUC = 0.67).

Conclusion: Quantification of HED distribution volume and NH3myocardial blood flow produced larger defects than their respective measures of tracer uptake, but did not lead to improved SCA risk stratification vs HED uptake alone.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34341953/
Kinetic compartment modeling of [11C]-5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan for positron emission tomography assessment of serotonin synthesis in human brain,"Gisela E Hagberg, Richard Torstenson, Ina Marteinsdottir, Mats Fredrikson, Bengt Långström, Gunnar Blomqvist","The substrate for the second enzymatic step in serotonin synthesis, 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan, labeled in the beta-position ([11C]-HTP), was used for positron emission tomography (PET) measurements in six healthy human participants, examined on two occasions. One- and two-tissue kinetic compartment modeling of time-radioactivity curves was performed, using arterial, metabolite-corrected [11C]-HTP values as input function. The availability of unchanged tracer in arterial blood plasma was > or = 80% up to 60 minutes after injection, while [11C]-hydroxyindole acetic acid and [11C]-serotonin accounted for the remaining radioactivity, amounting to < or = 16% and < or = 4%, respectively. Compartment modeling was performed for brain stem, putamen, caudate nucleus, anterior cingulate, white matter, and superior occipital, occipitotemporal, and temporal cortices. The average biologic half-life for plasma-to-tissue equilibrium was 7 to 12 minutes, and the volume of distribution was 0.2 to 0.5 microL.mL(-1). In all regions except white matter, the kinetic compartment model that included irreversible [11C]-HTP trapping showed significantly improved model fits with respect to a one-tissue compartment model. The [11C]-HTP trapping rate constant depended on the estimated tissue availability of the serotonin precursor tryptophan, known to reflect serotonin synthesis in healthy individuals, and correlated with serotonin tissue concentration and synthesis rates reported previously in literature. These findings suggest the use of [11C]-HTP PET measurements to investigate serotonin synthesis.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12439293/
Simple and rapid radiosynthesis of N-18F-labeled glutamic acid as a hepatocellular carcinoma PET tracer,"Aixia Sun, Shaoyu Liu, Xiaolan Tang, Dahong Nie, Ganghua Tang, Zhanwen Zhang, Fuhua Wen, Xiaoyan Wang","Introduction: We have reported that N-(2-18F-fluoropropionyl)-L-glutamate (18F-FPGLU) showed good tumor-to-background contrast and18F-FPGLU was prepared via complex multi-step reaction sequence; here, it is synthesized by a facile two-step reaction sequence. The objectives of this study are to synthesize18F-FPGLU via a two-step reaction sequence and to evaluate the value of18F-FPGLU in nude mice bearing human hepatocellular carcinoma SMCC-7721 (HCC SMCC-7721).

Methods: 18F-FPGLU was synthetized from the precursor (2S)-dimethyl 2-(2-bromopropanamido)pentanedioate via the two-step on-column hydrolysis using a modified commercial FDG synthesizer. To investigate the transport mechanism of18F-FPGLU, we conducted a series of competitive inhibition experiments on HCC SMCC-7721 cells in the absence or presence of Na+and various types of inhibitors. Small-animal PET-CT imaging was performed on tumor-bearing nude mice using18F-FPGLU and 2-18F-2-deoxy-D-glucose (18F-FDG).

Results: The radiochemical yield of18F-FPGLU was up to 15±5% (EOS, n=10) in 35min with the two-step procedure and the radiochemical purity was higher than 95% with a specific activity of 30-40GBq/μmol. In vitro cell experiments show that18F-FPGLU is primarily transported through the Na+-dependent system XAG- and Na+-independent system XC-. PET imaging in a tumor model indicates that18F-FPGLU may be superior to18F-FDG for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) imaging.

Conclusion: An optimized route to prepare18F-FPGLU was developed and18F-FPGLU was synthetized from the precursor ((2S)-dimethyl 2-(2-bromopropanamido)pentanedioate) via the two-step on-column hydrolysis.18F-FPGLU was a potential novel PET tracer for HCC imaging.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28301817/
"Evaluation of Dosimetry, Quantitative Methods, and Test-Retest Variability of 18F-PI-2620 PET for the Assessment of Tau Deposits in the Human Brain","Santiago Bullich, Olivier Barret, Cristian Constantinescu, Christine Sandiego, Andre Mueller, Mathias Berndt, Caroline Papin, Audrey Perrotin, Norman Koglin, Heiko Kroth, Andrea Pfeifer, Gilles Tamagnan, Jennifer Madonia, John P Seibyl, Kenneth Marek, Susan De Santi, Ludger M Dinkelborg, Andrew W Stephens","18F-PI-2620 is a next-generation tau PET tracer that has demonstrated ability to image the spatial distribution of suspected tau pathology. The objective of this study was to assess the tracer biodistribution, dosimetry, and quantitative methods of18F-PI-2620 in the human brain. Full kinetic modeling to quantify tau load was investigated. Noninvasive kinetic modeling and semiquantitative methods were evaluated against the full tracer kinetics. Finally, the reproducibility of PET measurements from test and retest scans was assessed.Methods:Three healthy controls (HCs) and 4 Alzheimer disease (AD) subjects underwent 2 dynamic PET scans, including arterial sampling. Distribution volume ratio (DVR) was estimated using full tracer kinetics (reversible 2-tissue-compartment [2TC] model and Logan graphical analysis [LGA]) and noninvasive kinetic models (noninvasive LGA [NI-LGA] and the multilinear reference tissue model [MRTM2]). SUV ratio (SUVR) was determined at different imaging windows after injection. The correlation between DVR and SUVR, effect size (Cohen's d), and test-retest variability (TRV) were evaluated. Additionally, 6 HCs received 1 tracer administration and underwent whole-body PET for dosimetry calculation. Organ doses and the whole-body effective dose were calculated using OLINDA 2.0.Results:A strong correlation was found across different kinetic models (R2> 0.97) and between DVR(2TC) and SUVR between 30 and 90 min, with anR2of more than 0.95. Secular equilibrium was reached at around 40 min after injection in most regions and subjects. TRV and effect size for SUVR across different regions were similar at 30-60 min (TRV, 3.8%; Cohen's d, 3.80), 45-75 min (TRV, 4.3%; Cohen's d, 3.77) and 60-90 min (TRV, 4.9%; Cohen's d, 3.73) and increased at later time points. Elimination was via the hepatobiliary and urinary systems. The whole-body effective dose was 33.3 ± 2.1 μSv/MBq for an adult female and 33.1 ± 1.4 μSv/MBq for an adult male, with a 1.5-h urinary bladder voiding interval.Conclusion:18F-PI-2620 exhibits fast kinetics, suitable dosimetry, and low TRV. DVR measured using the 2TC model with arterial sampling correlated strongly with DVR measured by NI-LGA, MRTM2, and SUVR. SUVR can be used for18F-PI-2620 PET quantification of tau deposits, avoiding arterial blood sampling.

Simultaneous Denoising of Dynamic PET Images Based on Deep Image Prior,"Cheng-Hsun Yang, Hsuan-Ming Huang","Parametric imaging obtained from kinetic modeling analysis of dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) data is a useful tool for quantifying tracer kinetics. However, pixel-wise time-activity curves have high noise levels which lead to poor quality of parametric images. To solve this limitation, we proposed a new image denoising method based on deep image prior (DIP). Like the original DIP method, the proposed DIP method is an unsupervised method, in which no training dataset is required. However, the difference is that our method can simultaneously denoise all dynamic PET images. Moreover, we propose a modified version of the DIP method called double DIP (DDIP), which has two DIP architectures. The additional DIP model is used to generate high-quality input data for the second DIP model. Computer simulations were performed to evaluate the performance of the proposed DIP-based methods. Our simulation results showed that the DDIP method outperformed the single DIP method. In addition, the DDIP method combined with data augmentation could generate PET parametric images with superior image quality compared to the spatiotemporal-based non-local means filtering and high constrained backprojection. Our preliminary results show that our proposed DDIP method is a novel and effective unsupervised method for simultaneously denoising dynamic PET images.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35239090/
Event-by-Event Continuous Respiratory Motion Correction for Dynamic PET Imaging,"Yunhan Yu, Chung Chan, Tianyu Ma, Yaqiang Liu, Jean-Dominique Gallezot, Mika Naganawa, Olivia J Kelada, Mary Germino, Albert J Sinusas, Richard E Carson, Chi Liu","Existing respiratory motion-correction methods are applied only to static PET imaging. We have previously developed an event-by-event respiratory motion-correction method with correlations between internal organ motion and external respiratory signals (INTEX). This method is uniquely appropriate for dynamic imaging because it corrects motion for each time point. In this study, we applied INTEX to human dynamic PET studies with various tracers and investigated the impact on kinetic parameter estimation.

Methods: The use of 3 tracers-a myocardial perfusion tracer, (82)Rb (n = 7); a pancreatic β-cell tracer, (18)F-FP(+)DTBZ (n = 4); and a tumor hypoxia tracer, (18)F-fluoromisonidazole ((18)F-FMISO) (n = 1)-was investigated in a study of 12 human subjects. Both rest and stress studies were performed for (82)Rb. The Anzai belt system was used to record respiratory motion. Three-dimensional internal organ motion in high temporal resolution was calculated by INTEX to guide event-by-event respiratory motion correction of target organs in each dynamic frame. Time-activity curves of regions of interest drawn based on end-expiration PET images were obtained. For (82)Rb studies, K1 was obtained with a 1-tissue model using a left-ventricle input function. Rest-stress myocardial blood flow (MBF) and coronary flow reserve (CFR) were determined. For (18)F-FP(+)DTBZ studies, the total volume of distribution was estimated with arterial input functions using the multilinear analysis 1 method. For the (18)F-FMISO study, the net uptake rate Ki was obtained with a 2-tissue irreversible model using a left-ventricle input function. All parameters were compared with the values derived without motion correction.

Results: With INTEX, K1 and MBF increased by 10% ± 12% and 15% ± 19%, respectively, for (82)Rb stress studies. CFR increased by 19% ± 21%. For studies with motion amplitudes greater than 8 mm (n = 3), K1, MBF, and CFR increased by 20% ± 12%, 30% ± 20%, and 34% ± 23%, respectively. For (82)Rb rest studies, INTEX had minimal effect on parameter estimation. The total volume of distribution of (18)F-FP(+)DTBZ and Ki of (18)F-FMISO increased by 17% ± 6% and 20%, respectively.

Conclusion: Respiratory motion can have a substantial impact on dynamic PET in the thorax and abdomen. The INTEX method using continuous external motion data substantially changed parameters in kinetic modeling. More accurate estimation is expected with INTEX.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26912437/
Impact of tissue transport on PET hypoxia quantification in pancreatic tumours,"Edward Taylor, Jennifer Gottwald, Ivan Yeung, Harald Keller, Michael Milosevic, Neesha C Dhani, Iram Siddiqui, David W Hedley, David A Jaffray","Background: The clinical impact of hypoxia in solid tumours is indisputable and yet questions about the sensitivity of hypoxia-PET imaging have impeded its uptake into routine clinical practice. Notably, the binding rate of hypoxia-sensitive PET tracers is slow, comparable to the rate of diffusive equilibration in some tissue types, including mucinous and necrotic tissue. This means that tracer uptake on the scale of a PET imaging voxel-large enough to include such tissue and hypoxic cells-can be as much determined by tissue transport properties as it is by hypoxia. Dynamic PET imaging of 20 patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma was used to assess the impact of transport on surrogate metrics of hypoxia: the tumour-to-blood ratio [TBR(t)] at time t post-tracer injection and the trapping rate k3inferred from a two-tissue compartment model. Transport quantities obtained from this model included the vascular influx and efflux rate coefficients, k1and k2, and the distribution volume vd≡k1/(k2+k3).

Results: Correlations between voxel- and whole tumour-scale k3and TBR values were weak to modest: the population average of the Pearson correlation coefficients (r) between voxel-scale k3and TBR (1 h) [TBR(2 h)] values was 0.10 [0.01] in the 20 patients, while the correlation between tumour-scale k3and TBR(2 h) values was 0.58. Using Patlak's formula to correct uptake for the distribution volume, correlations became strong (r=0.80[0.52] and r=0.93, respectively). The distribution volume was substantially below unity for a large fraction of tumours studied, with vdranging from 0.68 to 1 (population average, 0.85). Surprisingly, k3values were strongly correlated with vdin all patients. A model was proposed to explain this in which k3is a combination of the hypoxia-sensitive tracer binding rate kband the rate keqof equilibration in slow-equilibrating regions occupying a volume fraction 1-vdof the imaged tissue. This model was used to calculate the proposed hypoxia surrogate marker kb.

Conclusions: Hypoxia-sensitive PET tracers are slow to reach diffusive equilibrium in a substantial fraction of pancreatic tumours, confounding quantification of hypoxia using both static (TBR) and dynamic (k3) PET imaging. TBR is reduced by distribution volume effects and k3is enhanced by slow equilibration. We proposed a novel model to quantify tissue transport properties and hypoxia-sensitive tracer binding in order to improve the sensitivity of hypoxia-PET imaging.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29273939/
First experiences with dynamic renal [68Ga]Ga-DOTA PET/CT: a comparison to renal scintigraphy and compartmental modelling to non-invasively estimate the glomerular filtration rate,"David Kersting, Miriam Sraieb, Robert Seifert, Pedro Fragoso Costa, Sandra Kazek, Lukas Kessler, Lale Umutlu, Wolfgang Peter Fendler, Walter Jentzen, Ken Herrmann, Florian Büther, Michael Nader, Christoph Rischpler","Purpose: The determination of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is decisive for a variety of clinical issues, for example, to monitor the renal function in radionuclide therapy patients. Renal scintigraphy using glomerularly filtered tracers allows combined acquisition of renograms and GFR estimation but requires repeated blood sampling for several hours. In contrast, dynamic PET imaging using the glomerularly filtered tracer [68Ga]Ga-DOTA bears the potential to non-invasively estimate the GFR by compartmental kinetic modelling. Here, we report the, to our knowledge, first comparison of human renal dynamic [68Ga]Ga-DOTA PET imaging in comparison to renal scintigraphy and compare PET-derived to serum creatinine-derived GFR measurements.

Methods: Dynamic [68Ga]Ga-DOTA PET data were acquired for 30 min immediately after tracer injection in 12 patients. PET and renal scintigraphy images were visually interpreted in a consensus read by three nuclear medicine physicians. The functional renal cortex was segmented to obtain time-activity curves. The arterial input function was estimated from the PET signal in the abdominal aorta. Single-compartmental tracer kinetic modelling was performed to calculate the GFR using complete 30-min (GFRPET-30) and reduced 15-min PET data sets (GFRPET-15) to evaluate whether a shorter acquisition time is sufficient for an accurate GFR estimation. A modified approach excluding minutes 2 to 10 was applied to reduce urinary spill-over effects. Serum creatinine-derived GFRCKD(CKD-EPI-formula) was used as reference standard.

Results: PET image interpretation revealed the same findings as conventional scintigraphy (2/12 patients with both- and 1/12 patients with right-sided urinary obstruction). Model fit functions were substantially improved for the modified approach to exclude spill-over. Depending on the modelling approach, GFRCKDand both GFRPET-30and GFRPET-15were well correlated with interclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) from 0.74 to 0.80 and Pearson's correlation coefficients (PCCs) from 0.74 to 0.81. For a subgroup of patients with undisturbed urinary efflux (n = 9), correlations were good to excellent (ICCs from 0.82 to 0.95 and PCCs from 0.83 to 0.95). Overall, GFRPET-30and GFRPET-15were excellently correlated (ICCs from 0.96 to 0.99 and PCCs from 0.96 to 0.99).

Conclusion: Renal [68Ga]Ga-DOTA PET can be a suitable alternative to conventional scintigraphy. Visual assessment of PET images and conventional renograms revealed comparable results. GFR values derived by non-invasive single-compartmental-modelling of PET data show a good correlation to serum creatinine-derived GFR values. In patients with undisturbed urinary efflux, the correlation was excellent. Dynamic PET data acquisition for 15 min is sufficient for visual evaluation and GFR derivation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35412053/
Parametric imaging and quantitative analysis of the PET amyloid ligand [(18)F]flutemetamol,"Kerstin Heurling, Chris Buckley, Koen Van Laere, Rik Vandenberghe, Mark Lubberink","Objectives: The amyloid imaging PET tracer [(18)F]flutemetamol was recently approved by regulatory authorities in the US and EU for estimation of β-amyloid neuritic plaque density in cognitively impaired patients. While the clinical assessment in line with the label is a qualitative visual assessment of 20 min summation images, the aim of this work was to assess the performance of various parametric analysis methods and standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR), in comparison with arterial input based compartment modeling.

Methods: The cerebellar cortex was used as reference region in the generation of parametric images of binding potential (BPND) using multilinear reference tissue methods (MRTMo, MRTM, MRTM2), basis function implementations of the simplified reference tissue model (here called RPM) and the two-parameter version of SRTM (here called RPM2) and reference region based Logan graphical analysis. Regionally averaged values of parametric results were compared with the BPND of corresponding regions from arterial input compartment modeling. Dynamic PET data were also pre-filtered using a 3D Gaussian smoothing of 5mm FWHM and the effect of the filtering on the correlation was investigated. In addition, the use of SUVR images was evaluated. The accuracy of several kinetic models were also assessed through simulations of time-activity curves based on clinical data for low and high binding adding different levels of statistical noise representing regions and individual voxels.

Results: The highest correlation was observed for pre-filtered reference Logan, with correction for individual reference region efflux rate constant k2' (R(2)=0.98), or using a cohort mean k2' (R(2)=0.97). Pre-processing filtered MRTM2, unfiltered SUVR over the scanning window 70-90 min and unfiltered RPM also demonstrated high correlations with arterial input compartment modeling (MRTM2 R(2)=0.97, RPM R(2)=0.96 and SUVR R(2)=0.95) Poorest agreement was seen with MRTM without pre-filtering (R(2)=0.68).

Conclusions: Parametric imaging allows for quantification without introducing bias due to selection of anatomical regions, and thus enables objective statistical voxel-based comparisons of tracer binding. Several parametric modeling approaches perform well, especially after Gaussian pre-filtering of the dynamic data. However, the semi-quantitative use of SUVR between 70 and 90 min has comparable agreement with full kinetic modeling, thus supporting its use as a simplified method for quantitative assessment of tracer uptake.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26209803/
Design and utilisation of protocols to characterise dynamic PET uptake of two tracers using basis pursuit,"Christopher Bell, Simon Puttick, Stephen Rose, Jye Smith, Paul Thomas, Nicholas Dowson","Imaging using more than one biological process using PET could be of great utility, but despite previously proposed approaches to dual-tracer imaging, it is seldom performed. The alternative of performing multiple scans is often infeasible for clinical practice or even in research studies. Dual-tracer PET scanning allows for multiple PET radiotracers to be imaged within the same imaging session. In this paper we describe our approach to utilise the basis pursuit method to aid in the design of dual-tracer PET imaging experiments, and later in separation of the signals. The advantage of this approach is that it does not require a compartment model architecture to be specified or even that both signals are distinguishable in all cases. This means the method for separating dual-tracer signals can be used for many feasible and useful combinations of biology or radiotracer, once an appropriate scanning protocol has been decided upon. Following a demonstration in separating the signals from two consecutively injected radionuclides in a controlled experiment, phantom and list-mode mouse experiments demonstrated the ability to test the feasibility of dual-tracer imaging protocols for multiple injection delays. Increases in variances predicted for kinetic macro-parameters VDand KIin brain and tumoral tissue were obtained when separating the synthetically combined data. These experiments confirmed previous work using other approaches that injections delays of 10-20 min ensured increases in variance were kept minimal for the test tracers used. On this basis, an actual dual-tracer experiment using a 20 min delay was performed using these radio tracers, with the kinetic parameters (VDand KI) extracted for each tracer in agreement with the literature. This study supports previous work that dual-tracer PET imaging can be accomplished provided certain constraints are adhered to. The utilisation of basis pursuit techniques, with its removed need to specify a model architecture, allows the feasibility of a range of imaging protocols to be investigated via simulation in a straight-forward manner for a wide range of possible scenarios. The hope is that the ease of utilising this approach during feasibility studies and in practice removes any perceived technical barrier to performing dual-tracer imaging.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28375137/
Quantitative 18F-fluorocholine positron emission tomography for prostate cancer: correlation between kinetic parameters and Gleason scoring,"Joshua D Schaefferkoetter, Ziting Wang, Mary C Stephenson, Sharmili Roy, Maurizio Conti, Lars Eriksson, David W Townsend, Thomas Thamboo, Edmund Chiong","Background: The use of radiolabeled choline as a positron emission tomography (PET) agent for imaging primary tumors in the prostate has been evaluated extensively over the past two decades. There are, however, conflicting reports of its sensitivity and the relationship between choline PET imaging and disease staging is not fully understood. Moreover, relatively few studies have investigated the correlation between tracer uptake and histological tumor grade. This work quantified18F-fluorocholine in tumor and healthy prostate tissue using pharmacokinetic modeling and stratified uptake parameters by histology grade. Additionally, the effect of scan time on the estimation of the kinetic exchange rate constants was evaluated, and the tracer influx parameters from full compartmental analysis were compared to uptake values quantified by Patlak and standardized uptake value (SUV) analyses.18F-fluorocholine was administered as a 222 MBq bolus injection to ten patients with biopsy-confirmed prostate tumors, and dynamic PET data were acquired for 60 min. Image-derived arterial input functions were scaled by discrete blood samples, and a 2-tissue, 4-parameter model accounting for blood volume (2T4k+Vb) was used to perform fully quantitative compartmental modeling on tumor, healthy prostate, and muscle tissue. Subsequently, all patients underwent radical prostatectomy, and histological analyses were performed on the prostate specimens; kinetic parameters for tumors were stratified by Gleason score. Correlations were investigated between compartmental K1and Kiparameters and SUV and Patlak slope; the effect of scan time on parameter bias was also evaluated.

Results: Choline activity curves in seven tumors, eight healthy prostate regions, and nine muscle regions were analyzed. Net tracer influx was generally higher in tumor relative to healthy prostate, with the values in the highest grade tumors markedly higher than those in lower grade tumors. Influx terms from Patlak and full compartmental modeling showed good correlation within individual tissue groups. Kinetic parameters calculated from the entire 60-min scan data were accurately reproduced from the first 30 min of acquired data (R2≈ 0.9).

Conclusions: Strong correlations were observed between Kiand Patlak slope in tumor tissue, and K1and SUV were also correlated but to a lesser degree. Reliable estimates of all kinetic parameters can be achieved from the first 30 min of dynamic18F-choline data. Although SUV, K1, Ki, and Patlak slope were found to be poor differentiators of low-grade tumor compared to healthy prostate tissue, they are strong indicators of aggressive disease.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28324340/
Criteria for the tracer kinetic measurement of cerebral protein synthesis in humans with positron emission tomography,"M E Phelps, J R Barrio, S C Huang, R E Keen, H Chugani, J C Mazziotta","The principles and initial results of the use of PET to measure the local cerebral metabolic rate for protein synthesis ( lCRPS ) in humans are described. The labeling of leucine, phenylalanine, and methionine in the carboxyl position provides a strategy (selective position labeling) for discriminating between the incorporation of these amino acids into proteins and metabolic oxidation. In metabolic oxidation the label is removed from tissue through decarboxylation. The resulting labeled carbon dioxide is diluted by the tissue carbon dioxide pool, cleared from cerebral tissue by blood flow, and subsequently ventilated by the lungs. This approach also provides a plasma input function that is free of other labeled amino acids produced through systemic reactions, such as those that occur for methionine labeled in the methyl group. The measured lCRPS is in good agreement with values determined by Smith and Sokoloff by autoradiographic and biochemical assay techniques, as are the measured kinetic rate constants of bidirectional transport, incorporation into proteins, and metabolism, as determined in monkeys and humans using L-leucine labeled with carbon-11 in position 1 (L-[1-11C]leucine) with PET. The tissue leucine precursor pool exhibits a rapid turnover rate (1.5 to 2 minutes), while the metabolic pathway has a half-time (about 18 minutes) that is close to the radioactive half-life of carbon-11. The dietary state was found to affect the branching ratio of lCRPS /metabolism, with a fasted value of 0.4 and carbohydrate feed values ranging up to 1.7. The principle of the method appears sound, and a first-order model provides good fits to data, but much more work is required to determine and validate the model structure and to optimize the study conditions and estimation criteria.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6611122/
Reproducibility of [18F]MK-6240 kinetics in brain studies with shortened dynamic PET protocol in healthy/cognitively normal subjects,"Phelipi N Schuck, Xiuyuan H Wang, Emily B Tanzi, Sally Xie, Yi Li, Sadek A Nehmeh","Background: [18F]MK-6240 is a neurofibrillary tangles PET radiotracer that has been broadly used in aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD) studies. Majority of [18F]MK-6240 PET studies use dynamic acquisitions longer than 60 min to assess the tracer kinetic parameters. As of today, no consensus has been established on the optimum dynamic PET scan time. In this study, we assess the reproducibility of [18F]MK-6240 quantitative metrics using shortest dynamic PET protocols in cognitively normal subjects. PET metrics were measured through two-tissue compartment model (2TCM) and Logan model to estimate VT and DVR, as well as SUVR from 90 to 120 min (SUVR90 - 120 min) post-tracer injection for brain regions. 2TCM was carried out using the 120 min dynamic coffee break dataset (first scan from 0 to 60 min p.i., second scan from 90 to 120 min p.i.) and then repeated after stepwise shortening it by 5 min. The dynamic scan length that reproduced the 120 min dynamic scans-based VT to within 10% error was defined as the shortest acquisition time (SAT). The SAT SUVR90 - 120 minwas deduced from the SAT dataset by extrapolation of each image pixel time-activity curve to 120 min. The reproducibility of the 120 min dynamic scans-based VT2TCM, DVR2TCM, DVRLogan, and SUVR using the SAT was assessed using Passing-Bablock analysis. The limits of reproducibility of each PET metrics were determined using Bland-Altman analysis.

Results: A dynamic SAT of 40 min yielded < 10% error in [18F]MK-6240 VT2TCM's for all brain regions, compared to those measured using the 120 min datasets. SAT-based analysis did not show statistically significant systemic or proportional biases in VT2TCM, DVR2TCM, DVRLogan, or SUVR compared to those deduced from the full dynamic dataset of 120 min. A mean difference between the 120 min- and SAT-based analysis of less than 4%, 10%, 15%, and 20% existed in the VT2TCM, DVR2TCM, DVRLogan, and SUVR respectively.

Conclusion: Kinetic modeling of [18F]MK-6240 PET can be accurately performed using dynamic scan times as short as 40 min. This can facilitate studies with [18F]MK-6240 PET and improve patients accrual. Further work would be necessary to confirm the reproducibility of these results for patients in dementia spectra.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39331199/
Blood-brain barrier penetration of zolmitriptan--modelling of positron emission tomography data,"Mats Bergström, Roger Yates, Anders Wall, Matts Kågedal, Stina Syvänen, Bengt Långström","Positron emission tomography (PET) with the drug radiolabelled allows a direct measurement of brain or other organ kinetics, information which can be essential in drug development. Usually, however, a PET-tracer is administered intravenously (i.v.), whereas the therapeutic drug is mostly given orally or by a different route to the PET-tracer. In such cases, a recalculation is needed to make the PET data representative for the alternative administration route. To investigate the blood-brain barrier penetration of a drug (zolmitriptan) using dynamic PET and by PK modelling quantify the brain concentration of the drug after the nasal administration of a therapeutic dose. [11C]Zolmitriptan at tracer dose was administered as a short i.v. infusion and the brain tissue and venous blood kinetics of [11C]zolmitriptan was measured by PET in 7 healthy volunteers. One PET study was performed before and one 30 min after the administration of 5 mg zolmitriptan as nasal spray. At each of the instances, the brain radioactivity concentration after subtraction of the vascular component was determined up to 90 min after administration and compared to venous plasma radioactivity concentration after correction for radiolabelled metabolites. Convolution methods were used to describe the relationship between arterial and venous tracer concentrations, respectively between brain and arterial tracer concentration. Finally, the impulse response functions derived from the PET studies were applied on plasma PK data to estimate the brain zolmitriptan concentration after a nasal administration of a therapeutic dose. The studies shows that the PET data on brain kinetics could well be described as the convolution of venous tracer kinetics with an impulse response including terms for arterial-to-venous plasma and arterial-to-brain impulse responses. Application of the PET derived impulse responses on the plasma PK from nasal administration demonstrated that brain PK of zolmitriptan increased with time, achieving about 0.5 mg/ml at 30 min and close to a maximum of 1.5 mg/ml after 2 hr. A significant brain concentration was observed already after 5 min. The data support the notation of a rapid brain availability of zolmitriptan after nasal administration.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16402287/
Dual acquisition of (18)F-FMISO and (18)F-FDOPA,"Christopher Bell, Stephen Rose, Simon Puttick, Alex Pagnozzi, Christopher M Poole, Yaniv Gal, Paul Thomas, Michael Fay, Rosalind L Jeffree, Nicholas Dowson","Metabolic imaging using positron emission tomography (PET) has found increasing clinical use for the management of infiltrating tumours such as glioma. However, the heterogeneous biological nature of tumours and intrinsic treatment resistance in some regions means that knowledge of multiple biological factors is needed for effective treatment planning. For example, the use of (18)F-FDOPA to identify infiltrative tumour and (18)F-FMISO for localizing hypoxic regions. Performing multiple PET acquisitions is impractical in many clinical settings, but previous studies suggest multiplexed PET imaging could be viable. The fidelity of the two signals is affected by the injection interval, scan timing and injected dose. The contribution of this work is to propose a framework to explicitly trade-off signal fidelity with logistical constraints when designing the imaging protocol. The particular case of estimating (18)F-FMISO from a single frame prior to injection of (18)F-FDOPA is considered. Theoretical experiments using simulations for typical biological scenarios in humans demonstrate that results comparable to a pair of single-tracer acquisitions can be obtained provided protocol timings are carefully selected. These results were validated using a pre-clinical data set that was synthetically multiplexed. The results indicate that the dual acquisition of (18)F-FMISO and (18)F-FDOPA could be feasible in the clinical setting. The proposed framework could also be used to design protocols for other tracers.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24958083/
A tracer kinetic model for 18F-FHBG for quantitating herpes simplex virus type 1 thymidine kinase reporter gene expression in living animals using PET,"Leeta Alison Green, Khoi Nguyen, Bijan Berenji, Meera Iyer, Eileen Bauer, Jorge R Barrio, Mohammad Namavari, Nagichettiar Satyamurthy, Sanjiv S Gambhir","Reporter probe 9-(4-18F-fluoro-3-[hydroxymethyl]butyl)guanine (18F-FHBG) and reporter gene mutant herpes simplex virus type 1 thymidine kinase (HSV1-sr39tk) have been used for imaging reporter gene expression with PET. Current methods for quantitating the images using the percentage injected dose per gram of tissue do not distinguish between the effects of probe transport and subsequent phosphorylation. We therefore investigated tracer kinetic models for 18F-FHBG dynamic microPET data and noninvasive methods for determining blood time-activity curves in an adenoviral gene delivery model in mice.

Methods: 18F-FHBG (approximately 7.4 MBq [approximately 200 microCi]) was injected into 4 mice; 18F-FHBG concentrations in plasma and whole blood were measured from mouse heart left ventricle (LV) direct sampling. Replication-incompetent adenovirus (0-2 x 10(9) plaque-forming units) with the E1 region deleted (n = 8) or replaced by HSV1-sr39tk (n = 18) was tail-vein injected into mice. Mice were dynamically scanned using microPET (approximately 7.4 MBq [approximately 200 microCi] 18F-FHBG) over 1 h; regions of interest were drawn on images of the heart and liver. Serial whole blood 18F-FHBG concentrations were measured in 6 of the mice by LV sampling, and 1 least-squares ratio of the heart image to the LV time-activity curve was calculated for all 6 mice. For 2 control mice and 9 mice expressing HSV1-sr39tk, heart image (input function) and liver image time-activity curves (tissue curves) were fit to 2- and 3-compartment models using Levenberg-Marquardt nonlinear regression. The models were compared using an F statistic. HSV1-sr39TK enzyme activity was determined from liver samples and compared with model parameter estimates. For another 3 control mice and 6 HSV1-sr39TK-positive mice, the model-predicted relative percentage of metabolites was compared with high-performance liquid chromatography analysis.

Results: The ratio of 18F-FHBG in plasma to whole blood was 0.84 +/- 0.05 (mean +/- SE) by 30 s after injection. The least-squares ratio of the heart image time-activity curve to the LV time-activity curve was 0.83 +/- 0.02, consistent with the recovery coefficient for the partial-volume effect (0.81) based on independent measures of heart geometry. A 3-compartment model best described 18F-FHBG kinetics in mice expressing HSV1-sr39tk in the liver; a 2-compartment model best described the kinetics in control mice. The 3-compartment model parameter, k3, correlated well with the HSV1-sr39TK enzyme activity (r2 = 0.88).

Conclusion: 18F-FHBG equilibrates rapidly between plasma and whole blood in mice. Heart image time-activity curves corrected for partial-volume effects well approximate LV time-activity curves and can be used as input functions for 2- and 3-compartment models. The model parameter k3 from the 3-compartment model can be used as a noninvasive estimate for HSV1-sr39TK reporter protein activity and can predict the relative percentage of metabolites.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15347725/
Effect of tracer metabolism on PET measurement of [11C]pyrilamine binding to histamine H1 receptors,"S E Kim, Z Szabo, C Seki, H T Ravert, U Scheffel, R F Dannals, H N Wagner Jr","The present study was carried out to investigate the time course of [11C]pyrilamine metabolism and the degree of entry of metabolites into the brain. PET studies were performed in seven healthy volunteers and arterial plasma concentrations of [11C]pyrilamine and its labeled metabolites were determined. After intravenous injection, [11C]pyrilamine metabolized gradually in the human body, with less than 10% of plasma activity being original radioligand at 60 min. Tracer metabolism markedly affected the input function and the calculated impulse response function of the brain. Rat experiments demonstrated that although metabolites of [11C]pyrilamine might enter the brain, they were not retained for prolonged periods of time. At 30-90 min after injection of [11C]pyrilamine, less than 1% of the radioactivity in the brain was originating from metabolites of [11C]pyrilamine. Based on the rat data, the contribution of 11C-labeled metabolites to total [11C]pyrilamine radioactivity in the human brain was estimated and found to be negligible. These results suggest that the metabolites of [11C]pyrilamine do not accumulate within the cerebral extravascular space and that there is minimal metabolism of [11C]pyrilamine by brain tissue itself. Therefore, [11C]pyrilamine metabolites can be neglected in kinetic analysis, using either a compartmental or a noncompartmental model, of the [11C]pyrilamine binding to histamine H1 receptors.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10355954/
Compartmental-modelling-based measurement of murine glomerular filtration rate using 18F-fluoride PET/CT,"Hyo Sang Lee, Yeon-Koo Kang, Hyunjong Lee, Jeong Hee Han, Byung Seok Moon, Seok-Soo Byun, Dong-Wan Chae, Keon Wook Kang, Won Woo Lee","Accurate measurement of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is essential for optimal decision making in many clinical settings of renal failure. We aimed to show that GFR can be accurately measured using compartmental tracer kinetic analysis of18F-fluoride dynamic PET/CT. Twenty-three male Sprague-Dawley rats of three experimental groups (cyclosporine-administered [n = 8], unilaterally nephrectomized [n = 8], and control [n = 7]) underwent simultaneous18F-fluoride dynamic PET/CT and reference51Cr-EDTA GFR (GFRCrEDTA) test at day 0 and post-intervention day 3.18F-fluoride PET GFR (GFRF-PET) was calculated by multiplying the influx rate and functional kidney volume in a single-tissue-compartmental kinetic model. Within-test repeatability and between-test agreement were evaluated by intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Bland-Altman analysis. In the control group, repeatability of GFRF-PETwas excellent (ICC = 0.9901, repeatability coefficient = 12.5%). GFRF-PETsignificantly decreased in the renally impaired rats in accordance with respective GFRCrEDTAchanges. In the pooled population, GFRF-PETagreed well with GFRCrEDTAwith minimal bias (-2.4%) and narrow 95% limits of agreement (-25.0% to 20.1%). These data suggest that the single-compartmental kinetic analysis of18F-fluoride dynamic PET/CT is an accurate method for GFR measurement.

Evaluation of 11C-LSN3172176 as a Novel PET Tracer for Imaging M1 Muscarinic Acetylcholine Receptors in Nonhuman Primates,"Nabeel B Nabulsi, Daniel Holden, Ming-Qiang Zheng, Frederic Bois, Shu-Fei Lin, Soheila Najafzadeh, Hong Gao, Jim Ropchan, Teresa Lara-Jaime, David Labaree, Anupama Shirali, Lawrence Slieker, Cynthia Jesudason, Vanessa Barth, Antonio Navarro, Nancy Kant, Richard E Carson, Yiyun Huang","The M1muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) plays an important role in learning and memory, and therefore is a target for development of drugs for treatment of cognitive impairments in Alzheimer disease and schizophrenia. The availability of M1-selective radiotracers for PET will help in developing therapeutic agents by providing an imaging tool for assessment of drug dose-receptor occupancy relationship. Here we report the synthesis and evaluation of11C-LSN3172176 (ethyl 4-(6-(methyl-11C)-2-oxoindolin-1-yl)-[1,4'-bipiperidine]-1'-carboxylate) in nonhuman primates.Methods:11C-LSN3172176 was radiolabeled via the Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling method. PET scans in rhesus macaques were acquired for 2 h with arterial blood sampling and metabolite analysis to measure the input function. Blocking scans with scopolamine (50 μg/kg) and the M1-selective agent AZD6088 (0.67 and 2 mg/kg) were obtained to assess tracer binding specificity and selectivity. Regional brain time-activity curves were analyzed with the 1-tissue-compartment model and the multilinear analysis method (MA1) to calculate regional distribution volume. Nondisplaceable binding potential values were calculated using the cerebellum as a reference region.Results:11C-LSN3172176 was synthesized with greater than 99% radiochemical purity and high molar activity. In rhesus monkeys,11C-LSN3172176 metabolized rapidly (29% ± 6% parent remaining at 15 min) and displayed fast kinetics and extremely high uptake in the brain. Imaging data were modeled well with the 1-tissue-compartment model and MA1 methods. MA1-derived distribution volume values were high (range, 10-81 mL/cm3) in all known M1mAChR-rich brain regions. Pretreatment with scopolamine and AZD6088 significantly reduced the brain uptake of11C-LSN3172176, thus demonstrating its binding specificity and selectivity in vivo. The cerebellum appeared to be a suitable reference region for derivation of nondisplaceable binding potential, which ranged from 2.42 in the globus pallidus to 8.48 in the nucleus accumbens.Conclusion:11C-LSN3172176 exhibits excellent in vivo binding and imaging characteristics in nonhuman primates and appears to be the first appropriate radiotracer for PET imaging of human M1AChR.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30733324/
Tryptophan metabolism in breast cancers: molecular imaging and immunohistochemistry studies,"Csaba Juhász, Zeina Nahleh, Ian Zitron, Diane C Chugani, Majid Z Janabi, Sudeshna Bandyopadhyay, Rouba Ali-Fehmi, Thomas J Mangner, Pulak K Chakraborty, Sandeep Mittal, Otto Muzik","Introduction: Tryptophan oxidation via the kynurenine pathway is an important mechanism of tumoral immunoresistance. Increased tryptophan metabolism via the serotonin pathway has been linked to malignant progression in breast cancer. In this study, we combined quantitative positron emission tomography (PET) with tumor immunohistochemistry to analyze tryptophan transport and metabolism in breast cancer.

Methods: Dynamic α-[(11)C]methyl-l-tryptophan (AMT) PET was performed in nine women with stage II-IV breast cancer. PET tracer kinetic modeling was performed in all tumors. Expression of L-type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1), indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO; the initial and rate-limiting enzyme of the kynurenine pathway) and tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (TPH1; the initial enzyme of the serotonin pathway) was assessed by immunostaining of resected tumor specimens.

Results: Tumor AMT uptake peaked at 5-20 min postinjection in seven tumors; the other two cases showed protracted tracer accumulation. Tumor standardized uptake values (SUVs) varied widely (2.6-9.8) and showed a strong positive correlation with volume of distribution values derived from kinetic analysis (P<.01). Invasive ductal carcinomas (n=6) showed particularly high AMT SUVs (range, 4.7-9.8). Moderate to strong immunostaining for LAT1, IDO and TPH1 was detected in most tumor cells.

Conclusions: Breast cancers show differential tryptophan kinetics on dynamic PET. SUVs measured 5-20 min postinjection reflect reasonably the tracer's volume of distribution. Further studies are warranted to determine if in vivo AMT accumulation in these tumors is related to tryptophan metabolism via the kynurenine and serotonin pathways.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22444239/
Pharmacokinetic Analysis of (64)Cu-ATSM Dynamic PET in Human Xenograft Tumors in Mice,"Fan Li, Jesper Tranekjær Jørgensen, Jacob Madsen, Andreas Kjaer","The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility to perform voxel-wise kinetic modeling on datasets obtained from tumor-bearing mice that underwent dynamic PET scans with (64)Cu-ATSM and extract useful physiological parameters.

Methods: Tumor-bearing mice underwent 90-min dynamic PET scans with (64)Cu-ATSM and CT scans with contrast. Irreversible and reversible two-tissue compartment models were fitted to time activity curves (TACs) obtained from whole tumor volumes and compared using the Akaike information criterion (AIC). Based on voxel-wise pharmacokinetic analysis, parametric maps of model rate constants k₁, k₃ and Ki were generated and compared to (64)Cu-ATSM uptake.

Results: Based on the AIC, an irreversible two-tissue compartment model was selected for voxel-wise pharmacokinetic analysis. Of the extracted parameters, k₁ (~perfusion) showed a strong correlation with early tracer uptake (mean spearman R = 0.88) 5 min post injection (pi). Moreover, positive relationships were found between late tracer uptake (90 min pi) and both k₃ and the net influx rate constant, Ki (mean spearman R = 0.56 and R = 0.86; respectively).

Conclusion: This study shows the feasibility to extract relevant parameters from voxel-wise pharmacokinetic analysis to be used for preclinical validation of (64)Cu-ATSM as a hypoxia-specific PET tracer.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26854145/
Sparse dose painting based on a dual-pass kinetic-oxygen mapping of dynamic PET images,"Kuangyu Shi, Sabrina T Astner, Liang Sun, Nassir Navab, Fridtjof Nüsslin, Peter Vaupel, Jan J Wilkens","Development of molecular imaging such as positron-emission tomography (PET) offers an opportunity to optimize radiotherapy treatment planning by conforming the dose distribution to physiological details within tumors, so called dose painting. Quantification of the acquired images and an efficient and practical dose prescription remain two key questions in this field. This paper proposes a novel framework to optimize the dose prescription based on dual-pass modeling of dynamic [18F]FMISO PET images. An optimization algorithm for sparse dose painting (SDP) is developed by minimizing a linear combination of two terms corresponding to the efficiency and total variation of the dose distribution with the constraint of a constant mean dose. Dose efficiency is defined using the linear-quadratic model. The radiosensitivity given by the oxygen tension is estimated using a dual-pass kinetic-oxygen mapping strategy. This is achieved by integrating a realistic [18F]FMISO PET imaging simulation model, which can simulate the distribution of oxygen and tracer under the same tumor microenvironment setting. The algorithm was compared with a typical dose painting by number (DPBN) method in one data set of a patient with head and neck cancer.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22003653/
In vivo Characterization of Four 18F-Labeled S1PR1 Tracers for Neuroinflammation,"Hui Liu, Zonghua Luo, Jiwei Gu, Hao Jiang, Sumit Joshi, Kooresh I Shoghi, Yun Zhou, Robert J Gropler, Tammie L S Benzinger, Zhude Tu","Purpose: The sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1PR1) is an important biomarker for imaging inflammation in the central nervous system (CNS). Herein, we report our recent evaluation of four18F-labeled S1PR1 tracers (18F-TZ43113,18F-TZ35104,18F-TZ4877, and18F-TZ4881) in a rat model of multiple sclerosis (MS).

Procedures: MicroPET studies of each tracer's uptake and kinetics were performed in an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) rat model of MS to quantify upregulated S1PR1 expression in the lumbar spinal cord of EAE rats. Western blot analysis was conducted to confirm the differences in the expression of S1PR1 protein level between EAE and sham rats. Radiometabolite analysis was performed for the most promising candidate in rats.

Results: All four S1PR1 tracers detected increased S1PR1 levels in response to neuroinflammation in the lumbar spinal cord of EAE rats, which was supported by western blot results. The ranked order of tracer uptake in rat spinal cord was18F-TZ4877 >18F-TZ4881 >18F-TZ35104 >18F-TZ43113.18F-TZ4877 had the highest uptake of the four tracers and showed good kinetic modeling fits in rat spinal cord using an image-based method of arterial blood input function. Radiometabolite analysis of18F-TZ4877 showed good in vivo stability with no major radiometabolite accumulation in the rat brain.

Conclusion: Among these four new PET tracers,18F-TZ4877 showed the most favorable profile for assessing S1PR1 expression in the EAE rat model of MS. Further characterization of these radiotracers in other models of neuroinflammation is warranted to identify a promising18F-labeled tracer for imaging S1PR1 in vivo.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32602083/
A new double modeling approach for dynamic cardiac PET studies using noise and spillover contaminated LV measurements,"D Feng, X Li, S C Huang","A new double modeling approach for dynamic cardiac studies with positron emission tomography (PET) to estimate physiological parameters is proposed. This approach is exemplified by tracer fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) studies and estimation of myocardial metabolic rate of glucose (MMRGlc). A separate input function model characterising the tracer kinetics in plasma is used to account for the measurement noise and spillover problems of the input curve obtained from the left ventricular region on the PET images. Measured left ventricle (LV) plasma time-activity and tissue time-activity curves are fitted simultaneously with cross contaminations by this input function model and the FDG model. The results indicate that the MMRGlc can be estimated much more accurately and reliably by this new approach. Compared with the traditional method, an improvement of about 20% in the estimated MMRGlc was achieved when the bidirectional spillover fractions are 20% at different noise levels studied. This new double modeling approach using two models fitting both the input and the output functions simultaneously is expected to be generally applicable to a broad range of system modeling.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8682545/

The PET studies were performed on three groups of subjects: (1) 12 normal volunteer subjects, aged 20 to 45 years, who received a single intravenous injection of 16 to 32 mCi of [11C]PMP; (2) six subjects, aged 21 to 44 years, who received two 16-mCi injections of [11C]PMP (baseline and visual stimulation, respectively); and (3) five subjects, aged 24 to 40 years, who received two 16-mCi injections separated by 200 minutes (baseline and after a 1-hour constant infusion of 1.5 mg of physostigmine, respectively). Dynamic acquisition consisted of a 17-frame sequence over 80 minutes. All analysis methods were based on a first-order kinetic model consisting of two tissue compartments with the parameter k3, representing PMP hydrolysis, being the index of AChE activity. Four different schemes were used to estimate k3: (1) an unconstrained non-linear least-squares fit estimating blood-brain barrier transport parameters, K1 and k2, in addition to the hydrolysis rate constant k3; (2) and (3), two methods of constraining the fit by fixing the volume of distribution of free tracer (DVfree); and (4), a direct estimation of k3 without use of an arterial input function based on the shape of the tissue time-activity curve alone. Results showed that k3 values from the unconstrained fitting and no input methods were estimated with similar accuracy, whereas the two methods using DVfree constraints yielded similar results. The authors conclude that the optimal analysis method for [11C]PMP differs as a function of AChE activity. All four methods gave precise measures of k3 in regions with low AChE activity (approximately 10% coefficient of variation in cortex), but surprisingly, with unconstrained methods yielding estimates with lower variability than constrained methods. In regions with moderate to high AChE activity, constrained methods were required to yield meaningful estimates and were superior to the unconstrained methods.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10532640/
¹⁸F-FLT and ¹⁸F-FDOPA PET kinetics in recurrent brain tumors,"Mirwais Wardak, Christiaan Schiepers, Timothy F Cloughesy, Magnus Dahlbom, Michael E Phelps, Sung-Cheng Huang","Purpose: In this study, kinetic parameters of the cellular proliferation tracer (18)F-3'-deoxy-3'-fluoro-L-thymidine (FLT) and the amino acid probe 3,4-dihydroxy-6-(18)F-fluoro-L-phenylalanine (FDOPA) were measured before and early after the start of therapy, and were used to predict the overall survival (OS) of patients with recurrent malignant glioma using multiple linear regression (MLR) analysis.

Methods: High-grade recurrent brain tumors in 21 patients (11 men and 10 women, age range 26 - 76 years) were investigated. Each patient had three dynamic PET studies with each probe: at baseline and after 2 and 6 weeks from the start of treatment. Treatment consisted of biweekly cycles of bevacizumab (an angiogenesis inhibitor) and irinotecan (a chemotherapeutic agent). For each study, about 3.5 mCi of FLT (or FDOPA) was administered intravenously and dynamic PET images were acquired for 1 h (or 35 min for FDOPA). A total of 126 PET scans were analyzed. A three-compartment, two-tissue model was applied to estimate tumor FLT and FDOPA kinetic rate constants using a metabolite- and partial volume-corrected input function. MLR analysis was used to model OS as a function of FLT and FDOPA kinetic parameters for each of the three studies as well as their relative changes between studies. An exhaustive search of MLR models using three or fewer predictor variables was performed to find the best models.

Results: Kinetic parameters from FLT were more predictive of OS than those from FDOPA. The three-predictor MLR model derived using information from both probes (adjusted R(2) = 0.83) fitted the OS data better than that derived using information from FDOPA alone (adjusted R(2) = 0.41), but was only marginally different from that derived using information from FLT alone (adjusted R(2) = 0.82). Standardized uptake values (either from FLT alone, FDOPA alone, or both together) gave inferior predictive results (best adjusted R(2) = 0.25).

Conclusion: For recurrent malignant glioma treated with bevacizumab and irinotecan, FLT kinetic parameters obtained early after the start of treatment (absolute values and their associated changes) can provide sufficient information to predict OS with reasonable confidence using MLR. The slight increase in accuracy for predicting OS with a combination of FLT and FDOPA PET information may not warrant the additional acquisition of FDOPA PET for therapy monitoring in patients with recurrent glioma.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24604590/
Models and methods for derivation of in vivo neuroreceptor parameters with PET and SPECT reversible radiotracers,"M Slifstein, M Laruelle","The science of quantitative analysis of PET and SPECT neuroreceptor imaging studies has grown considerably over the past decade. A number of methods have been proposed in which receptor parameter estimation results from fitting data to a model of the underlying kinetics of ligand uptake in the brain. These approaches have come to be collectively known as model-based methods and several have received widespread use. Here, we briefly review the most frequently used methods and examine their strengths and weaknesses. Kinetic modeling is the most direct implementation of the compartment models, but with some tracers accurate input function measurement and good compartment configuration identification can be difficult to obtain. Other methods were designed to overcome some particular vulnerability to error of classical kinetic modeling, but introduced new vulnerabilities in the process. Reference region methods obviate the need for arterial plasma measurement, but are not as robust to violations of the underlying modeling assumptions as methods using the arterial input function. Graphical methods give estimates of V(T) without the requirement of compartment model specification, but provide a biased estimator in the presence of statistical noise. True equilibrium methods are quite robust, but their use is limited to experiments with tracers that are suitable for constant infusion. In conclusion, there is no universally ""best"" method that is applicable to all neuroreceptor imaging studies, and carefully evaluation of model-based methods is required for each radiotracer.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11516703/
Kinetics and 28-day test-retest repeatability and reproducibility of [11C]UCB-J PET brain imaging,"Hayel Tuncel, Ronald Boellaard, Emma M Coomans, Erik Fj de Vries, Andor Wjm Glaudemans, Paula Kopschina Feltes, David V García, Sander Cj Verfaillie, Emma E Wolters, Steven P Sweeney, J Michael Ryan, Magnus Ivarsson, Berkley A Lynch, Patrick Schober, Philip Scheltens, Robert C Schuit, Albert D Windhorst, Peter P De Deyn, Bart Nm van Berckel, Sandeep Sv Golla","[11C]UCB-J is a novel radioligand that binds to synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A). The main objective of this study was to determine the 28-day test-retest repeatability (TRT) of quantitative [11C]UCB-J brain positron emission tomography (PET) imaging in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and healthy controls (HCs). Nine HCs and eight AD patients underwent two 60 min dynamic [11C]UCB-J PET scans with arterial sampling with an interval of 28 days. The optimal tracer kinetic model was assessed using the Akaike criteria (AIC). Micro-/macro-parameters such as tracer delivery (K1) and volume of distribution (VT) were estimated using the optimal model. Data were also analysed for simplified reference tissue model (SRTM) with centrum semi-ovale (white matter) as reference region. Based on AIC, both 1T2k_VBand 2T4k_VBdescribed the [11C]UCB-J kinetics equally well. Analysis showed that whole-brain grey matter TRT for VT, DVR and SRTM BPNDwere -2.2% ± 8.5, 0.4% ± 12.0 and -8.0% ± 10.2, averaged over all subjects. [11C]UCB-J kinetics can be well described by a 1T2k_VBmodel, and a 60 min scan duration was sufficient to obtain reliable estimates for both plasma input and reference tissue models. TRT for VT, DVR and BPNDwas <15% (1SD) averaged over all subjects and indicates adequate quantitative repeatability of [11C]UCB-J PET.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34013797/
Quantification of aromatase binding in the female human brain using [11 C]cetrozole positron emission tomography,"My Jonasson, Patrik Nordeman, Jonas Eriksson, Helena Wilking, Johan Wikström, Kayo Takahashi, Takashi Niwa, Takamitsu Hosoya, Yasuyoshi Watanabe, Gunnar Antoni, Inger Sundström Poromaa, Mark Lubberink, Erika Comasco","Aromatase, the enzyme that in the brain converts testosterone and androstenedione to estradiol and estrone, respectively, is a putative key factor in psychoneuroendocrinology. In vivo assessment of aromatase was performed to evaluate tracer kinetic models and optimal scan duration, for quantitative analysis of the aromatase positron emission tomography (PET) ligand [11C]cetrozole. Anatomical magnetic resonance and 90-min dynamic [11C]cetrozole PET-CT scans were performed on healthy women. Volume of interest (VOI)-based analyses with a plasma-input function were performed using the single-tissue and two-tissue (2TCM) reversible compartment models and plasma-input Logan analysis. Additionally, the simplified reference tissue model (SRTM), Logan reference tissue model (LRTM), and standardized uptake volume ratio model, with cerebellum as reference region, were evaluated. Parametric images were generated and regionally averaged voxel values were compared with VOI-based analyses of the reference tissue models. The optimal reference model was used for evaluation of a decreased scan duration. Differences between the plasma-input- and reference tissue-based methods and comparisons between scan durations were assessed by linear regression. The [11C]cetrozole time-activity curves were best described by the 2TCM. SRTM nondisplaceable binding potential (BPND), with cerebellum as reference region, can be used to estimate [11C]cetrozole binding and generated robust and quantitatively accurate results for a reduced scan duration of 60 min. Receptor parametric mapping, a basis function implementation of SRTM, as well as LRTM, produced quantitatively accurate parametric images, showing BPNDat the voxel level. As PET tracer, [11C]cetrozole can be employed for relatively short brain scans to measure aromatase binding using a reference tissue-based approach.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32761874/
Evaluation of [11C]UCB-A positron emission tomography in human brains,"Mengfei Xiong, Mark Lubberink, Lieuwe Appel, Xiaotian Tsong Fang, Torsten Danfors, Eva Kumlien, Gunnar Antoni","Background: In preclinical studies, the positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with [11C]UCB-A provided promising results for imaging synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A) as a proxy for synaptic density. This paper reports the first-in-human [11C]UCB-A PET study to characterise its kinetics in healthy subjects and further evaluate SV2A-specific binding.

Results: Twelve healthy subjects underwent 90-min baseline [11C]UCB-A scans with PET/MRI, with two subjects participating in an additional blocking scan with the same scanning procedure after a single dose of levetiracetam (1500 mg). Our results indicated abundant [11C]UCB-A brain uptake across all cortical regions, with slow elimination. Kinetic modelling of [11C]UCB-A PET using various compartment models suggested that the irreversible two-tissue compartment model best describes the kinetics of the radioactive tracer. Accordingly, the Patlak graphical analysis was used to simplify the analysis. The estimated SV2A occupancy determined by the Lassen plot was around 66%. Significant specific binding at baseline and comparable binding reduction as grey matter precludes the use of centrum semiovale as reference tissue.

Conclusions: [11C]UCB-A PET imaging enables quantifying SV2A in vivo. However, its slow kinetics require a long scan duration, which is impractical with the short half-life of carbon-11. Consequently, the slow kinetics and complicated quantification methods may restrict its use in humans.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38884834/
Head-to-Head Comparison of 11C-PBR28 and 18F-GE180 for Quantification of the Translocator Protein in the Human Brain,"Paolo Zanotti-Fregonara, Belen Pascual, Gaia Rizzo, Meixiang Yu, Neha Pal, David Beers, Randall Carter, Stanley H Appel, Nazem Atassi, Joseph C Masdeu","18F-GE180 is a third-generation PET tracer for quantifying the translocator protein (TSPO), a biomarker for inflammation. The aim of this study was to perform a head-to-head comparison of18F-GE180 and the well-established TSPO tracer11C-PBR28 by scanning with both tracers during the same day in the same subjects.Methods:Five subjects underwent a 90-min PET scan with11C-PBR28 in the morning and18F-GE180 in the afternoon. A metabolite-corrected arterial input function was obtained in each subject for both tracers, and the brain uptake was quantified with a 2-tissue-compartment model.Results:The rate of metabolism of18F-GE180 in arterial blood was slower than that of11C-PBR28 (the percentages of nonmetabolized parent in plasma at 90 min were 74.9% ± 4.15% [mean ± SD] and 11.2% ± 1.90%, respectively). The plasma free fractions were similar for both tracers: 3.5% ± 1.1% for18F-GE180 and 4.1% ± 1.1% for11C-PBR28. The average total volume of distribution (VT) of18F-GE180 was about 20 times smaller than that of11C-PBR28 (0.15 ± 0.03 mL/cm3for18F-GE180 and 3.27 ± 0.66 mL/cm3for11C-PBR28).18F-GE180 was characterized by poor transfer from the vascular compartment to the brain (its plasma-to-tissue rate constant [K1] was about 10 times smaller than that of11C-PBR28). Moreover, kinetic modeling was more difficult with18F-GE180, as itsVTvalues were identified with a lower precision than those of11C-PBR28 and outlying values were more frequent.Conclusion:TheVTof18F-GE180 was about 20 times smaller than that of11C-PBR28 because of low penetration into the brain from the vascular compartment. In addition, kinetic modeling of18F-GE180 was more challenging than that of11C-PBR28. Therefore, compared with11C-PBR28,18F-GE180 had unfavorable characteristics for TSPO imaging of the brain.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29348317/
"Evaluation of the agonist PET radioligand [¹¹C]GR103545 to image kappa opioid receptor in humans: kinetic model selection, test-retest reproducibility and receptor occupancy by the antagonist PF-04455242","Mika Naganawa, Leslie K Jacobsen, Ming-Qiang Zheng, Shu-Fei Lin, Anindita Banerjee, Wonkyung Byon, David Weinzimmer, Giampaolo Tomasi, Nabeel Nabulsi, Sarah Grimwood, Lori L Badura, Richard E Carson, Timothy J McCarthy, Yiyun Huang","Introduction: Kappa opioid receptors (KOR) are implicated in several brain disorders. In this report, a first-in-human positron emission tomography (PET) study was conducted with the potent and selective KOR agonist tracer, [(11)C]GR103545, to determine an appropriate kinetic model for analysis of PET imaging data and assess the test-retest reproducibility of model-derived binding parameters. The non-displaceable distribution volume (V(ND)) was estimated from a blocking study with naltrexone. In addition, KOR occupancy of PF-04455242, a selective KOR antagonist that is active in preclinical models of depression, was also investigated.

Methods: For determination of a kinetic model and evaluation of test-retest reproducibility, 11 subjects were scanned twice with [(11)C]GR103545. Seven subjects were scanned before and 75 min after oral administration of naltrexone (150 mg). For the KOR occupancy study, six subjects were scanned at baseline and 1.5 h and 8 h after an oral dose of PF-04455242 (15 mg, n=1 and 30 mg, n=5). Metabolite-corrected arterial input functions were measured and all scans were 150 min in duration. Regional time-activity curves (TACs) were analyzed with 1- and 2-tissue compartment models (1TC and 2TC) and the multilinear analysis (MA1) method to derive regional volume of distribution (V(T)). Relative test-retest variability (TRV), absolute test-retest variability (aTRV) and intra-class coefficient (ICC) were calculated to assess test-retest reproducibility of regional VT. Occupancy plots were computed for blocking studies to estimate occupancy and V(ND). The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of PF-04455242 was determined from occupancies and drug concentrations in plasma. [(11)C]GR103545 in vivo K(D) was also estimated.

Results: Regional TACs were well described by the 2TC model and MA1. However, 2TC VT was sometimes estimated with high standard error. Thus MA1 was the model of choice. Test-retest variability was ~15%, depending on the outcome measure. The blocking studies with naltrexone and PF-04455242 showed that V(T) was reduced in all regions; thus no suitable reference region is available for the radiotracer. V(ND) was estimated reliably from the occupancy plot of naltrexone blocking (V(ND)=3.4±0.9 mL/cm(3)). The IC50 of PF-04455242 was calculated as 55 ng/mL. [(11)C]GR103545 in vivo K(D) value was estimated as 0.069 nmol/L.

Conclusions: [(11)C]GR103545 PET can be used to image and quantify KOR in humans, although it has slow kinetics and variability of model-derived kinetic parameters is higher than desirable. This tracer should be suitable for use in receptor occupancy studies, particularly those that target high occupancy.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24844744/
Quantification of 18F-fluorocholine kinetics in patients with prostate cancer,"Eline E Verwer, Daniela E Oprea-Lager, Alfons J M van den Eertwegh, Reindert J A van Moorselaar, Albert D Windhorst, Lothar A Schwarte, N Harry Hendrikse, Robert C Schuit, Otto S Hoekstra, Adriaan A Lammertsma, Ronald Boellaard","Choline kinase is upregulated in prostate cancer, resulting in increased (18)F-fluoromethylcholine uptake. This study used pharmacokinetic modeling to validate the use of simplified methods for quantification of (18)F-fluoromethylcholine uptake in a routine clinical setting.

Methods: Forty-minute dynamic PET/CT scans were acquired after injection of 204 ± 9 MBq of (18)F-fluoromethylcholine, from 8 patients with histologically proven metastasized prostate cancer. Plasma input functions were obtained using continuous arterial blood-sampling as well as using image-derived methods. Manual arterial blood samples were used for calibration and correction for plasma-to-blood ratio and metabolites. Time-activity curves were derived from volumes of interest in all visually detectable lymph node metastases. (18)F-fluoromethylcholine kinetics were studied by nonlinear regression fitting of several single- and 2-tissue plasma input models to the time-activity curves. Model selection was based on the Akaike information criterion and measures of robustness. In addition, the performance of several simplified methods, such as standardized uptake value (SUV), was assessed.

Results: Best fits were obtained using an irreversible compartment model with blood volume parameter. Parent fractions were 0.12 ± 0.4 after 20 min, necessitating individual metabolite corrections. Correspondence between venous and arterial parent fractions was low as determined by the intraclass correlation coefficient (0.61). Results for image-derived input functions that were obtained from volumes of interest in blood-pool structures distant from tissues of high (18)F-fluoromethylcholine uptake yielded good correlation to those for the blood-sampling input functions (R(2) = 0.83). SUV showed poor correlation to parameters derived from full quantitative kinetic analysis (R(2) < 0.34). In contrast, lesion activity concentration normalized to the integral of the blood activity concentration over time (SUVAUC) showed good correlation (R(2) = 0.92 for metabolite-corrected plasma; 0.65 for whole-blood activity concentrations).

Conclusion: SUV cannot be used to quantify (18)F-fluoromethylcholine uptake. A clinical compromise could be SUVAUC derived from 2 consecutive static PET scans, one centered on a large blood-pool structure during 0-30 min after injection to obtain the blood activity concentrations and the other a whole-body scan at 30 min after injection to obtain lymph node activity concentrations.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25678491/

The objectives of the study were to determine the appropriate kinetic model to quantify binding of the tracer to M1 receptors, and the reliability of the chosen quantification method.Methods:Six healthy subjects completed the test-retest protocol, and 5 healthy subjects completed the baseline-scopolamine blocking protocol. Multiple modeling methods were applied to calculate total distribution volume (VT) and nondisplaceable binding potential (BPND) in various brain regions. The reference region was selected from the blocking study. The occupancy plot was applied to compute receptor occupancy by scopolamine and nondisplaceable distribution volume.Results:Tracer uptake was highest in the striatum, followed by neocortical regions and white matter, and lowest in the cerebellum. Regional time-activity curves were fitted well by all models. The 2-tissue-compartment (2TC) model fits were good, but the 2TC parameters often could not be reliably estimated. BecauseVTcorrelated well between the 2TC and 1-tissue-compartment (1TC) models after exclusion of unreliable estimates, the 1TC model was chosen as the most appropriate. The cerebellum showed the lowestVT, consistent with preclinical studies showing little to no specific binding in the region. Further, cerebellarVTdid not change between baseline and blocking scans, indicating that the cerebellum is a suitable reference region. The simplified reference tissue model (SRTM) slightly underestimated 1TCBPND, and the simplified reference tissue model 2 (SRTM2) improvedBPNDestimation. An 80-min scan was sufficient to quantifyVTandBPNDThe test-retest study showed excellent absolute test-retest variability for 1TCVT(≤5%) andBPND(≤10%). In the baseline and blocking studies, occupancy values were lower in the striatum than in nonstriatal regions, as may be attributed to differences in regional acetylcholine concentrations.Conclusion:The 1TC and SRTM2 models are appropriate for quantitative analysis of11C-LSN3172176 imaging data.11C-LSN3172176 displayed excellent test-retest reproducibility and is a highly promising ligand to quantify M1 receptors in the human brain.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32859711/

Similarly, such a tracer would be useful as a biomarker for enrollment of patients in clinical trials for evaluation of antiamyloid therapeutics. Furthermore, changes in the level of plaque burden as quantified by an amyloid plaque PET tracer may provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of amyloid-targeted therapeutics. This work describes our approach to evaluate and select a candidate PET tracer for in vivo quantification of human amyloid plaque.

Methods: Ligands were evaluated for their in vitro binding to human amyloid plaques, lipophilicity and predicted blood-brain barrier permeability. Candidates with favorable in vitro properties were radiolabeled with (18)F and evaluated in vivo. Baseline PET scans in rhesus monkey were conducted to evaluate the regional distribution and kinetics of each tracer using tracer kinetic modeling methods. High binding potential in cerebral white matter and cortical grey matter was considered an unfavorable feature of the candidate tracers.

Results: [(18)F]MK-3328 showed the most favorable combination of low in vivo binding potential in white matter and cortical grey matter in rhesus monkeys, low lipophilicity (Log D=2.91) and high affinity for human amyloid plaques (IC(50)=10.5±1.3 nM).

Inhibition of PDE10A has been identified as a potential target for treatment of various neuropsychiatric disorders. To assist drug development, we have identified a selective PDE10A positron emission tomography (PET) tracer, AMG 580. We describe here the radiosynthesis of [(18)F]AMG 580 and in vitro and in vivo characterization results.

Methods: The potency and selectivity were determined by in vitro assay using [(3)H]AMG 580 and baboon brain tissues. [(18)F]AMG 580 was prepared by a 1-step [(18)F]fluorination procedure. Dynamic brain PET scans were performed in non-human primates. Regions-of-interest were defined on individuals' MRIs and transferred to the co-registered PET images. Data were analyzed using two tissue compartment analysis (2TC), Logan graphical (Logan) analysis with metabolite-corrected input function and the simplified reference tissue model (SRTM) method. A PDE10A inhibitor and unlabeled AMG 580 were used to demonstrate the PDE10A specificity. KD was estimated by Scatchard analysis of high and low affinity PET scans.

Results: AMG 580 has an in vitro KD of 71.9 pM. Autoradiography showed specific uptake in striatum. Mean activity of 121 ± 18 MBq was used in PET studies. In Rhesus, the baseline BPND for putamen and caudate was 3.38 and 2.34, respectively, via 2TC, and 3.16, 2.34 via Logan, and 2.92, and 2.01 via SRTM. A dose dependent decrease of BPND was observed by the pre-treatment with a PDE10A inhibitor. In baboons, 0.24 mg/kg dose of AMG 580 resulted in about 70% decrease of BPND. The in vivo KD of [(18)F]AMG 580 was estimated to be around 0.44 nM in baboons.

Conclusion: [(18)F]AMG 580 is a selective and potent PDE10A PET tracer with excellent specific striatal binding in non-human primates. It warrants further evaluation in humans.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25935386/
Model-free quantification of dynamic PET data using nonparametric deconvolution,"Francesca Zanderigo, Ramin V Parsey, R Todd Ogden","Dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) data are usually quantified using compartment models (CMs) or derived graphical approaches. Often, however, CMs either do not properly describe the tracer kinetics, or are not identifiable, leading to nonphysiologic estimates of the tracer binding. The PET data are modeled as the convolution of the metabolite-corrected input function and the tracer impulse response function (IRF) in the tissue. Using nonparametric deconvolution methods, it is possible to obtain model-free estimates of the IRF, from which functionals related to tracer volume of distribution and binding may be computed, but this approach has rarely been applied in PET. Here, we apply nonparametric deconvolution using singular value decomposition to simulated and test-retest clinical PET data with four reversible tracers well characterized by CMs ([(11)C]CUMI-101, [(11)C]DASB, [(11)C]PE2I, and [(11)C]WAY-100635), and systematically compare reproducibility, reliability, and identifiability of various IRF-derived functionals with that of traditional CMs outcomes. Results show that nonparametric deconvolution, completely free of any model assumptions, allows for estimates of tracer volume of distribution and binding that are very close to the estimates obtained with CMs and, in some cases, show better test-retest performance than CMs outcomes.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25873427/
[¹¹C]acetate and PET/CT assessment of muscle activation in rat studies,"Sara Trombella, David García, Didier J Colin, Stéphane Germain, Yann Seimbille, Osman Ratib","Purpose: The purpose of the present study is to apply kinetic analysis to investigate exercise-related changes in the metabolism of the skeletal muscle of the rat hindlimb by [[Formula: see text]]acetate positron emission tomography and computed tomography (PET/CT).

Methods: Contractions were induced in Wistar rats' left hindlimb by electrostimulation of the Vastus Lateralis muscle motor point. After 15 min of muscle contractions, [[Formula: see text]]acetate was injected and PET/CT of both hindlimbs was acquired. The resting hindlimb was used as a control reference. The kinetic parameters [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] were calculated for the target muscles (exercised and control) and correlated with the corresponding standardized uptake values (SUVs). The ratio between each kinetic parameter values and the SUV extracted for the exercised muscle and the muscle at rest was computed ([Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text], respectively).

Results: Kinetic analysis quantitatively confirmed that net tracer uptake ([Formula: see text]) and washout ([Formula: see text]) were significantly higher in exercised muscles ([Formula: see text] for exercised muscles vs. [Formula: see text] for resting muscles, [Formula: see text]; [Formula: see text] for exercised muscle vs. [Formula: see text] for resting muscle, [Formula: see text]).

In this study, we tested the quantification reliability of the SV2A PET tracer, [18F]SynVesT-1, in a mouse model of AD (APP/PS1) and wild-type controls, and developed a simplified quantification method to facilitate large cohort preclinical imaging studies.

Procedures: We generated nondisplaceable binding potential (BPND) and distribution volume ratio (DVR) values using the simplified reference tissue model (SRTM) on the 90-min dynamic PET imaging data, with brain stem and cerebellum as the reference region, respectively. Then, we correlated the standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR)-1 and SUVR averaged from different imaging windows with BPNDand DVR, using brain stem and cerebellum as the reference region, respectively. We performed homologous competitive binding assay and autoradiographic saturation binding assay using [18F]SynVesT-1 to calculate the Bmaxand Kd.

Results: Using brain stem as the reference region, the averaged SUVR-1 from 30 to 60 min postinjection correlated well with the BPNDcalculated using SRTM. Using cerebellum as the reference region, the averaged SUVR from 30 to 60 min postinjection correlated well with the SRTM DVR. From the homologous competitive binding assay and autoradiographic saturation binding assay, the calculated the Bmaxand Kdwere 4.5-18 pmol/mg protein and 9.8-19.6 nM, respectively, for rodent brain tissue.

Conclusions: This simplified SUVR method provides reasonable SV2A measures in APP/PS1 mice and their littermate controls. Our data indicate that, in lieu of a full 90-min dynamic scan, a 30-min static PET scan (from 30 to 60 min postinjection) would be sufficient to provide quantification data on SV2A expression, equivalent to the data generated from kinetic modeling. The methods developed here are readily applicable to the evaluation of therapeutic effects of novel drugs in this rodent model using [18F]SynVesT-1 and small animal PET.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33258040/
Internal validation of myocardial flow reserve PET imaging using stress/rest myocardial activity ratios with Rb-82 and N-13-ammonia,"Daniel Juneau, Kai Yi Wu, Nicole Kaps, Jason Yao, Jennifer M Renaud, Rob S B Beanlands, Terrence D Ruddy, Robert A deKemp","Background: Myocardial flow reserve (MFR) measurement provides incremental diagnostic and prognostic information. The objective of the current study was to investigate the application of a simplified model for the estimation of MFR using only the stress/rest myocardial activity ratio (MAR) in patients undergoing rest-stress cardiac PET MPI.

Methods and results: Rest and dipyridamole stress dynamic PET imaging was performed in consecutive patients using82Rb or13NH3(n = 250 each). Reference standard MFR was quantified using a standard one-tissue compartment model. Stress/rest myocardial activity ratio (MAR) was calculated using the LV-mean activity from 2 to 6 minutes post-injection. Simplified estimates of MFR (MFREST) were then calculated using an inverse power function. For13NH3, there was good correlation between MFR and MFRESTvalues (R = 0.63), with similar results for82Rb (R = 0.73). There was no bias in the MFRESTvalues with either tracer. The overall diagnostic performance of MFRESTfor detection of MFR < 2 was good with ROC area under the curve (AUC) = 83.2 ± 1.2% for13NH3and AUC = 90.4 ± 0.7% for82Rb.

Conclusion: MFR was estimated with good accuracy using82Rb and13NH3with a simplified method that relies only on stress/rest activity ratios. This novel approach does not require dynamic imaging or tracer kinetic modeling. It may be useful for routine quality assurance of PET MFR measurements, or in scanners where full dynamic imaging and tracer kinetic modeling is not feasible for technical or logistical reasons.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33389638/
Single-voxel delay map from long-axial field-of-view PET scans,"Frederik Bay Nielsen, Ulrich Lindberg, Heloisa N Bordallo, Camilla Bardram Johnbeck, Ian Law, Barbara Malene Fischer, Flemming Littrup Andersen, Thomas Lund Andersen","Objective: We present an algorithm to estimate the delay between a tissue time-activity curve and a blood input curve at a single-voxel level tested on whole-body data from a long-axial field-of-view scanner with tracers of different noise characteristics.

Methods: Whole-body scans of 15 patients divided equally among three tracers, namely [15O]H2O, [18F]FDG and [64Cu]Cu-DOTATATE, which were used in development and testing of the algorithm. Delay times were estimated by fitting the cumulatively summed input function and tissue time-activity curve with special considerations for noise. To evaluate the performance of the algorithm, it was compared against two other algorithms also commonly applied in delay estimation: name cross-correlation and a one-tissue compartment model with incorporated delay. All algorithms were tested on both synthetic time-activity curves produced with the one-tissue compartment model with increasing levels of noise and delays between the tissue activity curve and the blood input curve. Whole-body delay maps were also calculated for each of the three tracers with data acquired on a long-axial field-of-view scanner with high time resolution.

Results: Our proposed model performs better for low signal-to-noise ratio time-activity curves compared to both cross-correlation and the one-tissue compartment models for non-[15O]H2O tracers. Testing on synthetically produced time-activity curves showed only a small and even residual delay, while the one-tissue compartment model with included delay showed varying residual delays.

Conclusion: The algorithm is robust to noise and proves applicable on a range of tracers as tested on [15O]H2O, [18F]FDG and [64Cu]Cu-DOTATATE, and hence is a viable option offering the ability for delay correction across various organs and tracers in use with kinetic modeling.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39355217/
Pharmacokinetic Modeling of (R)-[11C]verapamil to Measure the P-Glycoprotein Function in Nonhuman Primates,"Lara García-Varela, David Vállez García, Takeharu Kakiuchi, Hiroyuki Ohba, Shingo Nishiyama, Tetsuro Tago, Philip H Elsinga, Hideo Tsukada, Nicola A Colabufo, Rudi A J O Dierckx, Aren van Waarde, Jun Toyohara, Ronald Boellaard, Gert Luurtsema","(R)-[11C]verapamil is a radiotracer widely used for the evaluation of the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) function at the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Several studies have evaluated the pharmacokinetics of (R)-[11C]verapamil in rats and humans under different conditions. However, to the best of our knowledge, the pharmacokinetics of (R)-[11C]verapamil have not yet been evaluated in nonhuman primates. Our study aims to establish (R)-[11C]verapamil as a reference P-gp tracer for comparison of a newly developed P-gp positron emission tomography (PET) tracer in a species close to humans. Therefore, the study assesses the kinetics of (R)-[11C]verapamil and evaluates the effect of scan duration and P-gp inhibition on estimated pharmacokinetic parameters. Three nonhuman primates underwent two dynamic 91 min PET scans with arterial blood sampling, one at baseline and another after inhibition of the P-gp function. The (R)-[11C]verapamil data were analyzed using 1-tissue compartment model (1-TCM) and 2-tissue compartment model fits using plasma-corrected for polar radio-metabolites or non-corrected for radio-metabolites as an input function and with various scan durations (10, 20, 30, 60, and 91 min). The preferred model was chosen according to the Akaike information criterion and the standard errors (SE %) of the estimated parameters. 1-TCM was selected as the model of choice to analyze the (R)-[11C]verapamil data at baseline and after inhibition and for all scan durations tested. The volume of distribution (VT) and the efflux constantk2estimations were affected by the evaluated scan durations, whereas the influx constantK1estimations remained relatively constant. After P-gp inhibition (tariquidar, 8 mg/kg), in a 91 min scan duration, the whole-brainVTincreased significantly up to 208% (p< 0.001) andK1up to 159% (p< 0.001) compared with baseline scans. Thek2values decreased significantly after P-gp inhibition in all the scan durations except for the 91 min scans. This study suggests the use ofK1, calculated with 1-TCM and using short PET scans (10 to 30 min), as a suitable parameter to measure the P-gp function at the BBB of nonhuman primates.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33315404/
In Vivo Quantitative Whole-Body Perfusion Imaging Using Radiolabeled Copper(II) Bis(Thiosemicarbazone) Complexes and Positron Emission Tomography (PET),"Mark A Green, Carla J Mathias, Nathaniel J Smith, Monica Cheng, Gary D Hutchins","Traditional quantitative perfusion imaging methods require complex data acquisition and analysis strategies; typically require ancillary arterial blood sampling for measurement of input functions; are limited to single organ or tissue regions in an imaging session; and because of their complexity, are not well suited for routine clinical implementation in a standardized fashion that can be readily repeated across diverse clinical sites. The whole-body perfusion method described in this chapter has the advantages of on-demand radiotracer production; simple tissue pharmacokinetics enabling standardized estimation of perfusion; short-lived radionuclides, facilitating repeat or combination imaging procedures; and scalability to support widespread clinical implementation. This method leverages the unique physiological characteristics of radiolabeled copper(II) bis(thiosemicarbazone) complexes and the detection sensitivity of positron emission tomography (PET) to produce quantitatively accurate whole-body perfusion images. This chapter describes the synthesis of ethylglyoxal bis(thosemicarbazonato)copper(II) labeled with copper-62 ([62Cu]Cu-ETS), its unique physiological characteristics, a simple tracer kinetic model for estimation of perfusion using image-derived input functions, and validation of the method against a reference standard perfusion tracer.

N-[11C]Methyl-AMD3465 PET as a Tool for In Vivo Measurement of Chemokine Receptor 4 (CXCR4) Occupancy by Therapeutic Drugs,"S V Hartimath, M A Khayum, A van Waarde, R A J O Dierckx, E F J de Vries","Purpose: Chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) is overexpressed in many cancers and a potential drug target. We have recently developed the tracer N-[11C]methyl-AMD3465 for imaging of CXCR4 expression by positron emission tomography (PET). We investigated the pharmacokinetics of N-[11C]methyl-AMD3465 in rats bearing a C6 tumor and assessed whether the CXCR4 occupancy by the drug Plerixafor® can be measured with this PET tracer.

Procedure: A subcutaneous C6 tumor was grown in Wistar rats. Dynamic N-[11C]methyl-AMD3465 PET scans with arterial blood sampling was performed in control rats and rats pretreated with Plerixafor® (30 mg/kg, s.c). The distribution volume (VT) of the tracer was estimated by compartment modeling with a two-tissue reversible compartment model (2TRCM) and by Logan graphical analysis. The non-displaceable binding potential (BPND) was estimated with the 2TRCM. Next, CXCR4 receptor occupancy of different doses of the drug Plerixafor® (0.5-60 mg/kg) was investigated.

Results: The tumor could be clearly visualized by PET in control animals. Pretreatment with 30 mg/kg Plerixafor® significantly reduced tumor uptake (SUV 0.65 ± 0.08 vs. 0.20 ± 0.01, p < 0.05). N-[11C]Methyl-AMD3465 was slowly metabolized in vivo, with 70 ± 7% of the tracer in plasma still being intact after 60 min. The tracer showed reversible in vivo binding to its receptor. Both 2TRCM modeling and Logan graphical analysis could be used to estimate VT. Pre-treatment with 30 mg/kg Plerixafor® resulted in a significant reduction in VT(2TCRM 0.87 ± 0.10 vs. 0.23 ± 0.12, p < 0.05) and BPND(1.85 ± 0.14 vs. 0.87 ± 0.12, p < 0.01). Receptor occupancy by Plerixafor® was dose-dependent with an in vivo ED50of 12.7 ± 4.0 mg/kg. Logan analysis gave comparable results.

Conclusion: N-[11C]Methyl-AMD3465 PET can be used to visualize CXCR4 expression and to calculate receptor occupancy. VTdetermined by Logan graphical analysis is a suitable parameter to assess CXCR4 receptor occupancy. This approach can easily be translated to humans and used for early drug development and optimization of drug dosing schedules.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27896627/
Development of radioligands with optimized imaging properties for quantification of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors by positron emission tomography,"Andrew G Horti, Yongjun Gao, Hiroto Kuwabara, Robert F Dannals","Aims: There is an urgent need for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) to study the role of the nicotinic system in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, schizophrenia, drug dependence and many other disorders. Greater understanding of the underlying mechanisms of the nicotinic system could direct the development of medications to treat these disorders. Central nAChRs also contribute to a variety of brain functions, including cognition, behavior and memory.

Main methods: Currently, only two radiotracers, (S)-3-(azetidin-2-ylmethoxy)-2-[(18)F]fluoropyridine (2-[(18)F]FA) and (S)-5-(azetidin-2-ylmethoxy)-2-[(18)F]fluoropyridine (6-[(18)F]FA), are available for studying nAChRs in human brain using PET. However, the ""slow"" brain kinetics of these radiotracers hamper mathematical modeling and reliable measurement of kinetic parameters since it takes 4-7 h of PET scanning for the tracers to reach steady state. The imaging drawbacks of the presently available nAChR radioligands have initiated the development of radioligands with faster brain kinetics by several research groups.

Key findings: This minireview attempts to survey the important achievements of several research groups in the discovery of PET nicotinic radioligands reached recently. Specifically, this article reviews papers published from 2006 through 2008 describing the development of fifteen new nAChR (11)C-and (18)F-ligands that show improved imaging properties over 2-[(18)F]FA.

Significance: The continuous efforts of radiomedicinal chemists led to the development of several interesting PET radioligands for imaging of nAChR including [(18)F]AZAN, a potentially superior alternative to 2-[(18)F]FA.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19303028/
PET quantification of 18F-florbetaben binding to β-amyloid deposits in human brains,"Georg A Becker, Masanori Ichise, Henryk Barthel, Julia Luthardt, Marianne Patt, Anita Seese, Marcus Schultze-Mosgau, Beate Rohde, Hermann-Josef Gertz, Cornelia Reininger, Osama Sabri","(18)F-florbetaben is a novel (18)F-labeled tracer for PET imaging of β-amyloid deposits in the human brain. We evaluated the kinetic model-based approaches to the quantification of β-amyloid binding in the brain from dynamic PET data. The validity of the practically useful tissue ratio was also evaluated against the model-based parameters.

Methods: (18)F-florbetaben PET imaging was performed with concurrent multiple arterial sampling after tracer injection (300 MBq) in 10 Alzheimer disease (AD) patients and 10 age-matched healthy controls. Regional brain-tissue time-activity curves for 90 min were analyzed by a 1-tissue-compartment model and a 2-tissue-compartment model (2TCM) with metabolite-corrected plasma data estimating the specific distribution volume (VS) and distribution volume ratio (DVR [2TCM]) and a multilinear reference tissue model estimating DVR (DVR [MRTM]) using the cerebellar cortex as the reference tissue. Target-to-reference tissue standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs) at 70-90 min were also calculated.

Results: All brain regions required 2TCM to describe the time-activity curves. All β-amyloid binding parameters in the cerebral cortex (VS, DVR [2TCM], DVR [MRTM], and SUVR) were significantly increased in AD patients (P < 0.05), and there were significant linear correlations among these parameters (r(2) > 0.83). Effect sizes in group discrimination between 8 β-amyloid-positive AD scans and 9 β-amyloid-negative healthy control scans for all binding parameters were excellent, being largest for DVR (2TCM) (4.22) and smallest for VS (3.25) and intermediate and the same for DVR (MRTM) and SUVR (4.03).

Conclusion: These results suggest that compartment kinetic model-based quantification of β-amyloid binding from (18)F-florbetaben PET data is feasible and that all β-amyloid binding parameters including SUVR are excellent in discriminating between β-amyloid-positive and -negative scans.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23471310/
In vivo imaging of brain estrogen receptors in rats: a 16α-18F-fluoro-17β-estradiol PET study,"Mohammed A Khayum, Erik F J de Vries, Andor W J M Glaudemans, Rudi A J O Dierckx, Janine Doorduin","The steroid hormone estrogen is important for brain functioning and is thought to be involved in brain diseases, such as Alzheimer disease and depression. The action of estrogen is mediated by estrogen receptors (ERs). To understand the role of estrogens in brain functioning, it is important to study ERs in the brain. The aims of the present study were to determine whether ERs could be measured in the rat brain by PET with the ER ligand 16α-(18)F-fluoro-17β-estradiol ((18)F-FES) and to evaluate whether tracer uptake was affected by endogenous estrogen.

Methods: Small-animal PET was used to determine (18)F-FES uptake in female rats in the diestrous phase of the estrous cycle, the proestrous phase, and after ovariectomy. Coinjection of (18)F-FES with 17β-estradiol was performed to determine whether tracer binding was specific for ERs. Additionally, (18)F-FES uptake was quantified with kinetic modeling in female rats in the proestrous phase and after ovariectomy and in male rats.

Results: The highest levels of uptake of (18)F-FES were found (in descending order) in the pituitary, hypothalamus, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, and amygdala. Other brain regions showed low levels of brain uptake. The level of (18)F-FES uptake was higher in the pituitary and hypothalamus in rats after ovariectomy than in rats in the proestrous phase. Coinjection with 17β-estradiol resulted in a decrease in (18)F-FES uptake in the pituitary and hypothalamus. The volume of distribution and binding potential determined with kinetic modeling were higher in the pituitary than in the other brain regions in all 3 groups. No differences were found among the groups.

Conclusion: (18)F-FES PET imaging of ER availability in the rat brain is feasible for brain regions with high ER densities.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24481026/
Modeling of fluorine-18-6-fluoro-L-Dopa in humans,"L Wahl, C Nahmias","Fluorine-18-6-fluoro-L-Dopa (F-Dopa) has been used successfully to evaluate striatal dopaminergic function in humans. The kinetic analysis of F-Dopa studies, however, is confounded by the presence of [18F]6-fluoro-3-O-methyl-L-Dopa (OMFD), the major metabolite of F-Dopa formed in the periphery that crosses the blood-brain barrier. We present results of compartmental analysis in subjects in whom we independently measured the kinetics of OMFD in the blood and striatum, and used this knowledge to solve for the kinetics of F-Dopa.

Methods: The kinetics of F-Dopa in striatum were measured with PET from 0 to 150 min after an intravenous bolus injection of tracer in four normal subjects and two patients suffering from Parkinson's disease. On a separate occasion, the kinetics of OMFD were determined in the plasma and striatum of the same individuals. The measured OMFD kinetics of each individual allowed us to reduce the number of compartments and rate constants which have to be solved for any compartmental analysis of the kinetics of F-Dopa.

Results: A two-compartmental, three rate-constant model was sufficient to describe the time course of F-Dopa and its metabolites in the striatum. The rate constant (k21) representing the decarboxylation rate of F-Dopa was 0.0124 min-1 in the normal subjects, and 0.0043 min-1 in the parkinsonian patients.

Conclusion: The data do not support the need to include a fourth rate constant representing the egress of F-Dopamine and its metabolites. The forward transport rates for F-Dopa and OMFD from plasma to striatum are very similar in humans.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8772639/
Assessing skeletal muscle glucose metabolism with positron emission tomography,"D E Kelley, J C Price, C Cobelli","Insulin has a marked effect to stimulate the transport and metabolism of glucose in skeletal muscle in healthy individuals, whereas an impaired response, termed insulin resistance, is a major risk factor for diabetes mellitus and other metabolic diseases. Studies of the molecular physiology of insulin action in skeletal muscle indicate that a principal loci of control resides within the proximal steps of glucose transport and phosphorylation. Deoxyglucose, the metabolism of which is limited to these proximal steps, is widely used for in vitro studies of insulin action on glucose transport. The technologies of PET imaging provide a unique opportunity to carry out similar studies in vivo in human skeletal muscle. In this instance, a short-lived positron labeled tracer, [18F] FDG, can be given at sufficiently high specific activity to image not only glucose uptake, but by dynamic PET imaging, by monitoring the time course of [18F] FDG tissue activity, data can be generated to examine the kinetics of glucose transport and phosphorylation. The experimental procedures of this approach, including an overview of the mathematical modeling, are described in this review, along with some of the key findings of the initial applications of PET for the study of glucose metabolism in human skeletal muscle.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11895076/

A recently introduced kit formulation method, which uses an (18)F-fluoride-aluminum complex labeled RGD tracer ([(18)F]AlF-NOTA-PRGD2), provides a strategy for simplifying the labeling procedure to facilitate clinical translation. Meanwhile, an easy-to-prepare (68)Ga-labeled NOTA-PRGD2 has also been reported to have promising properties for imaging integrin α(v)β(3). The purpose of this study is to quantitatively compare the pharmacokinetic parameters of [(18)F]FPPRGD2, [(18)F]AlF-NOTA-PRGD2, and [(68)Ga]Ga-NOTA-PRGD2. U87MG tumor-bearing mice underwent 60-min dynamic PET scans following the injection of three tracers. Kinetic parameters were calculated using Logan graphical analysis with reference tissue. Parametric maps were generated using voxel-level modeling. All three compounds showed high binding potential (Bp(ND) = k(3)/k(4)) in tumor voxels. [(18)F]AlF-NOTA-PRGD2 showed comparable Bp(ND) value (3.75±0.65) with those of [(18)F]FPPRGD2 (3.39±0.84) and [(68)Ga]Ga-NOTA-PRGD2 (3.09±0.21) (p>0.05). Little difference was found in volume of distribution (V(T)) among these three RGD tracers in tumor, liver and muscle. Parametric maps showed similar kinetic parameters for all three tracers. We also demonstrated that the impact of non-specific binding could be eliminated in the kinetic analysis. Consequently, kinetic parameter estimation showed more comparable results among groups than static image analysis. In conclusion, [(18)F]AlF-NOTA-PRGD2 and [(68)Ga]Ga-NOTA-PRGD2 have comparable pharmacokinetics and quantitative parameters compared to those of [(18)F]FPPRGD2.

Improved modeling of in vivo kinetics of slowly diffusing radiotracers for tumor imaging,"Moses Q Wilks, Scott M Knowles, Anna M Wu, Sung-Cheng Huang","Large-molecule tracers, such as labeled antibodies, have shown success in immuno-PET for imaging of specific cell surface biomarkers. However, previous work has shown that localization of such tracers shows high levels of heterogeneity in target tissues, due to both the slow diffusion and the high affinity of these compounds. In this work, we investigate the effects of subvoxel spatial heterogeneity on measured time-activity curves in PET imaging and the effects of ignoring diffusion limitation on parameter estimates from kinetic modeling.

Methods: Partial differential equations (PDE) were built to model a radially symmetric reaction-diffusion equation describing the activity of immuno-PET tracers. The effects of slower diffusion on measured time-activity curves and parameter estimates were measured in silico, and a modified Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm with Bayesian priors was developed to accurately estimate parameters from diffusion-limited data. This algorithm was applied to immuno-PET data of mice implanted with prostate stem cell antigen-overexpressing tumors and injected with (124)I-labeled A11 anti-prostate stem cell antigen minibody.

Results: Slow diffusion of tracers in linear binding models resulted in heterogeneous localization in silico but no measurable differences in time-activity curves. For more realistic saturable binding models, measured time-activity curves were strongly dependent on diffusion rates of the tracers. Fitting diffusion-limited data with regular compartmental models led to parameter estimate bias in an excess of 1,000% of true values, while the new model and fitting protocol could accurately measure kinetics in silico. In vivo imaging data were also fit well by the new PDE model, with estimates of the dissociation constant (Kd) and receptor density close to in vitro measurements and with order of magnitude differences from a regular compartmental model ignoring tracer diffusion limitation.

Conclusion: Heterogeneous localization of large, high-affinity compounds can lead to large differences in measured time-activity curves in immuno-PET imaging, and ignoring diffusion limitations can lead to large errors in kinetic parameter estimates. Modeling of these systems with PDE models with Bayesian priors is necessary for quantitative in vivo measurements of kinetics of slow-diffusion tracers.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24994929/
A Variational Bayesian inference method for parametric imaging of PET data,"M Castellaro, G Rizzo, M Tonietto, M Veronese, F E Turkheimer, M A Chappell, A Bertoldo","In dynamic Positron Emission Tomography (PET) studies, compartmental models provide the richest information on the tracer kinetics of the tissue. Inverting such models at the voxel level is however quite challenging due to the low signal-to-noise ratio of the time activity curves. In this study, we propose the use of a Variational Bayesian (VB) approach to efficiently solve this issue and thus obtain robust quantitative parametric maps. VB was adapted to the non-uniform noise distribution of PET data. Moreover, we propose a novel hierarchical scheme to define the model parameter priors directly from the images in case such information are not available from the literature, as often happens with new PET tracers. VB was initially tested on synthetic data generated using compartmental models of increasing complexity, providing accurate (%bias<2%±2%, root mean square error<15%±5%) parameter estimates. When applied to real data on a paradigmatic set of PET tracers (L-[1-11C]leucine, [11C]WAY100635 and [18F]FDG), VB was able to generate reliable parametric maps even in presence of high noise in the data (unreliable estimates<11%±5%).",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28213113/
Spatio-temporal pharmacokinetic model based registration of 4D PET neuroimaging data,"Jieqing Jiao, Graham E Searle, Andri C Tziortzi, Cristian A Salinas, Roger N Gunn, Julia A Schnabel","In dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) neuroimaging studies, where scan durations often exceed 1h, registration of motion-corrupted dynamic PET images is necessary in order to maintain the integrity of the physiological, pharmacological, or biochemical information derived from the tracer kinetic analysis of the scan. In this work, we incorporate a pharmacokinetic model, which is traditionally used to analyse PET data following any registration, into the registration process itself in order to allow for a groupwise registration of the temporal time frames. The new method is shown to achieve smaller registration errors and improved kinetic parameter estimates on validation data sets when compared with image similarity based registration approaches. When applied to measured clinical data from 10 healthy subjects scanned with [(11)C]-(+)-PHNO (a dopamine D3/D2 receptor tracer), it reduces the intra-class variability on the receptor binding outcome measure, further supporting the improvements in registration accuracy. Our method incorporates a generic tracer kinetic model which makes it applicable to different PET radiotracers to remove motion artefacts and increase the integrity of dynamic PET studies.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23994455/
Dynamic FDG-PET/CT in the Initial Staging of Primary Breast Cancer: Clinicopathological Correlations,"Kornélia Kajáry, Zsolt Lengyel, Anna-Mária Tőkés, Janina Kulka, Magdolna Dank, Tímea Tőkés","Our aim was to evaluate correlation between clinicopathological features (clinical T and clinical N stages; histological type; nuclear grade; hormone-receptor and HER2 status, proliferation activity and tumor subtypes) of breast cancer and kinetic parameters measured by staging dynamic FDG-PET/CT examinations. Following ethical approval and patients' informed consent we included 34 patients with 35 primary breast cancers in our prospective study. We performed dynamic PET imaging, and assessed plasma activity noninvasively. To delineate primary tumors we applied a frame-by-frame semi-automatic software-based correction of motion artefacts. FDG two-compartment kinetic modelling was applied to assess K1, k2, k3 rate coefficients and to calculate Ki (tracer flux constant) and MRFDG (FDG metabolic rate). We found that k3, Ki and MRFDG were significantly higher in higher grade (p = 0.0246, 0.0089 and 0.0076, respectively), progesterone-receptor negative (p = 0.0344, 0.0217 and 0.0132) and highly-proliferating (p = 0.0414, 0.0193 and 0.0271) tumors as well as in triple-negative and hormone-receptor negative/HER2-positive subtypes (p = 0.0310, 0.0280 and 0.0186). Ki and MRFDG were significantly higher in estrogen-receptor negative tumors (p = 0.0300 and 0.0247, respectively). Ki was significantly higher in node-positive than in node-negative disease (p = 0.0315). None of the assessed FDG-kinetic parameters showed significant correlation with stromal TIL. In conclusion, we confirmed a significant relationship between kinetic parameters measured by dynamic PET and the routinely assessed clinicopathological factors of breast cancer: high-grade, hormone-receptor negative tumors with high proliferation rate are characterized by higher cellular FDG-uptake and FDG-phosphorylation rate. Furthermore, we found that kinetic parameters based on the dynamic examinations are probably not influenced by stromal TIL infiltration.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30941738/
"[18F]GTP1 (Genentech Tau Probe 1), a radioligand for detecting neurofibrillary tangle tau pathology in Alzheimer's disease","Sandra Sanabria Bohórquez, Jan Marik, Annie Ogasawara, Jeff N Tinianow, Herman S Gill, Olivier Barret, Gilles Tamagnan, David Alagille, Gai Ayalon, Paul Manser, Thomas Bengtsson, Michael Ward, Simon-Peter Williams, Geoffrey A Kerchner, John P Seibyl, Kenneth Marek, Robby M Weimer","Objective: Neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), consisting of intracellular aggregates of the tau protein, are a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here we report the identification and initial characterization of Genentech Tau Probe 1 ([18F]GTP1), a small-molecule PET probe for imaging tau pathology in AD patients.

Methods: Autoradiography using human brain tissues from AD donors and protein binding panels were used to determine [18F]GTP1 binding characteristics. Stability was evaluated in vitro and in vivo in mice and rhesus monkey. In the clinic, whole-body imaging was performed to assess biodistribution and dosimetry. Dynamic [18F]GTP1 brain imaging and input function measurement were performed on two separate days in 5 β-amyloid plaque positive (Aβ+) AD and 5 β-amyloid plaque negative (Aβ-) cognitive normal (CN) participants. Tracer kinetic modeling was applied and reproducibility was evaluated. SUVR was calculated and compared to [18F]GTP1-specific binding parameters derived from the kinetic modeling. [18F]GTP1 performance in a larger cross-sectional group of 60 Aβ+ AD participants and ten (Aβ- or Aβ+) CN was evaluated with images acquired 60 to 90 min post tracer administration.

Results: [18F]GTP1 exhibited high affinity and selectivity for tau pathology with no measurable binding to β-amyloid plaques or MAO-B in AD tissues, or binding to other tested proteins at an affinity predicted to impede image data interpretation. In human, [18F]GTP1 exhibited favorable dosimetry and brain kinetics, and no evidence of defluorination. [18F]GTP1-specific binding was observed in cortical regions of the brain predicted to contain tau pathology in AD and exhibited low (< 4%) test-retest variability. SUVR measured in the 60 to 90-min interval post injection correlated with tracer-specific binding (slope = 1.36, r2= 0.98). Furthermore, in a cross-sectional population, the degree of [18F]GTP1-specific binding increased with AD severity and could differentiate diagnostic cohorts.

Conclusions: [18F]GTP1 is a promising PET probe for the study of tau pathology in AD.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31254035/
Sigma-1 Agonist Binding in the Aging Rat Brain: a MicroPET Study with [(11)C]SA4503,"Nisha K Ramakrishnan, Anniek K D Visser, Anna A Rybczynska, Csaba J Nyakas, Paul G M Luiten, Chantal Kwizera, Jurgen W A Sijbesma, Philip H Elsinga, Kiichi Ishiwata, Rudi A J O Dierckx, Aren van Waarde","Purpose: Sigma-1 receptor ligands modulate the release of several neurotransmitters and intracellular calcium signaling. We examined the binding of a radiolabeled sigma-1 agonist in the aging rat brain with positron emission tomography (PET).

Procedures: Time-dependent uptake of [(11)C]SA4503 was measured in the brain of young (1.5 to 3 months) and aged (18 to 32 months) Wistar Hannover rats, and tracer-kinetic models were fitted to this data, using metabolite-corrected plasma radioactivity as input function.

Results: In aged animals, the injected probe was less rapidly metabolized and cleared. Logan graphical analysis and a 2-tissue compartment model (2-TCM) fit indicated changes of total distribution volume (V T) and binding potential (BP ND) of the tracer. BP ND was reduced particularly in the (hypo)thalamus, pons, and medulla.

Conclusions: Some areas showed reductions of ligand binding with aging whereas binding in other areas (cortex) was not significantly affected.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26637208/
68Ga-Citrate PET of Healthy Men: Whole-Body Biodistribution Kinetics and Radiation Dose Estimates,"Sami Suilamo, Xiang-Guo Li, Petteri Lankinen, Vesa Oikonen, Tuula Tolvanen, Pauliina Luoto, Riikka Viitanen, Antti Saraste, Marko Seppänen, Laura Pirilä, Ulla Hohenthal, Anne Roivainen","68Ga-citrate has one of the simplest chemical structures of all68Ga-radiopharmaceuticals, and its clinical use is justified by the proven medical applications using its isotope-labeled compound67Ga-citrate. To support broader application of68Ga-citrate in medical diagnosis, further research is needed to gain clinical data from healthy volunteers. In this work, we studied the biodistribution of68Ga-citrate and subsequent radiation exposure from it in healthy men.Methods:68Ga-citrate was prepared with an acetone-based radiolabeling procedure compliant with good manufacturing practices. Six healthy men (age 41 ± 12 y, mean ± SD) underwent sequential whole-body PET/CT scans after an injection of 204 ± 8 MBq of68Ga-citrate. Serial arterialized venous blood samples were collected during PET imaging, and the radioactivity concentration was measured with a γ-counter. Urinary voids were collected and measured. The MIRD bladder-voiding model with a 3.5-h voiding interval was used. A model using a 70-kg adult man and the MIRD schema was used to estimate absorbed doses in target organs and effective doses. Calculations were performed using OLINDA/EXM software, version 2.0.Results:Radioactivity clearance from the blood was slow, and relatively high radioactivity concentrations were observed over the whole of the 3-h measuring period. Although radioactivity excretion via urine was rather slow (biologic half-time, 69 ± 24 h), the highest decay-corrected concentrations in urinary bladder contents were measured at the 90- and 180-min time points. Moderate concentrations were also seen in kidneys, liver, and spleen. The source organs showing the largest residence times were muscle, liver, lung, and heart contents. The heart wall received the highest absorbed dose, 0.077 ± 0.008 mSv/MBq. The mean effective dose (International Commission on Radiological Protection publication 103) was 0.021 ± 0.001 mSv/MBq.Conclusion:PET imaging with68Ga-citrate is associated with modest radiation exposure. A 200-MBq injection of68Ga-citrate results in an effective radiation dose of 4.2 mSv, which is in the same range as other68Ga-labeled tracers. This suggests the feasibility of clinical studies using68Ga-citrate imaging in humans and the possibility of performing multiple scans in the same subjects across the course of a year.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35273093/
Modeling alternatives for cerebral carbon-11-iomazenil kinetics,"A Buck, G Westera, G K vonSchulthess, C Burger","The in vivo binding kinetics of [11C]iomazenil, a central benzodiazepine antagonist, were analyzed using PET and compartmental modeling. This method is of interest because it allows validation of the SPECT tracer [123I]iomazenil.

Methods: The experimental protocol consisted of serial PET imaging following a single bolus injection of the serial PET imaging following a single bolus injection of the radioligand. Imaging was performed on five healthy young volunteers over 106 min. The tissue time-activity curves of various brain regions were analyzed with models consisting of two (K1, k2"") and three (K1, k2', k3', k4) compartments. Some of the methods use simultaneous fitting of the data from multiple brain regions coupled with common parameters. Distribution volumes and k3-based parameters [(K1/k2') k3' and k3')] were chosen to represent receptor density. Goodness of fit was assessed with F-test statistics and chi-square analysis.

Results: Compared with the two-compartment model, goodness of fit was significantly improved by all three-compartment configurations. Of the three-compartment models, goodness of fit was similar for the configurations with K1/k2', k4 or no parameter coupled, and slightly worse when both parameters were coupled. The most reliable estimates of receptor density were obtained from the specific distribution volumes (DVs) calculated with the three-compartment model, and the coupling of k4 or both k4 and K1/k2'. Due to oversimplification of the kinetics, the DV values calculated with the two-compartment model were underestimated.

Conclusion: Reliable quantitative information regarding benzodiazepine receptor density following bolus injection of iomazenil is best obtained by tracer kinetic modeling that uses a three-compartment model and parameter coupling.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8691270/
Quantification of PD-L1 Expression with 18F-BMS-986192 PET/CT in Patients with Advanced-Stage Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer,"Marc C Huisman, Anna-Larissa N Niemeijer, Albert D Windhorst, Robert C Schuit, David Leung, Wendy Hayes, Alex Poot, Idris Bahce, Teodora Radonic, Daniela E Oprea-Lager, Otto S Hoekstra, Erik Thunnissen, N Harry Hendrikse, Egbert F Smit, Adrianus J de Langen, Ronald Boellaard","The aim of this work was to quantify the uptake of18F-BMS-986192, a programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) adnectin PET tracer, in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. To this end, plasma input kinetic modeling of dynamic tumor uptake data with online arterial blood sampling was performed. In addition, the accuracy of simplified uptake metrics such as SUV was investigated.Methods:Data from a study with18F-BMS-986192 in patients with advanced-stage non-small cell lung cancer eligible for nivolumab treatment were used if a dynamic scan was available and lesions were present in the field of view of the dynamic scan. After injection of18F-BMS-986192, a 60-min dynamic PET/CT scan was started, followed by a 30-min whole-body PET/CT scan. Continuous arterial and discrete arterial and venous blood sampling were performed to determine a plasma input function. Tumor time-activity curves were fitted by several plasma input kinetic models. Simplified uptake parameters included tumor-to-blood ratio as well as several SUV measures.Results:Twenty-two tumors in 9 patients were analyzed. The arterial plasma input single-tissue reversible compartment model with fitted blood volume fraction seems to be the most preferred model as it best fitted 11 of 18 tumor time-activity curves. The distribution volume (VT) ranged from 0.4 to 4.8 mL⋅cm-3Similar values were obtained with an image-derived input function. From the simplified measures, SUV normalized for body weight at 50 and 67 min after injection correlated best withVT, with anR2of more than 0.9.Conclusion:A single-tissue reversible model can be used to quantify tumor uptake of the PD-L1 PET tracer18F-BMS-986192. SUV at 60 min after injection, normalized for body weight, is an accurate simplified parameter for uptake assessment of baseline studies. To assess its predictive value for response evaluation during programmed cell death protein 1 or PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibition, further validation of SUV againstVTbased on an image-derived input function is recommended.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32060213/
PET and SPET tracers for mapping the cardiac nervous system,"Oliver Langer, Christer Halldin","The human cardiac nervous system consists of a sympathetic and a parasympathetic branch with (-)-norepinephrine and acetylcholine as the respective endogenous neurotransmitters. Dysfunction of the cardiac nervous system is implicated in various types of cardiac disease, such as heart failure, myocardial infarction and diabetic autonomic neuropathy. In vivo assessment of the distribution and function of cardiac sympathetic and parasympathetic neurones with positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission tomography (SPET) can be achieved by means of a number of carbon-11-, fluorine-18-, bromine-76- and iodine-123-labelled tracer molecules. Available tracers for mapping sympathetic neurones can be divided into radiolabelled catecholamines, such as 6-[18F]fluorodopamine, (-)-6-[18F]fluoronorepinephrine and (-)-[11C]epinephrine, and radiolabelled catecholamine analogues, such as [123I]meta-iodobenzylguanidine, [11C]meta-hydroxyephedrine, [18F]fluorometaraminol, [11C]phenylephrine and meta-[76Br]bromobenzylguanidine. Resistance to metabolism by monoamine oxidase and catechol-O-methyl transferase simplifies the myocardial kinetics of the second group. Both groups of compounds are excellent agents for an overall assessment of sympathetic innervation. Biomathematical modelling of tracer kinetics is complicated by the complexity of the steps governing neuronal uptake, retention and release of these agents as well as by their high neuronal affinity, which leads to partial flow dependence of uptake. Mapping of cardiac parasympathetic neurones is limited by a low density and focal distribution pattern of these neurones in myocardium. Available tracers are derivatives of vesamicol, a molecule that binds to a receptor associated with the vesicular acetylcholine transporter. Compounds like (-)-[18F]fluoroethoxybenzovesamicol display a high degree of non-specific binding in myocardium which restricts their utility for cardiac neuronal imaging.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12002720/
Improving SUVR quantification by correcting for radiotracer clearance in tissue,"Praveen Honhar, David Matuskey, Richard E Carson, Ansel T Hillmer","Standardized Uptake Value Ratio (SUVR) is a widely reported semi-quantitative positron emission tomography (PET) outcome measure, partly because of its ease of measurement from short scan durations. However, in brain,SUVRis often a biased estimator of the gold-standard distribution volume ratio (DVR) due to non-equilibrium conditions, i.e., clearance of the radiotracer in relevant tissues. Factors that affect radiotracer metabolism and clearance such as medication or subject groups could lead to artificial differences inSUVR. This work developed a correction that reduces the bias inSUVR(estimated from a short 15-30 min PET imaging session) by accounting for the effects of tracer clearance observed during the lateSUVRtime window. The proposed correction takes the form of a one-step non-linear algebraic transform ofSUVRthat is a function of radiotracer dependent parameters such as clearance rates from the reference and target tissues, and population averaged reference region clearance rate (). An important observation was the need for accurate estimation of radiotracer clearance rate in target tissue, which was addressed with a regression based model. Simulations and human data from two different radiotracers (healthy controls for [11C]LSN3172176, healthy controls and Parkinson's disease subjects for [18F]FE-PE2I) were used to validate the correction and evaluate its benefits and limitations.SUVRcorrection in human data significantly reduced meanSUVRbias across brain regions and subjects (from ∼25% forSUVRto <10% for correctedSUVR). This correction also significantly reduced the variability of this bias across brain regions for both tracers (approximately 50% for [11C]LSN3172176, 20% for [18F]FE-PE2I). Future work should investigate the benefits of using correctedSUVRin other populations and with different tracers.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37589538/
"Source-to-Target Automatic Rotating Estimation (STARE) - A publicly-available, blood-free quantification approach for PET tracers with irreversible kinetics: Theoretical framework and validation for [18F]FDG","Elizabeth A Bartlett, R Todd Ogden, J John Mann, Francesca Zanderigo","Introduction: Full quantification of positron emission tomography (PET) data requires an input function. This generally means arterial blood sampling, which is invasive, labor-intensive and burdensome. There is no current, standardized method to fully quantify PET radiotracers with irreversible kinetics in the absence of blood data. Here, we present Source-to-Target Automatic Rotating Estimation (STARE), a novel, data-driven approach to quantify the net influx rate (Ki) of irreversible PET radiotracers, that requires only individual-level PET data and no blood data. We validate STARE with human [18F]FDG PET scans and assess its performance using simulations.

Methods: STARE builds upon a source-to-target tissue model, where the tracer time activity curves (TACs) in multiple ""target"" regions are expressed at once as a function of a ""source"" region, based on the two-tissue irreversible compartment model, and separates target region Kifrom source Kiby fitting the source-to-target model across all target regions simultaneously. To ensure identifiability, data-driven, subject-specific anchoring is used in the STARE minimization, which takes advantage of the PET signal in a vasculature cluster in the field of view (FOV) that is automatically extracted and partial volume-corrected. To avoid the need for any a priori determination of a single source region, each of the considered regions acts in turn as the source, and a final Kiis estimated in each region by averaging the estimates obtained in each source rotation.

Results: In a large dataset of human [18F]FDG scans (N = 69), STARE Kiestimates were correlated with corresponding arterial blood-based Kiestimates (r = 0.80), with an overall regression slope of 0.88, and were precisely estimated, as assessed by comparing STARE Kiestimates across several runs of the algorithm (coefficient of variation across runs=6.74 ± 2.48%). In simulations, STARE Kiestimates were largely robust to factors that influence the individualized anchoring used within its algorithm.

Conclusion: Through simulations and application to [18F]FDG PET data, feasibility is demonstrated for STARE blood-free, data-driven quantification of Ki. Future work will include applying STARE to PET data obtained with a portable PET camera and to other irreversible radiotracers.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35026425/
Generalized whole-body Patlak parametric imaging for enhanced quantification in clinical PET,"Nicolas A Karakatsanis, Yun Zhou, Martin A Lodge, Michael E Casey, Richard L Wahl, Habib Zaidi, Arman Rahmim","We recently developed a dynamic multi-bed PET data acquisition framework to translate the quantitative benefits of Patlak voxel-wise analysis to the domain of routine clinical whole-body (WB) imaging. The standard Patlak (sPatlak) linear graphical analysis assumes irreversible PET tracer uptake, ignoring the effect of FDG dephosphorylation, which has been suggested by a number of PET studies. In this work: (i) a non-linear generalized Patlak (gPatlak) model is utilized, including a net efflux rate constant kloss, and (ii) a hybrid (s/g)Patlak (hPatlak) imaging technique is introduced to enhance contrast to noise ratios (CNRs) of uptake rate Ki images. Representative set of kinetic parameter values and the XCAT phantom were employed to generate realistic 4D simulation PET data, and the proposed methods were additionally evaluated on 11 WB dynamic PET patient studies. Quantitative analysis on the simulated Ki images over 2 groups of regions-of-interest (ROIs), with low (ROI A) or high (ROI B) true kloss relative to Ki, suggested superior accuracy for gPatlak. Bias of sPatlak was found to be 16-18% and 20-40% poorer than gPatlak for ROIs A and B, respectively. By contrast, gPatlak exhibited, on average, 10% higher noise than sPatlak. Meanwhile, the bias and noise levels for hPatlak always ranged between the other two methods. In general, hPatlak was seen to outperform all methods in terms of target-to-background ratio (TBR) and CNR for all ROIs. Validation on patient datasets demonstrated clinical feasibility for all Patlak methods, while TBR and CNR evaluations confirmed our simulation findings, and suggested presence of non-negligible kloss reversibility in clinical data. As such, we recommend gPatlak for highly quantitative imaging tasks, while, for tasks emphasizing lesion detectability (e.g. TBR, CNR) over quantification, or for high levels of noise, hPatlak is instead preferred. Finally, gPatlak and hPatlak CNR was systematically higher compared to routine SUV values.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26509251/
Model-independent plot of dynamic PET data facilitates data interpretation and model selection,Ole Lajord Munk,"When testing new PET radiotracers or new applications of existing tracers, the blood-tissue exchange and the metabolism need to be examined. However, conventional plots of measured time-activity curves from dynamic PET do not reveal the inherent kinetic information. A novel model-independent volume-influx plot (vi-plot) was developed and validated. The new vi-plot shows the time course of the instantaneous distribution volume and the instantaneous influx rate. The vi-plot visualises physiological information that facilitates model selection and it reveals when a quasi-steady state is reached, which is a prerequisite for the use of the graphical analyses by Logan and Gjedde-Patlak. Both axes of the vi-plot have direct physiological interpretation, and the plot shows kinetic parameter in close agreement with estimates obtained by non-linear kinetic modelling. The vi-plot is equally useful for analyses of PET data based on a plasma input function or a reference region input function. The vi-plot is a model-independent and informative plot for data exploration that facilitates the selection of an appropriate method for data analysis.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22094364/
The use and impact of positron computed tomography scanning in epilepsy,"J C Mazziotta, J Engel Jr","Through the effective combination of instrumentation, tracer kinetic principles, and radiopharmaceuticals, positron computed tomography (PET) allows for the analytic, noninvasive measurement of local tissue physiology in humans. A large number of studies have already been performed in patients with epilepsy using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) to measure local cerebral glucose utilization. In patients with complex partial epilepsy who are candidates for surgery, hypometabolic zones have been seen consistently (70%) in the interictal state. These areas of hypometabolism have been related to electroencephalographic findings, surgical pathology, and clinical symptomatology. The complex anatomical and pathophysiological investigation of these hypometabolic zones is discussed. Ictal studies of patients with partial seizures have demonstrated a much more variable metabolic pattern which usually consists of hypermetabolism relative to baseline or interictal studies. Generalized epilepsy produced by electroconvulsive shock and petit mal epilepsy have been studied using FDG to estimate glucose metabolism. These studies demonstrated hypermetabolism in the ictal state, relative to interictal or postictal scans, but with a more generalized pattern than ictal studies of partial seizures. Methodological problems in the study of epilepsy with PET are discussed in detail. The investigation of interictal hypometabolism through animal models of epilepsy and quantitative autoradiography is described as a means to understand the human PET results. The impact and future direction of PET studies in epileptic populations will probably employ the use of behavioral, pharmacological, and electrophysiological maneuvers to provide more specific details about the fundamental pathophysiological mechanisms of specific aspects of epilepsy. These techniques may allow for a truly pathophysiological classification system for the common and unusual types of epilepsy, and through this classification system improve the therapeutic and prognostic clinical approach to patients.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6430693/
Determination of Fatty Acid Metabolism with Dynamic [11C]Palmitate Positron Emission Tomography of Mouse Heart In Vivo,"Yinlin Li, Tao Huang, Xinyue Zhang, Min Zhong, Natalie N Walker, Jiang He, Stuart S Berr, Susanna R Keller, Bijoy K Kundu","The goal of this study was to establish a quantitative method for measuring fatty acid (FA) metabolism with partial volume (PV) and spill-over (SP) corrections using dynamic [(11)C]palmitate positron emission tomographic (PET) images of mouse heart in vivo. Twenty-minute dynamic [(11)C]palmitate PET scans of four 18- to 20-week-old male C57BL/6 mice under isoflurane anesthesia were performed using a Focus F-120 PET scanner. A model-corrected blood input function, by which the input function with SP and PV corrections and the metabolic rate constants (k1-k5) are simultaneously estimated from the dynamic [(11)C]palmitate PET images of mouse hearts in a four-compartment tracer kinetic model, was used to determine rates of myocardial fatty acid oxidation (MFAO), myocardial FA esterification, myocardial FA use, and myocardial FA uptake. The MFAO thus measured in C57BL/6 mice was 375.03 ± 43.83 nmol/min/g. This compares well to the MFAO measured in perfused working C57BL/6 mouse hearts ex vivo of about 350 nmol/g/min and 400 nmol/min/g. FA metabolism was measured for the first time in mouse heart in vivo using dynamic [(11)C]palmitate PET in a four-compartment tracer kinetic model.

In vivo PET quantification of the dopamine transporter in rat brain with [¹⁸F]LBT-999,"Sophie Sérrière, Clovis Tauber, Johnny Vercouillie, Denis Guilloteau, Jean-Bernard Deloye, Lucette Garreau, Laurent Galineau, Sylvie Chalon","Introduction: We examined whether [(18)F]LBT-999 ((E)-N-(4-fluorobut-2-enyl)2β-carbomethoxy-3β-(4'-tolyl)nortropane) is an efficient positron emission tomography (PET) tracer for the quantification of the dopamine transporter (DAT) in the healthy rat brain.

Methods: PET studies were performed using several experimental designs, i.e. test-retest, co-injection with different doses of unlabelled LBT, displacement with GBR12909 and pre-injection of amphetamine.

Results: The uptake of [(18)F]LBT-999 confirmed its specific binding to the DAT. The non-displaceable uptake (BP(ND)) in the striatum, between 5.37 and 4.39, was highly reproducible and reliable, and was decreased by 90% by acute injection of GBR12909. In the substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area (SN/VTA), the variability was higher and the reliability was lower. Pre-injection of amphetamine induced decrease of [(18)F]LBT-999 BP(ND) of 50% in the striatum.

Conclusions: [(18)F]LBT-999 allows the quantification of the DAT in living rat brain with high reproducibility, sensitivity and specificity. It could be used to quantify the DAT in rodent models, thereby allowing to study neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24210285/
Functional segmentation of dynamic PET studies: Open source implementation and validation of a leader-follower-based algorithm,"José María Mateos-Pérez, María Luisa Soto-Montenegro, Santiago Peña-Zalbidea, Manuel Desco, Juan José Vaquero","We present a novel segmentation algorithm for dynamic PET studies that groups pixels according to the similarity of their time-activity curves.

Methods: Sixteen mice bearing a human tumor cell line xenograft (CH-157MN) were imaged with three different (68)Ga-DOTA-peptides (DOTANOC, DOTATATE, DOTATOC) using a small animal PET-CT scanner. Regional activities (input function and tumor) were obtained after manual delineation of regions of interest over the image. The algorithm was implemented under the jClustering framework and used to extract the same regional activities as in the manual approach. The volume of distribution in the tumor was computed using the Logan linear method. A Kruskal-Wallis test was used to investigate significant differences between the manually and automatically obtained volumes of distribution.

Results: The algorithm successfully segmented all the studies. No significant differences were found for the same tracer across different segmentation methods. Manual delineation revealed significant differences between DOTANOC and the other two tracers (DOTANOC - DOTATATE, p=0.020; DOTANOC - DOTATOC, p=0.033). Similar differences were found using the leader-follower algorithm.

Conclusion: An open implementation of a novel segmentation method for dynamic PET studies is presented and validated in rodent studies. It successfully replicated the manual results obtained in small-animal studies, thus making it a reliable substitute for this task and, potentially, for other dynamic segmentation procedures.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26773940/
A Unified Framework for Plasma Data Modeling in Dynamic Positron Emission Tomography Studies,"Matteo Tonietto, Gaia Rizzo, Mattia Veronese, Faith Borgan, Peter S Bloomfield, Oliver Howes, Alessandra Bertoldo","Objective: Full quantification of dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) data requires the knowledge of tracer concentration in the arterial plasma. However, its accurate measurement is challenging due to the presence of radiolabeled metabolites and measurement noise. Mathematical models are fitted to the plasma data for both radiometabolite correction and data denoising. However, the models used are generally not physiologically informed and not consistently applied across studies even when quantifying the kinetics of the same radiotracer, introducing methodological variability affecting the results interpretation. The aim of this study was to develop and validate a unified framework for the arterial data modeling to achieve an accurate and fully automated description of the plasma tracer kinetics.

Methods: The proposed pipeline employs basis pursuit techniques for estimating both radiometabolites and parent concentration models from the raw plasma measurements, allowing the resulting algorithm to be both robust and flexible to the different quality of data available. The pipeline was tested on four PET tracers ([11C]PBR28, [11C]MePPEP, [11C]WAY-100635, and [11C]PIB) with continuous and discrete blood sampling.

Results: Compared to the standard procedure, the pipeline provided similar fit of the parent fraction but yielded a better description of the total plasma radioactivity, which in turn allowed a more accurate fit of the tissue PET data.

Conclusion: The new method showed superior fits compared to the standard pipeline, for both continuous and discrete arterial sampling protocol, yielding to better description of PET data.

Significance: The proposed pipeline has the potential to standardize the blood data modeling in dynamic PET studies given its robustness, flexibility and easiness of use.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30307849/

A range of kinetic models was investigated to identify an optimal kinetic analysis method for each radioligand and a suitable acquisition duration.Results:All 3 radioligands readily entered the brain and yielded heterogeneous uptake consistent with the known distribution of the targets. The optimal models determined for the regional estimates of volume of distribution were multilinear analysis 1 (MA1) and the 2-tissue-compartment model for18F-BCPP-EF, MA1 for11C-SA-4503, and both MA1 and the 1-tissue-compartment model for11C-UCB-J. Acquisition times of 70, 80, and 60 min for18F-BCPP-EF,11C-SA-4503,11C-UCB-J, respectively, provided good estimates of regional volume of distribution values. An effect of age was observed on18F-BCPP-EF and11C-UCB-J signal in the caudate.Conclusion:These ligands can be assessed for their potential to stratify patients or monitor the progression of molecular neuropathology in neurodegenerative diseases.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31324712/
Determining the optimal pharmacokinetic modelling and simplified quantification method of [18F]AlF-P16-093 for patients with primary prostate cancer (PPCa),"Ruiyue Zhao, Zeheng Xia, Miao Ke, Jie Lv, Huizhen Zhong, Yulu He, Di Gu, Yongda Liu, Guohua Zeng, Lin Zhu, David Alexoff, Hank F Kung, Xinlu Wang, Tao Sun","Purpose: This paper discusses the optimization of pharmacokinetic modelling and alternate simplified quantification method for [18F]AlF-P16-093, a novel tracer for in vivo imaging of prostate cancer.

Methods: Dynamic PET/CT scans were conducted on eight primary prostate cancer patients, followed by a whole-body scan at 60 min post-injection. Time-activity curves (TACs) were obtained by drawing volumes of interest for primary prostatic and metastatic lesions. Optimal kinetic modelling involved evaluating three compartmental models (1T2K, 2T3K, and 2T4K) accounting for fractional blood volume (Vb). The simplified quantification method was then determined based on the correlation between the static uptake measure and total distribution volume (Vt) obtained from the optimal pharmacokinetic analysis.

Results: In total, 17 intraprostatic lesions, 10 lymph nodes, and 36 osseous metastases were evaluated. Visually, the contrast of the tumor increased and showed the steepest incline within the first few minutes, whereas background activity decreased over time. Full pharmacokinetic analysis revealed that a reversible two-compartmental (2T4K) model is the preferred kinetic model for the given tracer. The kinetic parameters K1, k3, Vb, and Vtwere all significantly higher in lesions when compared with normal tissue (P < 0.01). Several simplified protocols were tested for approximating comprehensive dynamic quantification in tumors, with image-based SURmean (the ratio of tumor SUVmean to blood SUVmean) within the 28-34 min window found to be sufficient for approximating the total distribution Vtvalues (R2= 0.949, P < 0.01). Both Vtand SURmean correlated significantly with the total serum prostate-specific antigen (tPSA) levels (P < 0.01).

Conclusions: This study introduced an optimized pharmacokinetic modelling approach and a simplified acquisition method for [18F]AlF-P16-093, a novel PSMA-targeted radioligand, highlighting the feasibility of utilizing one static PET imaging (between 30 and 60 min) for the diagnosis of prostate cancer. Note that the image-derived input function in this study may not reflect the true corrected plasma input function, therefore the interpretation of the associated kinetic parameter estimates should be done with caution.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38285206/
Kinetic filtering of [(18)F]Fluorothymidine in positron emission tomography studies,"Katherine R Gray, Kaiyumars B Contractor, Laura M Kenny, Adil Al-Nahhas, Sami Shousha, Justin Stebbing, Harpreet S Wasan, R Charles Coombes, Eric O Aboagye, Federico E Turkheimer, Lula Rosso","[(18)F]Fluorothymidine (FLT) is a cell proliferation marker that undergoes predominantly hepatic metabolism and therefore shows a high level of accumulation in the liver, as well as in rapidly proliferating tumours. Furthermore, the tracer's uptake is substantial in other organs including the heart. We present a nonlinear kinetic filtering technique which enhances the visualization of tumours imaged with FLT positron emission tomography (FLT-PET). A classification algorithm to isolate cancerous tissue from healthy organs was developed and validated using 29 scan data from patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. A large reduction in signal from the liver and heart of 80% was observed following application of the kinetic filter, whilst the majority of signal from both primary tumours and metastases was retained. A scan acquisition time of 60 min has been shown to be sufficient to obtain the necessary kinetic data. The algorithm extends utility of FLT-PET imaging in oncology research.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20071760/
An extended simplified reference tissue model for the quantification of dynamic PET with amphetamine challenge,"Yun Zhou, Ming-Kai Chen, Christopher J Endres, Weiguo Ye, James R Brasić, Mohab Alexander, Andrew H Crabb, Tomás R Guilarte, Dean F Wong","Background: Equilibrium analysis to quantify dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) with bolus followed by continuous tracer infusion and acute amphetamine challenge assumes that all tissue kinetics attain steady states during pre- and post-challenge phases. Violations of this assumption may result in unreliable estimation of the amphetamine-induced percent change in the binding potential (DeltaBP%).

Method: We derived an extended simplified reference tissue model (ESRTM) for modeling tracer kinetics in the pre- and post-challenge phases. Ninety-minute [11C]raclopride PET studies with bolus injection followed by continuous tracer infusion were performed on 18 monkeys and 2 baboons. Forty minutes after the bolus injection, a single acute intravenous amphetamine administration was given of 2.0 mg/kg to monkeys and of 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, and 1.5 mg/kg to baboons. Computer simulations further evaluated and characterized the ESRTM.

Results: In monkey studies, the DeltaBP% estimated by the ESRTM was 32+/-11, whereas, the DeltaBP% obtained using the equilibrium methods was 32% to 81% lower. In baboon studies, the DeltaBP% values estimated with the ESRTM showed a linear relationship between the DeltaBP% and the natural logarithm of amphetamine dose (R2=0.96), where the DeltaBP%=10.67Ln(dose)+33.79 (0.05<or=dose in mg/kg<or=1.5). At 1.5 mg/kg amphetamine, the DeltaBP% estimates from equilibrium methods were 18% to 40% lower than those estimated by the ESRTM. Results showed that the nonsteady state of tracer kinetics produced an underestimation of the DeltaBP% from the equilibrium analysis. The accuracy of the DeltaBP% estimates from the equilibrium analysis was significantly improved by the ESRTM. The DeltaBP% estimated by the ESRTM in the study was consistent with that from previous [11C] raclopride PET with amphetamine challenge.

Conclusion: In conclusion, the ESRTM is a robust kinetic modeling approach and is proposed for the quantification of dynamic PET with acute amphetamine stimulation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16920365/
Comparative Evaluation of Three TSPO PET Radiotracers in a LPS-Induced Model of Mild Neuroinflammation in Rats,"Sujata Sridharan, Francois-Xavier Lepelletier, William Trigg, Samuel Banister, Tristan Reekie, Michael Kassiou, Alexander Gerhard, Rainer Hinz, Hervé Boutin","Purpose: Over the past 20 years, neuroinflammation (NI) has increasingly been recognised as having an important role in many neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. As such, being able to image NI non-invasively in patients is critical to monitor pathological processes and potential therapies targeting neuroinflammation. The translocator protein (TSPO) has proven a reliable NI biomarker for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. However, if TSPO imaging in acute conditions such as stroke provides strong and reliable signals, TSPO imaging in neurodegenerative diseases has proven more challenging. Here, we report results comparing the recently developed TSPO tracers [18F]GE-180 and [18F]DPA-714 with (R)-[11C]PK11195 in a rodent model of subtle focal inflammation.

Procedures: Adult male Wistar rats were stereotactically injected with 1 μg lipopolysaccharide in the right striatum. Three days later, animals underwent a 60-min PET scan with (R)-[11C]PK11195 and [18F]GE-180 (n = 6) or [18F]DPA-714 (n = 6). Ten animals were scanned with either [18F]GE-180 (n = 5) or [18F]DPA-714 (n = 5) only. Kinetic analysis of PET data was performed using the simplified reference tissue model (SRTM) with a contralateral reference region or a novel data-driven input to estimate binding potential BPND. Autoradiography and immunohistochemistry were performed to confirm in vivo results.

Results: At 40-60 min post-injection, [18F]GE-180 dual-scanned animals showed a significantly increased core/contralateral uptake ratio vs. the same animals scanned with (R)-[11C]PK11195 (3.41 ± 1.09 vs. 2.43 ± 0.39, p = 0.03); [18]DPA-714 did not (2.80 ± 0.69 vs. 2.26 ± 0.41). Kinetic modelling with a contralateral reference region identified significantly higher binding potential (BPND) in the core of the LPS injection site with [18F]GE-180 but not with [18F]DPA-714 vs. (R)-[11C]PK11195. A cerebellar reference region and novel data-driven input to the SRTM were unable to distinguish differences in tracer BPND.

Conclusions: Second-generation TSPO-PET tracers are able to accurately detect mild-level NI. In this model, [18F]GE-180 shows a higher core/contralateral ratio and BPNDwhen compared to (R)-[11C]PK11195, while [18F]DPA-714 did not.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27481358/
Spatiotemporal learning of dynamic positron emission tomography data improves diagnostic accuracy in breast cancer,"Marianna Inglese, Andrea Duggento, Tommaso Boccato, Matteo Ferrante, Nicola Toschi","Positron emission tomography (PET) can reveal metabolic activity in a voxelwise manner. PET analysis is commonly performed in a static manner by analyzing the standardized uptake value (SUV) obtained from the plateau region of PET acquisitions. A dynamic PET acquisition can provide a map of the spatiotemporal concentration of the tracer in vivo, hence conveying information about radiotracer delivery to tissue, its interaction with the target and washout. Therefore, tissue-specific biochemical properties are embedded in the shape of time activity curves (TACs), which are generally used for kinetic analysis. Conventionally, TACs are employed along with information about blood plasma activity concentration, i.e., the arterial input function (AIF), and specific compartmental models to obtain a full quantitative analysis of PET data. The main drawback of this approach is the need for invasive procedures requiring arterial blood sample collection during the whole PET scan. In this paper, we address the challenge of improving PET diagnostic accuracy through an alternative approach based on the analysis of time signal intensity patterns. Specifically, we demonstrate the diagnostic potential of tissue TACs provided by dynamic PET acquisition using various deep learning models. Our framework is shown to outperform the discriminative potential of classical SUV analysis, hence paving the way for more accurate PET-based lesion discrimination without additional acquisition time or invasive procedures. Clinical Relevance- The diagnostic accuracy of dynamic PET data exploited by deep-learning based time signal intensity pattern analysis is superior to that of static SUV imaging.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36086343/
PET: a biological imaging technique,M E Phelps,"Like in vivo autoradiography, PET provides a means to image and measure rates of biological processes throughout the distributed and interrelated systems of the entire living brain. In addition, both techniques can track and image the functional interactions of the brain with other systems throughout the entire body.

The expanding number of labeled compounds (greater than 500) is providing a growing number of biological assays (i.e., substrate metabolism, pre and post synaptic processes, enzyme activity, interaction of medical and illicit drugs with biological systems of the brain, immune system, membrane processes). Studies of normal cerebral function focus on mapping evoked responses of various components of motor, visual, somatosensory, memory and cognitive functions.

Kinetic Modelling of [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-Siglec-9 in Porcine Osteomyelitis and Soft Tissue Infections,"Lars Jødal, Anne Roivainen, Vesa Oikonen, Sirpa Jalkanen, Søren B Hansen, Pia Afzelius, Aage K O Alstrup, Ole L Nielsen, Svend B Jensen","Background: [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-Siglec-9 is a positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand for vascular adhesion protein 1 (VAP-1), a protein involved in leukocyte trafficking. The tracer facilitates the imaging of inflammation and infection. Here, we studied the pharmacokinetic modelling of [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-Siglec-9 in osteomyelitis and soft tissue infections in pigs.

Methods: Eight pigs with osteomyelitis and soft tissue infections in the right hind limb were dynamically PET scanned for 60 min along with arterial blood sampling. The fraction of radioactivity in the blood accounted for by the parent tracer was evaluated with radio-high-performance liquid chromatography. One- and two-tissue compartment models were used for pharmacokinetic evaluation. Post-mortem soft tissue samples from one pig were analysed with anti-VAP-1 immunofluorescence. In each analysis, the animal's non-infected left hind limb was used as a control.

Results: Tracer uptake was elevated in soft tissue infections but remained low in osteomyelitis. The kinetics of [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-Siglec-9 followed a reversible 2-tissue compartment model. The tracer metabolized quickly; however, taking this into account, produced more ambiguous results. Infected soft tissue samples showed endothelial cell surface expression of the Siglec-9 receptor VAP-1.

Conclusion: The kinetics of [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-Siglec-9 uptake in porcine soft tissue infections are best described by the 2-tissue compartment model.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31766140/
Graphics processing unit (GPU)-accelerated particle filter framework for positron emission tomography image reconstruction,"Fengchao Yu, Huafeng Liu, Zhenghui Hu, Pengcheng Shi","As a consequence of the random nature of photon emissions and detections, the data collected by a positron emission tomography (PET) imaging system can be shown to be Poisson distributed. Meanwhile, there have been considerable efforts within the tracer kinetic modeling communities aimed at establishing the relationship between the PET data and physiological parameters that affect the uptake and metabolism of the tracer. Both statistical and physiological models are important to PET reconstruction. The majority of previous efforts are based on simplified, nonphysical mathematical expression, such as Poisson modeling of the measured data, which is, on the whole, completed without consideration of the underlying physiology. In this paper, we proposed a graphics processing unit (GPU)-accelerated reconstruction strategy that can take both statistical model and physiological model into consideration with the aid of state-space evolution equations. The proposed strategy formulates the organ activity distribution through tracer kinetics models and the photon-counting measurements through observation equations, thus making it possible to unify these two constraints into a general framework. In order to accelerate reconstruction, GPU-based parallel computing is introduced. Experiments of Zubal-thorax-phantom data, Monte Carlo simulated phantom data, and real phantom data show the power of the method. Furthermore, thanks to the computing power of the GPU, the reconstruction time is practical for clinical application.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22472843/
Quantitative analysis and parametric imaging of 18F-labeled monomeric and dimeric RGD peptides using compartment model,"Ning Guo, Lixin Lang, Haokao Gao, Gang Niu, Dale O Kiesewetter, Qingguo Xie, Xiaoyuan Chen","Purpose: Non-invasive PET imaging with radiolabeled RGD peptides for α(v)β(3) integrin targeting has become an important tool for tumor diagnosis and treatment monitoring in both pre-clinical and clinical studies. To better understand the molecular process and tracer pharmacokinetics, we introduced kinetic modeling in the investigation of (18)F-labeled RGD peptide monomer (18)F-FP-c(RGDyK) (denoted as (18)F-FPRGD) and dimer (18)F-FP-PEG3-E[c(RGDyK)](2) (denoted as (18)F-FPPRGD2).

Procedures: MDA-MB-435 tumor-bearing mice underwent 60 min dynamic PET scans following the injection of either (18)F-FPRGD or (18)F-FPPRGD2. Blocking studies with pre-injection of a blocking mass dose were performed for both monomeric and dimeric RGD groups. (18)F-FPRAD (RAD) was used as a negative control. Kinetic parameters (K(1), k(2), k(3), k(4)) of a three-compartment model were fitted to the dynamic data to allow quantitative comparisons between the monomeric and dimeric RGD peptides.

Results: Dimeric RGD peptide tracer showed significantly higher binding potential (Bp(ND) = k(3)/k(4), 5.87 ± 0.31) than that of the monomeric analog (2.75 ± 0.48, p = 0.0022, n = 4/group). The Bp(ND) values showed a significantly greater ratio (dimer/monomer ~2.1) than the difference in %ID/g uptake measured from static images (dimer/monomer ~1.5, p = 0.0045). Significant decrease in Bp(ND) was found in the blocked groups compared with the unblocked ones (dimer p = 0.00024, monomer p = 0.005, n = 4/group). Similarly, the RAD control group showed the lowest Bp(ND) value among all the test groups, as the RAD peptide does not bind to integrin α(v)β(3). Volume of distribution (V(T) = K(1)/k (2)(1 + k (3)/k (4))) could be separated into non-specific (V (ND) = K (1)/k (2)) and specific (V (S) = K (1) k (3)/(k (2) k (4))) components. Specific distribution volume (V(S)) was the dominant component of V(T) in the unblocked groups and decreased in the blocked groups. Unblocked RGD dimer also showed higher V(S) than that of the monomer (dimer V(S) = 2.38 ± 0.15, monomer V(S) = 0.90 ± 0.17, p = 0.0013, n = 4/group), well correlated with Bp(ND) calculations. Little difference in V(ND) was found among all groups. Moreover, parametric maps allowed quantitative analysis at voxel level and provided higher tumor-to-background contrast for Bp(ND) maps than the static images. Tumor heterogeneity in kinetic parameters was found in parametric images, which could not be clearly identified in static intensity images.

Conclusions: The pharmacokinetics of both monomeric and dimeric RGD peptide tracers was compared, and the RGD dimers showed significantly higher binding affinity than the monomeric analogs. Kinetic parameters were demonstrated to be valuable for separating specific and non-specific binding and may allow more sensitive and detailed quantification than simple standardized uptake value analysis.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22437879/
A new tool for molecular imaging: the microvolumetric beta blood counter,"Laurence Convert, Guillaume Morin-Brassard, Jules Cadorette, Mélanie Archambault, M'hamed Bentourkia, Roger Lecomte","Radiotracer kinetic modeling in small animals with PET allows absolute quantification of physiologic and biochemical processes in vivo. It requires blood and tissue tracer concentrations as a function of time. Manual sampling, the reference method for blood tracer concentration measurements, requires fairly large amounts of blood besides being technically difficult and time-consuming. An automated microvolumetric beta blood counter (microBC) was designed to circumvent these limitations by measuring the blood activity in real time with PET scanning.

Methods: The microBC uses direct beta-particle detection to reduce its footprint and is entirely remote controlled for sampling protocol selection and real-time monitoring of measured parameters. Sensitivity has been determined for the most popular PET radioisotopes ((18)F, (13)N, (11)C, (64)Cu). Dispersion within the sampling catheter has been modeled to enable automatic correction. Blood curves obtained with the microBC were compared with manual samples and PET-derived data. The microBC was used to estimate the myocardial blood flow (MBF) of mice injected with (13)N-ammonia and to compare the myocardial metabolic rate of glucose (MMRG) of rats injected with (18)F-FDG for arterial and venous cannulation sites.

Results: The sensitivity limit ranges from 3 to 104 Bq/microL, depending on the isotope and the catheter used, and was found to be adequate for most small-animal studies. Automatic dispersion correction appears to be a good approximation of dispersion-free reference curves. Blood curves sampled with the microBC are well correlated with curves obtained from manual samples and PET images. With correction for dispersion, the MBF of anesthetized mice at rest was found to be 4.84 +/- 0.5 mL/g/min, which is comparable to values found in the literature for rats. MMRG values derived from the venous blood tracer concentration are underestimated by 60% as compared with those derived from arterial blood.

Conclusion: The microBC is a compact automated counter allowing real-time measurement of blood radioactivity for pharmacokinetic studies in animals as small as mice. Reliable and reproducible, the device makes it possible to increase the throughput of pharmacokinetic studies with reduced blood sample handling and staff exposure, contributing to speed up new drug development and evaluation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17574990/
Assessing radiotracer kinetics in the Langendorff perfused heart,"Erika Mariotti, Mattia Veronese, Joel T Dunn, Rodolfo A Medina, Philip J Blower, Richard Southworth, Thomas R Eykyn","Background: The Langendorff perfused heart is a physiologically relevant and controllable model with potential for assessing the pharmacokinetics of new radiotracers under a range of pathophysiological conditions.. We assess the feasibility of extending the methods validated for in vivo PET data analysis to the characterisation of PET tracer kinetics applied to Langendorff perfused hearts.

Methods: Monte Carlo simulations were used to study the accuracy and reproducibility of linear and non-linear spectral analysis (SA/NLSA), the Patlak graphical method and normalised tissue activity (NA). The methods were used to analyse time-activity curves of two widely used PET tracers, [18 F]-FDG and [18 F]-FMISO, acquired ex vivo from Langendorff perfused rat hearts under normoxic and hypoxic conditions.

Results: Monte Carlo simulations showed NLSA to be superior to SA in identifying and quantifying the presence of irreversible trapping component (αo), for low values of αo. The performance of NLSA and SA for high values of trapping was comparable. NLSA was also more precise than SA in determining the absence of trapping over the range of simulated kinetics and SNR. Simulations also suggest that the semi-quantitative method NA is adequate for the evaluation of trapping, and it was found to be more accurate than Patlak. The values of α0 estimated with NLSA from the time series of both [18 F]-FDG and [18 F]-FMISO increased significantly from normoxia to hypoxia in agreement with previous studies. The values of trapping derived using SA increased but not significantly, reflecting the larger error associate with this method. Patlak estimated from the experimental datasets increased from normoxia to hypoxia but was not significant. NA estimated from the [18 F]-FDG data increased from normoxia to hypoxia, but was not significant, whilst NA calculated for [18 F]-FMISO time-activity curves increased significantly.

Conclusions: Monte Carlo simulations suggested that spectral-based quantitative analysis methods are adequate for the kinetic characterisation of time-activity curves acquired ex vivo from perfused hearts. The uptake rate Patlak and the index NA also represent a good alternative to the SA and NLSA algorithms when the aim of the kinetic analysis is to measure changes in the amount of tracer trapped in the irreversible compartment in response to external stimuli. For low levels of trapping, NLSA and NA were subject to lower errors than SA and Patlak, respectively.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24225195/
Practical Clinical Measurement of Radiotracer Concentration in Blood: Initial Device Concept and Feasibility Testing,"Josh Knowland, Ronald Lattanze, Jesse Kingg, Steven Perrin","Kinetic analysis of PET data requires continuous measurement of radioactivity in the arterial blood throughout the acquisition time, termed the arterial input function. The arterial input function is used as an input to compartmental modeling, which can be a better predictor of disease progression than SUV measurements from static PET images. Current common methods of measuring blood concentrations include image-derived, population-based, and manual sampling. These all have challenges due to logistical and technologic issues, as well as patient burden. The aim of this study was to design, develop, and assess a device that is practical and effective for the routine measurement of β-emitting radiotracer concentration in blood without the drawbacks of current methods and for which metabolite analysis is not required.Methods:Designs that integrated a scintillating fiber and a silicon photomultiplier with a general-purpose venous access catheter for in vivo measurement were considered. Other design requirements included miniaturization, high sampling rates, and stopping power for β-particles. Preliminary prototypes were designed to test the feasibility of the concept. Phantom tests were developed to mimic human vasculature. Tests of linearity, sensitivity, signal-to-noise ratios, the impact of vein diameter, and the influence of γ-radiation were conducted.Results:Prototype sensors were constructed using 2 different diameters of polystyrene-based scintillating fibers. Fibers were custom-polished and fixed to a silicon photomultiplier. Sensor output was linear, withR2= 0.999 over the range from 0.037 to 9.25 MBq/mL. Absolute sensitivity was approximately 450 counts per second per MBq/mL. Measured signal-to-noise ratios ranged from 1.2:1 to 3.2:1 using a blood-to-tissue concentration ratio of 1:1. Sensor output increased with vein diameter and showed no sensitivity to γ-radiation.Conclusion:In experiments with phantom models, the prototype provided accurate measurements of β-emitting radiotracer concentration. The design will be refined for in vivo testing. The ability to routinely gather blood input function data would facilitate the adoption of kinetic modeling of PET data.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30139882/
Model selection criteria for dynamic brain PET studies,"Sandeep S V Golla, Sofie M Adriaanse, Maqsood Yaqub, Albert D Windhorst, Adriaan A Lammertsma, Bart N M van Berckel, Ronald Boellaard","Background: Several criteria exist to identify the optimal model for quantification of tracer kinetics. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the correspondence in kinetic model preference identification for brain PET studies among five model selection criteria: Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), AIC unbiased (AICC), model selection criterion (MSC), Schwartz Criterion (SC), and F-test.

Materials and methods: Six tracers were evaluated: [11C]FMZ, [11C]GMOM, [11C]PK11195, [11C]Raclopride, [18F]FDG, and [11C]PHT, including data from five subjects per tracer. Time activity curves (TACs) were analysed using six plasma input models: reversible single-tissue model (1T2k), irreversible two-tissue model (2T3k), and reversible two-tissue model (2T4k), all with and without blood volume fraction parameter (VB). For each tracer and criterion, the percentage of TACs preferring a certain model was calculated.

Results: For all radiotracers, strong agreement was seen across the model selection criteria. The F-test was considered as the reference, as it is a frequently used hypothesis test. The F-test confirmed the AIC preferred model in 87% of all cases. The strongest (but minimal) disagreement across regional TACs was found when comparing AIC with AICC. Despite these regional discrepancies, same preferred kinetic model was obtained using all criteria, with an exception of one FMZ subject.

Conclusion: In conclusion, all five model selection criteria resulted in similar conclusions with only minor differences that did not affect overall model selection.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29209862/
Propagation of Blood Function Errors to the Estimates of Kinetic Parameters with Dynamic PET,"Yafang Cheng, Imam Şamil Yetik","Dynamic PET, in contrast to static PET, can identify temporal variations in the radiotracer concentration. Mathematical modeling of the tissue of interest in dynamic PET can be simplified using compartment models as a linear system where the time activity curve of a specific tissue is the convolution of the tracer concentration in the plasma and the impulse response of the tissue containing kinetic parameters. Since the arterial sampling of blood to acquire the value of tracer concentration is invasive, blind methods to estimate both blood input function and kinetic parameters have recently drawn attention. Several methods have been developed, but the effect of accuracy of the estimated blood function on the estimation of the kinetic parameters is not studied. In this paper, we present a method to compute the error in the kinetic parameter estimates caused by the error in the blood input function. Computer simulations show that analytical expressions we derive are sufficiently close to results obtained from numerical methods. Our findings are important to observe the effect of the blood function on kinetic parameter estimation, but also useful to evaluate various blind methods and observe the dependence of kinetic parameter estimates to certain parts of the blood function.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21127711/
First-in-human PET quantification study of cerebral α4β2* nicotinic acetylcholine receptors using the novel specific radioligand (-)-[(18)F]Flubatine,"Osama Sabri, Georg-Alexander Becker, Philipp M Meyer, Swen Hesse, Stephan Wilke, Susanne Graef, Marianne Patt, Julia Luthardt, Gudrun Wagenknecht, Alexander Hoepping, René Smits, Annegret Franke, Bernhard Sattler, Bernd Habermann, Petra Neuhaus, Steffen Fischer, Solveig Tiepolt, Winnie Deuther-Conrad, Henryk Barthel, Peter Schönknecht, Peter Brust","α4β2* nicotinic receptors (α4β2* nAChRs) could provide a biomarker in neuropsychiatric disorders (e.g., Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, depressive disorders, and nicotine addiction). However, there is a lack of α4β2* nAChR specific PET radioligands with kinetics fast enough to enable quantification of nAChR within a reasonable time frame. Following on from promising preclinical results, the aim of the present study was to evaluate for the first time in humans the novel PET radioligand (-)-[(18)F]Flubatine, formerly known as (-)-[(18)F]NCFHEB, as a tool for α4β2* nAChR imaging and in vivo quantification. Dynamic PET emission recordings lasting 270min were acquired on an ECAT EXACT HR+ scanner in 12 healthy male non-smoking subjects (71.0±5.0years) following the intravenous injection of 353.7±9.4MBq of (-)-[(18)F]Flubatine. Individual magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed for co-registration. PET frames were motion-corrected, before the kinetics in 29 brain regions were characterized using 1- and 2-tissue compartment models (1TCM, 2TCM). Given the low amounts of metabolite present in plasma, we tested arterial input functions with and without metabolite corrections. In addition, pixel-based graphical analysis (Logan plot) was used. The model's goodness of fit, with and without metabolite correction was assessed by Akaike's information criterion. Model parameters of interest were the total distribution volume VT (mL/cm(3)), and the binding potential BPND relative to the corpus callosum, which served as a reference region. The tracer proved to have high stability in vivo, with 90% of the plasma radioactivity remaining as untransformed parent compound at 90min, fast brain kinetics with rapid uptake and equilibration between free and receptor-bound tracer. Adequate fits of brain TACs were obtained with the 1TCM. VT could be reliably estimated within 90min for all regions investigated, and within 30min for low-binding regions such as the cerebral cortex. The rank order of VT by region corresponded well with the known distribution of α4β2* receptors (VT [thalamus] 27.4±3.8, VT [putamen] 12.7±0.9, VT [frontal cortex] 10.0±0.8, and VT [corpus callosum] 6.3±0.8). The BPND, which is a parameter of α4β2* nAChR availability, was 3.41±0.79 for the thalamus, 1.04±0.25 for the putamen and 0.61±0.23 for the frontal cortex, indicating high specific tracer binding. Use of the arterial input function without metabolite correction resulted in a 10% underestimation in VT, and was without important biasing effects on BPND. Altogether, kinetics and imaging properties of (-)-[(18)F]Flubatine appear favorable and suggest that (-)-[(18)F]Flubatine is a very suitable and clinically applicable PET tracer for in vivo imaging of α4β2* nAChRs in neuropsychiatric disorders.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26037057/
Methodologic Considerations for Quantitative 18F-FDG PET/CT Studies of Hepatic Glucose Metabolism in Healthy Subjects,"Malene Trägårdh, Niels Møller, Michael Sørensen","PET with the glucose analog (18)F-FDG is used to measure regional tissue metabolism of glucose. However, (18)F-FDG may have affinities different from those of glucose for plasma membrane transporters and intracellular enzymes; the lumped constant (LC) can be used to correct these differences kinetically. The aims of this study were to investigate the feasibility of measuring human hepatic glucose metabolism with dynamic (18)F-FDG PET/CT and to determine an operational LC for (18)F-FDG by comparison with (3)H-glucose measurements.

Methods: Eight healthy human subjects were included. In all studies, (18)F-FDG and (3)H-glucose were mixed in saline and coadministered. A 60-min dynamic PET recording of the liver was performed for 180 min with blood sampling from catheters in a hepatic vein and a radial artery (concentrations of (18)F-FDG and (3)H-glucose in blood). Hepatic blood flow was determined by indocyanine green infusion. First, 3 subjects underwent studies comparing bolus administration and constant-infusion administration of tracers during hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamping. Next, 5 subjects underwent studies comparing fasting and hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamping with tracer infusions. Splanchnic extraction fractions of (18)F-FDG (E*) and (3)H-glucose (E) were calculated from concentrations in blood, and the LC was calculated as ln(1 - E*)/ln(1 - E). Volumes of interest were drawn in the liver tissue, and hepatic metabolic clearance of (18)F-FDG (mL of blood/100 mL of liver tissue/min) was estimated.

Results: For bolus versus infusion, E* values were always negative when (18)F-FDG was administered as a bolus and were always positive when it was administered as an infusion. For fasting versus clamping, E* values were positive in 4 of 5 studies during fasting and were always positive during clamping. Negative extraction fractions were ascribed to the tracer distribution in the large volume of distribution in the prehepatic splanchnic bed. The LC ranged from 0.43 to 2.53, with no significant difference between fasting and clamping.

Conclusion: The large volume of distribution of (18)F-FDG in the prehepatic splanchnic bed may complicate the analysis of dynamic PET data because it represents the mixed tracer input to the liver via the portal vein. Therefore, dynamic (18)F-FDG data for human hepatic glucose metabolism should be interpreted with caution, but constant tracer infusion seems to yield more robust results than bolus injection.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26159590/
"Kinetic evaluation and test-retest reproducibility of [11C]UCB-J, a novel radioligand for positron emission tomography imaging of synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A in humans","Sjoerd J Finnema, Nabeel B Nabulsi, Joël Mercier, Shu-Fei Lin, Ming-Kai Chen, David Matuskey, Jean-Dominique Gallezot, Shannan Henry, Jonas Hannestad, Yiyun Huang, Richard E Carson","Synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A) is ubiquitously present in presynaptic terminals. Here we report kinetic modeling and test-retest reproducibility assessment of the SV2A positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand [11C]UCB-J in humans. Five volunteers were examined twice on the HRRT after bolus injection of [11C]UCB-J. Arterial blood samples were collected for measurements of radiometabolites and free fraction. Regional time-activity curves were analyzed with 1-tissue (1T) and 2-tissue (2T) compartment models to estimate volumes of distribution ( VT). Parametric maps were generated using the 1T model. [11C]UCB-J metabolized fairly quickly, with parent fraction of 36 ± 13% at 15 min after injection. Plasma free fraction was 32 ± 1%. Regional time-activity curves displayed rapid kinetics and were well described by the 1T model, except for the cerebellum and hippocampus. VTvalues estimated with the 2T model were similar to 1T values. Parametric maps were of high quality and VTvalues correlated well with time activity curve (TAC)-based estimates. Shortening of acquisition time from 120 min to 60 min had a negligible effect on VTvalues. The mean absolute test-retest reproducibility for VTwas 3-9% across regions. In conclusion, [11C]UCB-J exhibited excellent PET tracer characteristics and has potential as a general purpose tool for measuring synaptic density in neurodegenerative disorders.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28792356/
"68Ga-DOTA chelate, a novel imaging agent for assessment of myocardial perfusion and infarction detection in a rodent model","Anu Autio, Sauli Uotila, Max Kiugel, Ville Kytö, Heidi Liljenbäck, Nobuyuki Kudomi, Vesa Oikonen, Olli Metsälä, Semi Helin, Juhani Knuuti, Antti Saraste, Anne Roivainen","Background: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with Gadolinium 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-N',N″,N''',N″″-tetraacetic acid (Gd-DOTA) enables assessment of myocardial perfusion during first-pass of the contrast agent, while increased retention can signify areas of myocardial infarction (MI). We studied whether Gallium-68-labeled analog,68Ga-DOTA, can be used to assess myocardial perfusion on positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) in rats, comparing it with11C-acetate.

Methods: Rats were studied with11C-acetate and68Ga-DOTA at 24 hours after permanent ligation of the left coronary artery or sham operation. One-tissue compartmental models were used to estimate myocardial perfusion in normal and infarcted myocardium. After the PET scan, hearts were sectioned for autoradiographic detection of68Ga-DOTA distribution.

Results: 11C-acetate PET showed perfusion defects and histology showed myocardial necrosis in all animals after coronary ligation. Kinetic modeling of68Ga-DOTA showed significantly higher k1values in normal myocardium than in infarcted areas. There was a significant correlation (r = 0.82, P = 0.001) between k1values obtained with68Ga-DOTA and11C-acetate. After 10 minutes of tracer distribution, the68Ga-DOTA concentration was significantly higher in the infarcted than normal myocardium on PET imaging and autoradiography.

Conclusions: Our results indicate that acute MI can be detected as reduced perfusion, as well as increased late retention of68Ga-DOTA.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31144229/
Evaluation of 68Ga-labeled tracers for PET imaging of myocardial perfusion in pigs,"Miikka Tarkia, Antti Saraste, Tiina Saanijoki, Vesa Oikonen, Tommi Vähäsilta, Marjatta Strandberg, Christoffer Stark, Tuula Tolvanen, Mika Teräs, Timo Savunen, Mark A Green, Juhani Knuuti, Anne Roivainen","Purpose: We evaluated four potential gallium-68 (68Ga)-labeled tracers for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of myocardial perfusion in comparison with oxygen-15-labeled water ([15O]water) in healthy pigs. Four hexadentate salicylaldimine ligands derived from bis(3-aminopropyl)ethylenediamine (BAPEN) that showed promise in previous rat experiments were selected for this study.

Methods: Following an evaluation of myocardial blood flow with [15O]water PET, the pigs (total n=14) underwent a dynamic 90-min PET study with one of four 68Ga-labeled BAPEN derivatives (n=3-5 per tracer) either at rest or under adenosine stress. Serial arterial blood samples were collected during the imaging for the measurements of total radioactivity, radiometabolites, plasma protein binding and blood-to-plasma ratio for the 68Ga chelates. Time-activity curves of the left ventricular blood pool and myocardium were derived from PET images, and metabolite-corrected arterial input function was used for kinetic modeling. Also, ex vivo biodistribution of 68Ga radioactivity was analyzed.

Results: All four 68Ga tracers showed undesirably slow myocardial accumulation over time, but their in vivo stability, clearance from blood and the kinetics of the myocardium uptake varied. [68Ga][Ga-(sal)2BAPDMEN]1+ showed the highest myocardial uptake in PET images and tissue samples (myocardium-to-blood ratio 7.63±1.89, myocardium-to-lung ratio 3.03±0.33 and myocardium-to-liver ratio 1.80±0.82). However, there was no correlation between the myocardial perfusion measured with [15O]water and the net uptake rates or K1 values of the 68Ga chelates.

Conclusion: Our results revealed that myocardial accumulation of the 68Ga chelates proposed for myocardial perfusion imaging with PET was slow and not determined by myocardial perfusion in a large animal model. These findings suggest that the studied tracers are not suitable for clinical imaging of myocardial perfusion.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22264857/
Measurement of cerebral monoamine oxidase B activity using L-[11C]deprenyl and dynamic positron emission tomography,"A A Lammertsma, C J Bench, G W Price, J E Cremer, S K Luthra, D Turton, N D Wood, R S Frackowiak","A tracer kinetic procedure was developed for the measurement of monoamine oxidase type B (MAO-B) activity using L-[11C]deprenyl and positron emission tomography (PET). The kinetic model consisted of two tissue compartments with irreversible binding to the second compartment (three rate constants). In addition, a blood volume component was included. Special attention was given to the accurate measurement of the plasma and whole blood input functions. The method was applied to the measurement of the dose-response curve of a reversible MAO-B inhibitor (Ro 19-6327). From the results, it followed that the rate constant for irreversible binding (k3) appeared to be a better index of MAO-B activity than the net influx constant Ki. Furthermore, regional analysis demonstrated that Ki, but not k3, was flow dependent. This implies that full kinetic analysis is required for an accurate assessment of MAO-B activity.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1904879/
Self-supervised parametric map estimation for multiplexed PET with a deep image prior,"Bolin Pan, Paul K Marsden, Andrew J Reader","Multiplexed positron emission tomography (mPET) imaging allows simultaneous observation of physiological and pathological information from multiple tracers in a single PET scan. Although supervised deep learning has demonstrated superior performance in mPET image separation compared to purely model-based methods, acquiring large amounts of paired single-tracer data and multi-tracer data for training poses a practical challenge and needs extended scan durations for patients. In addition, the generalisation ability of the supervised learning framework is a concern, as the patient being scanned and their tracer kinetics may potentially fall outside the training distribution. In this work, we propose a self-supervised learning framework based on the deep image prior (DIP) for mPET image separation using just one dataset. In particular, we integrate the multi-tracer compartmental model into the DIP framework to estimate the parametric maps of each tracer from the measured dynamic dual-tracer activity images. Consequently, the separated dynamic single-tracer activity images can be recovered from the estimated tracer-specific parametric maps. In the proposed method, dynamic dual-tracer activity images are used as the training label, and the static dual-tracer image (reconstructed from the same patient data from the start to the end of acquisition) is used as the network input. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated on a simulated brain phantom for dynamic dual-tracer [18F]FDG+[11C]MET activity image separation and parametric map estimation. The results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the conventional voxel-wise multi-tracer compartmental modeling method (vMTCM) and the two-step method DIP-Dn+vMTCM (where dynamic dual-tracer activity images are first denoised using a U-net within the DIP framework, followed by vMTCM separation) in terms of lower bias and standard deviation in the separated single-tracer images and also for the estimated parametric maps for each tracer, at both voxel and ROI levels.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39774095/
Quantification of beta-adrenoceptor density in the human heart with (S)-[11C]CGP 12388 and a tracer kinetic model,"Petra Doze, Philip H Elsinga, Aren van Waarde, Remge M Pieterman, Jan Pruim, Willem Vaalburg, Antoon T M Willemsen","The aim of this study was to determine whether the beta-adrenoceptor receptor density (Bmax) and the ligand affinity (KD) of (S)-[11C]CGP 12388 for the beta-adrenoceptor receptor could be determined using full tracer kinetic modelling of the transport of the ligand and its interaction with the receptor. This approach minimises the a priori assumptions and may thus serve as a gold standard to validate other simplified methods. Dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) data were acquired in six healthy subjects during 60 min. Three different injection protocols were applied, each consisting of three injections with varying SAs: high specific activity (SA), low SA or unlabelled ligand only. Arterial blood samples were collected via a cannula in the radial artery. Time-activity data in myocardial tissue were obtained using regions of interest (ROIs) on short-axis planes. All data were analysed with a two-tissue compartment, six-parameter (K1, k2, k(on), k(off), Bmax, F(bv)) model that relies on explicit compartments for describing the kinetics of both labelled and unlabelled radioligand. Time-activity curves showed that unlabelled ligand could displace the radioligand from the receptor. This resulted in increased radioactivity levels in plasma. Modelling results yielded Bmax values of 9.74+/-1.80 nM and a KD of 0.58+/-0.22 nM, assuming a reaction volume of 0.15. In addition, parametric polar images of Bmax could be calculated. The protocol with injections of high SA, low SA, and unlabelled ligand, respectively, was found to be the most sensitive to parameter changes. We conclude that with tracer kinetic modelling of (S)-[11C]CGP 12388, the beta-adrenoceptor density in the human heart can accurately be obtained in vivo. This approach may thus serve as a gold standard.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12002702/
Decreased in vivo availability of the cannabinoid type 2 receptor in Alzheimer's disease,"Rawaha Ahmad, Andrey Postnov, Guy Bormans, Jan Versijpt, Mathieu Vandenbulcke, Koen Van Laere","Purpose: The cannabinoid type 2 receptor (CB2R) is expressed by immune cells such as monocytes and macrophages. In the brain, CB2R is primarily found on microglia. CB2R upregulation has been reported in animal models of Alzheimer's disease, with a preferential localization near amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques, and in patients post mortem. We performed in vivo brain imaging and kinetic modelling of the CB2R tracer [11C]NE40 in healthy controls (HC) and in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) to investigate whether higher CB2R availability regionally colocalized to Aβ deposits is present in vivo.

Methods: Dynamic 90-min [11C]NE40 PET scans were performed in eight HC and nine AD patients with full kinetic modelling using arterial sampling and metabolite correction and partial volume correction. All AD patients received a static [11C]PIB scan 40 min after injection. In four HC, a retest scan with [11C]NE40 PET was performed within 9 weeks to investigate test-retest characteristics.

Results: [11C]NE40 was metabolized quickly leading to 50 % of intact tracer 20 min after injection and 20 % at 90 min. A two-tissue kinetic model fitted most of the time-activity curves best; both binding potential (BPND) and distribution volume (VT) parameters could be used. Brain uptake was generally low with an average K1value of 0.07 ml/min/ml tissue. VTand BPNDwere in the range of 0.7 - 1.8 and 0.6 - 1.6, respectively. Test values in HC were about 30 % for VTand BPND. AD patients showed overall significantly lower CB2R binding. No relationship was found between regional or global amyloid load and CB2R availability.

Conclusion: Kinetic modelling of [11C]NE40 is possible with a two-tissue reversible model. In contrast to preclinical and post-mortem data, [11C]NE40 PET shows lower CB2R availability in vivo in AD patients, with no relationship to Aβ plaques. A possible explanation for these findings is that [11C]NE40 binds to CB2R with lower affinity and/or selectivity than to CB1R.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27488857/
Automatic TAC extraction from dynamic cardiac PET imaging using iterative correlation from a population template,"José M Mateos-Pérez, Manuel Desco, Michael W Dae, Carmen García-Villalba, Lorena Cussó, Juan J Vaquero","This work describes a new iterative method for extracting time-activity curves (TAC) from dynamic imaging studies using a priori information from generic models obtained from TAC templates. Analytical expressions of the TAC templates were derived from TACs obtained by manual segmentation of three (13)NH3 pig studies (gold standard). An iterative method for extracting both ventricular and myocardial TACs using models of the curves obtained as an initial template was then implemented and tested. These TACs were extracted from masked and unmasked images; masking was applied to remove the lungs and surrounding non-relevant structures. The resulting TACs were then compared with TACs obtained manually; the results of kinetic analysis were also compared. Extraction of TACs for each region was sensitive to the presence of other organs (e.g., lungs) in the image. Masking the volume of interest noticeably reduces error. The proposed method yields good results in terms of TAC definition and kinetic parameter estimation, even when the initial TAC templates do not accurately match specific tracer kinetics.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23693137/
Positron emission tomography of copper metabolism in the Atp7b-/- knock-out mouse model of Wilson's disease,"Fangyu Peng, Svetlana Lutsenko, Xiankai Sun, Otto Muzik","Purpose: This study aims to determine feasibility and utility of copper-64(II) chloride (⁶⁴CuCl₂) as a tracer for positron emission tomography (PET) of copper metabolism imbalance in human Wilson's disease (WD).

Procedures: Atp7b⁻/⁻ mice, a mouse model of human WD, were injected with ⁶⁴CuCl₂ intravenously and subjected to PET scanning using a hybrid PET-CT (computerized tomography) scanner, with the wild-type C57BL mice as a normal control. Quantitative PET analysis was performed to determine biodistribution of ⁶⁴Cu radioactivity and radiation dosimetry estimates of ⁶⁴Cu were calculated for PET of copper metabolism in humans.

Results: Dynamic PET analysis revealed increased accumulation and markedly reduced clearance of ⁶⁴Cu from the liver of the Atp7b⁻/⁻ mice, compared to hepatic uptake and clearance of ⁶⁴Cu in the wild-type C57BL mice. Kinetics of copper clearance and retention was also altered for kidneys, heart, and lungs in the Atp7b/⁻ mice. Based on biodistribution of ⁶⁴Cu in wild-type C57BL mice, radiation dosimetry estimates of ⁶⁴Cu in normal human subjects were obtained, showing an effective dose (ED) of 32.2 μ (micro)Sv/MBq (weighted dose over 22 organs) and the small intestine as the critical organ for radiation dose (61 μGy/MBq for males and 69 μGy/MBq for females). Radiation dosimetry estimates for the patients with WD, based on biodistribution of ⁶⁴Cu in the Atp7b⁻/⁻ mice, showed a similar ED of 32.8 μ (micro)Sv/MBq (p = 0.53), with the liver as the critical organ for radiation dose (120 μSv/MBq for male and 161 μSv/MBq for female).

Conclusions: Quantitative PET analysis demonstrates abnormal copper metabolism in the mouse model of WD with improved time-resolution. Human radiation dosimetry estimates obtained in this preclinical study encourage direct radiation dosimetry of ⁶⁴CuCl₂ in human subjects. The results suggest feasibility of utilizing ⁶⁴CuCl₂ as a tracer for noninvasive assessment of copper metabolism in WD with PET.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21327972/
Amino acids for the measurement of protein synthesis in vivo by PET,"W Vaalburg, H H Coenen, C Crouzel, P H Elsinga, B Långström, C Lemaire, G J Meyer","In principle, PET in combination with amino acids labelled with positron-emitting radionuclides and kinetic metabolic models, can quantify local protein synthesis rates in tissue in vivo. These PET measurements have clinical potential in, for example, oncology, neurology and psychiatry. An optimal positron-emitting amino acid for the measurement of PSR has a high protein incorporation, can easily be prepared by automated equipment and has minimal non-protein radioactive metabolites. Presently L-[methyl-11C]methionine, L-[1-11C]leucine, L-[1-11C]tyrosine, L-[1-11C]phenylalanine, L-[1-11C]methionine and L-[2-18F]fluorotyrosine are under evaluation in normal volunteers and/or in patients. Several other amino acids are suggested. No comparison of the clinical usefulness of the different amino acids in man is yet available. Because of the longer half life of 18F compared to 11C, [18F]fluoro amino acids may have advantages over [11C]amino acids for the investigation of tissue with relative slow protein synthesis, such as brain, and for application in institutions with an off site, but nearby cyclotron. The half life of [13N]amino acids is considered to be too short for flexible clinical application. As yet no metabolic compartmental model has been investigated for [13N]amino acids. For routine application reliable preparation of the radiopharmaceutical is essential. Of all the amino acids under evaluation, a reliable, high yield, easy to automate production procedure is available for L-[methyl-11C]methionine only. It is however unlikely that this tracer can accurately measure PSR because of its non-protein metabolism. For the other amino acids the main problems in production are associated with complex multistep syntheses and/or low radiochemical yields, complex purification methods and the need to isolate the L-enantiomer. The kinetic metabolic models under investigation, consist of 4 or 5 compartments depending on the necessity to compensate for labelled metabolites. The metabolic profile of the amino acids is mainly extracted from animal experiments. Because of the number and amount of labelled metabolites in plasma, [11C]carboxylic labelled amino acids are preferred to amino acids with carbon-11 in another position. As yet no recommendation can be given on the optimal labelled amino acid(s) for PSR measurement in vivo nor on the methods to prepare the amino acids reported for this purpose.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1601675/
Serotonin transporter binding after recovery from eating disorders,"Ursula F Bailer, Guido K Frank, Shannan E Henry, Julie C Price, Carolyn C Meltzer, Carl Becker, Scott K Ziolko, Chester A Mathis, Angela Wagner, Nicole C Barbarich-Marsteller, Karen Putnam, Walter H Kaye","Rationale: Several lines of evidence suggest that altered serotonin (5-HT) function persists after recovery from anorexia nervosa (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN).

Objectives: We compared 11 subjects who recovered (>1 year normal weight, regular menstrual cycles, no binging or purging) from restricting-type AN (REC RAN), 7 who recovered from bulimia-type AN (REC BAN), 9 who recovered from BN (REC BN), and 10 healthy control women (CW).

Materials and methods: Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with [11C]McN5652 was used to assess the 5-HT transporter (5-HTT). For [11C]McN5652, distribution volume (DV) values were determined using a two-compartment, three-parameter tracer kinetic model, and specific binding was assessed using the binding potential (BP, BP=DVregion of interest/DVcerebellum-1).

Results: After correction for multiple comparisons, the four groups showed significant (p<0.05) differences for [11C]McN5652 BP values for the dorsal raphe and antero-ventral striatum (AVS). Post-hoc analysis revealed that REC RAN had significantly increased [11C]McN5652 BP compared to REC BAN in these regions.

Conclusions: Divergent 5-HTT activity in subtypes of eating disorder subjects may provide important insights as to why these groups have differences in affective regulation and impulse control.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17690869/
Whiskers area as extracerebral reference tissue for quantification of rat brain metabolism using (18)F-FDG PET: application to focal cerebral ischemia,"Heiko Backes, Maureen Walberer, Heike Endepols, Bernd Neumaier, Rudolf Graf, Klaus Wienhard, Günter Mies","Diseases and dysfunction of the central nervous system are often associated with regional changes in cerebral glucose metabolism, which can be measured in vivo by PET using (18)F-FDG as the tracer. For quantification, the arterial tracer input function must be determined. For rodents in particular, direct measurement of blood radioactivity concentration is scarcely feasible for follow-up of individual animals because of the invasiveness of blood sampling. We show that the whiskers area of the rat's muzzle serves as an extracerebral reference region. The derived model also takes into account local variations of the lumped constant, which is crucial in pathologic tissue.

Methods: In 11 rats, the reference tissue kinetic parameters were determined from PET data and measured whole blood radioactivity concentration. Parametric images of cerebral kinetic rate constants were calculated using the directly measured input function, the reference tissue time-activity curve with individually fitted reference kinetic parameters, and the reference time-activity curve with fixed reference kinetic parameters calculated from the fitted parameters averaged over all animals. The need for kinetic modeling in disease models is demonstrated in 5 rats subjected to acute focal cerebral ischemia. (18)F-FDG metabolism and transport rate constants and local cerebral glucose metabolic rates were calculated.

Results: Cerebral kinetic constants derived from the 3 methods corresponded closely. The maximum difference in whole-brain kinetic parameters observed between the directly measured input function and the reference tissue time-activity curve with individually fitted reference kinetic parameters was less than 5%. Taking fixed reference parameters (the reference time-activity curve with fixed reference kinetic parameters calculated from the fitted parameters averaged over all animals) still provided whole-brain kinetic parameters with an accuracy of approximately 90%. In the rats subjected to focal cerebral ischemia, (18)F-FDG kinetic parameters in healthy tissue were not significantly different from whole-brain kinetic parameters in naive rats. The ischemic region was characterized by preserved glucose metabolism, although (18)F-FDG uptake was elevated significantly-that is, the lumped constant in the ischemic region was different from that of healthy brain tissue.

Conclusion: The method presented here allows for the quantitative noninvasive determination of cerebral glucose consumption in rats, takes into account local variations of the lumped constant, and is suitable for follow-up measurements of individuals.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21764786/
SAKE: a new quantification tool for positron emission tomography studies,"Mattia Veronese, Gaia Rizzo, Federico E Turkheimer, Alessandra Bertoldo","In dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) studies, spectral analysis (SA) refers to a data-driven quantification method, based on a single-input single-output model for which the transfer function is described by a sum of exponential terms. SA allows to quantify numerosities, amplitudes and eigenvalues of the transfer function allowing, in this way, to separate kinetic components of the tissue tracer activity with minimal model assumptions. The SA model can be solved with a linear estimator alone or with numerical filters, resulting in different types of SA approaches. Once estimated the number, amplitudes and eigenvalues of the transfer function, one can distinguish the presence in the system of irreversible and/or reversible components as well as derive parameters of physiological significance. These characteristics make it an appealing alternative method to compartmental models which are widely used for the quantitative analysis of dynamic studies acquired with PET. However, despite its applicability to a large number of PET tracers, its implementation is not straightforward and its utilization in the nuclear medicine community has been limited especially by the lack of an user-friendly software application. In this paper we proposed SAKE, a computer program for the quantitative analysis of PET data through the main SA methods. SAKE offers a unified pipeline of analysis usable also by people with limited computer knowledge but with high interest in SA.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23611334/
A method to estimate dispersion in sampling catheters and to calculate dispersion-free blood time-activity curves,"Ole Lajord Munk, Susanne Keiding, Ludvik Bass","The authors developed a transmission-dispersion model to estimate dispersion in blood sampling systems and to calculate dispersion-free input functions needed for kinetic analysis. Transport of molecules through catheters was considered in two parts: a central part with convective transmission of molecules and a stagnant layer that molecules may enter and leave. The authors measured dispersion caused by automatic and manual blood sampling using three PET tracers that distribute differently in blood (C15O, H2(15)O, and 11C-methylglucose). For manual sampling, dispersion was negligible. For the automated sampling procedure, characteristic parameters were calibrated for each tracer, and subsequently used in calculating dispersion-free input functions following real bolus injections. This led to shapes of dispersion-free input functions C(i)(t) that had sharper peaks than the measured C(o)(t), and the authors quantified the effect of correcting for dispersion before kinetic modeling. The transmission-dispersion model quantitatively takes apart effects of transmission and dispersion, it has transparent noise properties associated with each component, and it does not require deconvolution to calculate dispersion-free input functions. Once characteristic parameters are estimated, input functions can be corrected before applying kinetic models. This allows bias-free estimation of kinetic parameters such as blood flow.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18777907/
A new method measuring the interaction of radiotracers with the human P-glycoprotein (P-gp) transporter,"Chrysoula Vraka, Monika Dumanic, Teresa Racz, Florian Pichler, Cecile Philippe, Theresa Balber, Eva-Maria Klebermass, Karl-Heinz Wagner, Marcus Hacker, Wolfgang Wadsak, Markus Mitterhauser","In drug development, biomarkers for cerebral applications have a lower success rate compared to cardiovascular drugs or tumor therapeutics. One reason is the missing blood brain barrier penetration, caused by the tracer's interaction with efflux transporters such as the P-gp (MDR1 or ABCB1). Aim of this study was the development of a reliable model to measure the interaction of radiotracers with the human efflux transporter P-gp in parallel to the radiolabeling process. LigandTracer® Technology was used with the wildtype cell line MDCKII and the equivalent cell line overexpressing human P-gp (MDCKII-hMDR1). The method was evaluated based on established PET tracers with known interaction with the human P-gp transporter and in nanomolar concentration (15 nM). [11C]SNAP-7941 and [18F]FE@SNAP were used as P-gp substrates by comparing the real-time model with an uptake assay and μPET images. [11C]DASB [11C]Harmine, [18F]FMeNER,[18F]FE@SUPPY and [11C]Me@HAPTHI were used as tracers without interactions with P-gp in vitro. However, [11C]Me@HAPTHI shows a significant increase in SUV levels after blocking with Tariquidar. The developed real-time kinetic model uses directly PET tracers in a compound concentration, which is reflecting the in vivo situation.

[Positron emission tomography in cardiological diagnosis: principles and clinical application],"J vom Dahl, M Schwaiger","Positron emission tomography (PET) is an emerging new cardiac imaging modality which allows sophisticated tissue characterization using radiopharmaceuticals. This technique provides absolute quantification of regional tracer concentration using short-lived isotopes such as carbon-11, oxygen-15 and nitrogen-13, which can be easily incorporated in many compounds without changing their biological behaviour. These technical advantages are somewhat offset by the high cost of this technology which includes camera as well as on site cyclotron required for the preparation of radiopharmaceuticals. Recent clinical dates suggest that unique information can be obtained with PET. Using blood flow tracers in combination with PET, coronary artery disease can be detected and localized with high diagnostic accuracy. First studies comparing Tl-201 SPECT and PET in the same patient population indicate diagnostic superiority of PET. In combination with tracer kinetic models, regional myocardial blood flow can be quantitated and the functional significance of coronary artery stenosis defined by regional coronary reserve measurements. The assessment of regional glucose metabolism by PET with the tracer F-18 deoxyglucose has received wide clinical acceptance. Metabolic imaging in patients with advanced coronary artery disease allows the delineation of ischemically compromised but viable myocardium. Selection of patients for revascularization based on this scintigraphy tissue characterization has been shown to have a high predictive value for subsequent tissue recovery. Comparison of PET/FDG imaging with thallium-201 scintigraphy for assessment of tissue viability indicate that, in patients with fixed thallium-201 defects, additional diagnostic information can be obtained by this more expensive technology.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1411018/
"Quantitation of [11C]diprenorphine cerebral kinetics in man acquired by PET using presaturation, pulse-chase and tracer-only protocols","A K Jones, V J Cunningham, S K Ha-Kawa, T Fujiwara, Q Liyii, S K Luthra, J Ashburner, S Osman, T Jones","The quantitation of regional cerebral in vivo opioid receptor rate constants using [11C]diprenorphine and positron emission tomography (PET) using 3 types of protocol (presaturation, pulse-chase naloxone displacement and tracer-only protocols) together with measurements of regional cerebral blood flow is described in normal volunteers. Arterial blood was sampled continuously for radioactivity and was corrected for metabolites and plasma/blood partition of radioactivity to provide a continuous plasma input function. A compartmental model involving 3 tissue compartments was used to describe the regional cerebral pharmacokinetics of the tracer. The compartments comprised: (1) free plus rapidly exchanging non-specifically bound ligand, (2) specifically bound, naloxone displaceable ligand, and (3) a kinetically distinguishable non-specifically bound pool. Regional estimates of fractional rate constants relating to specific binding were obtained using naloxone in a pulse-chase design of tracer displacement. Less precise estimates of these rate constraints were obtained from single-tracer-only studies, but when binding was expressed as the tissue total volume of distribution relative to plasma there was good correlation with regional values obtained from pulse-chase studies performed in the same individuals. The application of these protocols to the measurement of indices of regional-specific opioid receptor binding in the human brain is discussed.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8051944/
Present and future capabilities of molecular imaging techniques to understand brain function,T Jones,"This article focuses on the use of positron emitting tracers and positron emission tomography (PET) as the most specific and sensitive means for imaging molecular interactions and pathways within the human brain. The concept of the imaging science of PET is developed whereby the key components that contribute to the overall accuracy of the image of molecular activity need to be separately optimized. These include radiolabelling of tracer molecules and ligands with radioisotopes of short radioactive half-life, the search for specific radioligands and tracers, and hence the need to mine molecular databases for molecules suitable for in-vivo imaging. The sensitivity and accuracy of PET scanners need to be advanced along with improvements in the signal-to-noise ratio of the tomographic reconstruction algorithms. Finally, the models used for the analysis of serial time frames of kinetic data need to be developed, the operation of which have to be effected with the minimum of noise propagation. The future use of PET for drug discovery and development is discussed whereby it offers proof principle for assays of in-vivo expression of therapeutic molecular targets as accessed from the blood stream; tissue pharmacokinetics of novel compounds; degree of occupancy of molecular targets; and pharmacodynamic measures of drug action. The future application of PET rests heavily on drug discoverers contributing to discovering specific PET radioligands and tracers in order to provide these assays through in-vivo molecular imaging.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10667607/
A three-time-point method for assessing kinetic parameters of 64Cu-labeled Ramucirumab trapping in VEGFR-2 positive lung tumors,"Eric Laffon, Roger Marthan","Objective: To describe a three-time-point method for estimating kinetic parameters involved in64Cu-labeled Ramucirumab (64Cu-NOTA-RamAb) trapping of VEGFR-2 positive lung tumors.

Materials and methods: Positron emission tomography (microPET) data of tumor-bearing mice for64Cu-NOTA-RamAb trapping in VEGFR-2 positive HCC4006 tumor were used, involving tissue activity measurements acquired at 3, 24 and 48 h post-injection, without and with administration of RamAb blocking dose. A kinetic model provided an analytical formula describing the tissue time-activity-curve, involving64Cu-NOTA-RamAb uptake (Ki), release rate constant (kR) and fraction of free tracer in blood and interstitial volume (F).

Results: Fitting analytical formula outcomes on mean microPET data yielded values of the kinetic parameters: Ki = 0.0314/0.0123 gram of blood per hour per gram of tissue, kR= 0.0387/0.0313 h-1and F = 0.2075/0.2007 gram of blood per gram of tissue, without/with RamAb blocking dose, respectively (R = 0.99999 for the graph displaying microPET versus theoretical data; P < .01).

Conclusions: Three independent kinetic parameters (Ki, kRand F) can be assessed from three data points acquired at early, mid and late imaging, i.e., at 3, 24 and 48 h post-injection, for further characterization of64Cu-NOTA-RamAb trapping in VEGFR-2 positive lung tumors.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29195550/
"Striatal dopamine transporter and receptor availability correlate with relative cerebral blood flow measured with [11C]PE2I, [18F]FE-PE2I and [11C]raclopride PET in healthy individuals","My Jonasson, Andreas Frick, Patrik Fazio, Olof Hjorth, Torsten Danfors, Jan Axelsson, Lieuwe Appel, Tomas Furmark, Andrea Varrone, Mark Lubberink","The aim of this retrospective study was to investigate relationships between relative cerebral blood flow and striatal dopamine transporter and dopamine D2/3 availability in healthy subjects. The data comprised dynamic PET scans with two dopamine transporter tracers [11C]PE2I (n = 20) and [18F]FE-PE2I (n = 20) and the D2/3 tracer [11C]raclopride (n = 18). Subjects with a [11C]PE2I scan also underwent a dynamic scan with the serotonin transporter tracer [11C]DASB. Binding potential (BPND) and relative tracer delivery (R1) values were calculated on regional and voxel-level. Striatal R1and BPNDvalues were correlated, using either an MRI-based volume of interest (VOI) or an isocontour VOI based on the parametric BPNDimage. An inter-tracer comparison between [11C]PE2I BPNDand [11C]DASB R1was done on a VOI-level and simulations were performed to investigate whether the constraints of the modeling could cause correlation of the parameters. A positive association was found between BPNDand R1for all three dopamine tracers. A similar correlation was found for the inter-tracer correlation between [11C]PE2I BPNDand [11C]DASB R1. Simulations showed that this relationship was not caused by cross-correlation between parameters in the kinetic model. In conclusion, these results suggest an association between resting-state striatal dopamine function and relative blood flow in healthy subjects.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36912083/
Suitability of [18F]altanserin and PET to determine 5-HT2A receptor availability in the rat brain: in vivo and in vitro validation of invasive and non-invasive kinetic models,"Tina Kroll, David Elmenhorst, Andreas Matusch, Franziska Wedekind, Angela Weisshaupt, Simone Beer, Andreas Bauer","Purpose: While the selective 5-hydroxytryptamine type 2a receptor (5-HT2AR) radiotracer [18F]altanserin is well established in humans, the present study evaluated its suitability for quantifying cerebral 5-HT2ARs with positron emission tomography (PET) in albino rats.

Procedures: Ten Sprague Dawley rats underwent 180 min PET scans with arterial blood sampling. Reference tissue methods were evaluated on the basis of invasive kinetic models with metabolite-corrected arterial input functions. In vivo 5-HT2AR quantification with PET was validated by in vitro autoradiographic saturation experiments in the same animals.

Result: Overall brain uptake of [18F]altanserin was reliably quantified by invasive and non-invasive models with the cerebellum as reference region shown by linear correlation of outcome parameters. Unlike in humans, no lipophilic metabolites occurred so that brain activity derived solely from parent compound. PET data correlated very well with in vitro autoradiographic data of the same animals.

Conclusion: [18F]Altanserin PET is a reliable tool for in vivo quantification of 5-HT2AR availability in albino rats. Models based on both blood input and reference tissue describe radiotracer kinetics adequately. Low cerebral tracer uptake might, however, cause restrictions in experimental usage.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23456885/
18F-fluoro-L-thymidine and 11C-methylmethionine as markers of increased transport and proliferation in brain tumors,"Andreas H Jacobs, Anne Thomas, Lutz W Kracht, Huongfeng Li, Claus Dittmar, Guido Garlip, Norbert Galldiks, Johannes C Klein, Jan Sobesky, Rüdiger Hilker, Stefan Vollmar, Karl Herholz, Klaus Wienhard, Wolf-Dieter Heiss","Because of the high glucose metabolism in normal brain tissue 18F-FDG is not the ideal tracer for the detection of gliomas. Methyl-11C-l-methionine (11C-MET) is better suited for imaging the extent of gliomas, because it is transported specifically into tumors but only insignificantly into normal brain. 3'-Deoxy-3'-18F-fluorothymidine (18F-FLT) has been introduced as a proliferation marker in a variety of neoplasias and has promising potential for the detection of brain tumors, because its uptake in normal brain is low. Additionally, the longer half-life might permit differentiation between transport and intracellular phosphorylation.

Methods: PET of 18F-FLT and 11C-MET was performed on 23 patients (age range, 20-70 y) with histologically verified gliomas of different grades. On all patients, conventional MRI was performed, and 16 patients additionally underwent contrast-enhanced imaging. Images were coregistered, and the volumes of abnormality were defined for PET and MRI. Uptake ratios and standardized uptake values (SUVs) of various tumors and regions were assessed by region-of-interest analysis. Kinetic modeling was performed on 14 patients for regional time-activity curves of 18F-FLT from tumorous and normal brain tissue.

Results: Sensitivity for the detection of tumors was lower for 18F-FLT than for 11C-MET (78.3% vs. 91.3%), especially for low-grade astrocytomas. Tumor volumes detected by 18F-FLT and 11C-MET were larger than tumor regions displaying gadolinium enhancement (P<0.01). Uptake ratios of 18F-FLT were higher than uptake ratios of 11C-MET (P<0.01). Uptake ratios of 18F-FLT were higher in glioblastomas than in astrocytomas (P<0.01). Absolute radiotracer uptake of 18F-FLT was low and significantly lower than that of 11C-MET (SUV, 1.3+/-0.7 vs. 3.1+/-1.0; P<0.01). Some tumor regions were detected only by either 18F-FLT (7 patients) or 11C-MET (13 patients). Kinetic modeling revealed that 18F-FLT uptake in tumor tissue seems to be predominantly due to elevated transport and net influx. However, a moderate correlation was found between uptake ratio and phosphorylation rate k3 (r=0.65 and P=0.01 for grade II-IV gliomas; r=0.76 and P<0.01 for grade III-IV tumors).

Conclusion: 18F-FLT is a promising tracer for the detection and characterization of primary central nervous system tumors and might help to differentiate between low- and high-grade gliomas. 18F-FLT uptake is mainly due to increased transport, but irreversible incorporation by phosphorylation might also contribute. In some tumors and tumor areas, 18F-FLT uptake is not related to 11C-MET uptake. In view of the high sensitivity and specificity of 11C-MET PET for imaging of gliomas, it cannot be excluded that 18F-FLT PET was false positive in these areas. However, the discrepancies observed for the various imaging modalities (18F-FLT and 11C-MET PET as well as gadolinium-enhanced MRI) yield complementary information on the activity and the extent of gliomas and might improve early evaluation of treatment effects, especially in patients with high-grade gliomas. Further studies are needed, including coregistered histology and kinetic analysis in patients undergoing chemotherapy.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16330557/
Synthesis and evaluation of 18F-FE-PEO in rodents: an 18F-labeled full agonist for opioid receptor imaging,"Patrick J Riss, Young T Hong, János Marton, Daniele Caprioli, David J Williamson, Valentina Ferrari, Neil Saigal, Bryan L Roth, Gjermund Henriksen, Tim D Fryer, Jeffrey W Dalley, Franklin I Aigbirhio","We have investigated the opioid receptor (OR) agonist (20R)-4,5-α-epoxy-6-(2-(18)F-fluoroethoxy)-3-hydroxy-α,17-dimethyl-α-(2-phenyleth-1-yl)-6,14-ethenomorphinan-7-methanol ((18)F-FE-PEO) as a candidate OR PET ligand. This tracer is attractive because it combines (18)F labeling, is suited to the slow kinetics of high-affinity ligands, and has agonist binding, which has been shown to be more sensitive to changes in OR occupation than is antagonist binding.

Methods: Agonist potency and off-target binding were investigated in vitro, and autoradiographic studies on rat brain sections were used to assess binding patterns. Quantification of the tracer in vivo was investigated using small-animal PET in rats with blood sampling.

Results: (18)F-FE-PEO was obtained by direct nucleophilic radiofluorination and subsequent deprotection with a yield of 28% ± 15%, a specific activity of 52-224 MBq/nmol, and a radiochemical purity of more than 97% (90 min from end of bombardment). In vitro studies showed it to be a full agonist ligand, which selectively binds to OR with high affinity, although it is not selective to a single OR subtype (inhibition constant, 0.4-1.6 nM across OR subtypes). Autoradiography binding patterns were consistent with the known distribution of OR, although nondisplaceable signal typically constituted one third of the signal in OR-dense regions. Although metabolites were present in blood (∼40% of plasma radioactivity was nonparent 3 h after injection), no significant metabolite fraction was found in brain tissue, aiding PET quantification. A plasma input 2-tissue-compartment model provided good fits to the PET data, and regional distribution volumes from the latter correlated well with those from Logan plot analysis (r(2) = 0.98). The cerebellum had the lowest distribution volume, but the time-activity curve data could not be adequately fitted with a 1-tissue-compartment model. Reference tissue models using the cerebellum as the reference region did not provide good fits to the data, so blood-based kinetic analysis is recommended.

Conclusion: As the first (18)F-labeled OR agonist ligand, (18)F-FE-PEO is a useful addition to the existing OR ligand portfolio.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23297076/
Pharmacokinetic analysis of [18F]FAZA in non-small cell lung cancer patients,"Eline E Verwer, Floris H P van Velden, Idris Bahce, Maqsood Yaqub, Robert C Schuit, Albert D Windhorst, Pieter Raijmakers, Adriaan A Lammertsma, Egbert F Smit, Ronald Boellaard","Purpose: [(18)F]Fluoroazomycin arabinoside (FAZA) is a positron emission tomography (PET) tracer developed to enable identification of hypoxic regions within a tumour. The aims of this study were to determine the optimal kinetic model along with validation of using alternatives to arterial blood sampling for analysing [(18)F]FAZA studies and to assess the validity of simplified analytical methods.

Methods: Dynamic 70-min [(18)F]FAZA PET/CT scans were obtained from nine non-small cell lung cancer patients. Continuous arterial blood sampling, together with manual arterial and venous sampling, was performed to derive metabolite-corrected plasma input functions. Volumes of interest (VOIs) were defined for tumour, healthy lung muscle and adipose tissue generating [(18)F]FAZA time-activity curves (TACs). TACs were analysed using one- and two-tissue compartment models using both metabolite-corrected blood sampler plasma input functions (BSIF) and image-derived plasma input functions (IDIF).

Results: The reversible two-tissue compartment model with blood volume parameter (2T4k+VB) best described kinetics of [(18)F]FAZA in tumours. Volumes of distribution (VT) obtained using IDIF correlated well with those derived using BSIF (R(2) = 0.82). Venous samples yielded the same radioactivity concentrations as arterial samples for times >50 min post-injection (p.i.). In addition, both plasma to whole blood ratios and parent fractions were essentially the same for venous and arterial samples. Both standardised uptake value (SUV), normalised to lean body mass, and tumour to blood ratio correlated well with VT (R(2) = 0.77 and R(2) = 0.87, respectively, at 50-60 min p.i.), although a bias was observed at low VT.

Conclusion: The 2T4k+VB model provided the best fit to the dynamic [(18)F]FAZA data. IDIF with venous blood samples can be used as input function. Further data are needed to validate the use of simplified methods.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23740374/
In Vivo Synaptic Density Imaging with 11C-UCB-J Detects Treatment Effects of Saracatinib in a Mouse Model of Alzheimer Disease,"Takuya Toyonaga, Levi M Smith, Sjoerd J Finnema, Jean-Dominique Gallezot, Mika Naganawa, Jason Bini, Tim Mulnix, Zhengxin Cai, Jim Ropchan, Yiyun Huang, Stephen M Strittmatter, Richard E Carson","11C-UCB-J is a new PET tracer for synaptic density imaging. Recently, we conducted11C-UCB-J PET on patients with mild cognitive impairment or early Alzheimer disease (AD) and found a 41% decrease in specific binding in the hippocampus compared with healthy subjects. We hypothesized that11C-UCB-J may have potential to be a general biomarker for evaluating AD treatment effects via monitoring of synaptic density changes. In this study, we performed longitudinal11C-UCB-J PET on AD mice to measure the treatment effects of saracatinib, which previously demonstrated synaptic changes with postmortem methods.Methods:Nine wild-type (WT) mice and 9 amyloid precursor protein and presenilin 1 double-transgenic (APPswe/PS1ΔE9 [APP/PS1]) mice underwent 311C-UCB-J PET measurements: at baseline, after treatment, and during drug washout. After baseline measurements, saracatinib, a Fyn kinase inhibitor currently in clinical development for AD treatment, was administered by oral gavage for 41 ± 11 d. Treatment-phase measurements were performed on the last day of treatment, and washout-phase measurements occurred more than 27 d after the end of treatment. SUVs from 30 to 60 min after injection of11C-UCB-J were calculated and normalized by the whole-brain (WB) or brain stem (BS) average values as SUV ratio (SUVR(WB)or SUVR-1(BS)).Results:Hippocampal SUVR(WB)at baseline was significantly lower in APP/PS1 than WT mice (APP/PS1: 1.11 ± 0.04, WT: 1.15 ± 0.02,P= 0.033, unpairedttest). Using SUVR-1(BS)in the hippocampus, there was also a significant difference at baseline (APP/PS1: 0.48 ± 0.13, WT: 0.65 ± 0.10,P= 0.017, unpairedttest). After treatment with saracatinib, hippocampal SUVR(WB)in APP/PS1 mice was significantly increased (P= 0.037, pairedttest). A trend-level treatment effect was seen with hippocampal SUVR-1(BS).Saracatinib treatment effects may persist, as there were no significant differences between WT and APP/PS1 mice after drug washout.Conclusion:On the basis of the11C-UCB-J PET results, hippocampal synaptic density was lower in APP/PS1 mice than in WT mice at baseline, and this deficit was normalized by treatment with saracatinib. These results support the use of11C-UCB-J PET to identify disease-specific synaptic deficits and to monitor treatment effects in AD.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31101744/
Functional Renal Imaging with 2-Deoxy-2-18F-Fluorosorbitol PET in Rat Models of Renal Disorders,"Rudolf A Werner, Hiroshi Wakabayashi, Xinyu Chen, Mitsuru Hirano, Tetsuya Shinaji, Constantin Lapa, Steven P Rowe, Mehrbod S Javadi, Takahiro Higuchi","Precise regional quantitative assessment of renal function is limited with conventional99mTc-labeled renal radiotracers. A recent study reported that the PET radiotracer 2-deoxy-2-18F-fluorosorbitol (18F-FDS) has ideal pharmacokinetics for functional renal imaging. Furthermore,18F-FDS is available via simple reduction from routinely used18F-FDG. We aimed to further investigate the potential of18F-FDS PET as a functional renal imaging agent using rat models of kidney disease.Methods:Two different rat models of renal impairment were investigated: induction of acute renal failure by intramuscular administration of glycerol in the hind legs, and induction of unilateral ureteral obstruction by ligation of the left ureter. At 24 h after these procedures, dynamic 30-min18F-FDS PET data were acquired using a dedicated small-animal PET system. Urine18F-FDS radioactivity 30 min after radiotracer injection was measured together with coinjected99mTc-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid urine activity.Results:Dynamic PET imaging demonstrated rapid18F-FDS accumulation in the renal cortex and rapid radiotracer excretion via the kidneys in healthy control rats. On the other hand, significantly delayed renal radiotracer uptake (continuous slow uptake) was observed in acute renal failure rats and unilateral ureteral obstruction kidneys. Measured urine radiotracer concentrations of18F-FDS and99mTc-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid correlated well with each other (R= 0.84,P< 0.05).Conclusion:18F-FDS PET demonstrated favorable kinetics for functional renal imaging in rat models of kidney diseases.18F-FDS PET imaging, with its advantages of high spatiotemporal resolution and simple tracer production, could potentially complement or replace conventional renal scintigraphy in select cases and significantly improve the diagnostic performance of renal functional imaging.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29242399/
Measurement of input functions in rodents: challenges and solutions,"Richard Laforest, Terry L Sharp, John A Engelbach, Nicole M Fettig, Pilar Herrero, Joonyoung Kim, Jason S Lewis, Douglas J Rowland, Yuan-Chuan Tai, Michael J Welch","Introduction: Tracer kinetic modeling used in conjunction with positron emission tomography (PET) is an excellent tool for the noninvasive quantification of physiological, biological and molecular processes and their alterations due to disease. Currently, complex multi-compartment modeling approaches are being applied in a variety of clinical studies to determine myocardial perfusion, viability and glucose utilization as well as fatty acid metabolism and oxidation in the normal and diseased heart. These kinetic models require two key measurements of tracer activity over time, tracer activity in arterial blood (input function) and its corresponding activity in the organ of interest. The alteration in the time course of tracer activity as it travels from blood to the organ of interest describes the kinetics of the tracer. To be able to implement these approaches in rodent models of disease using small-animal PET (microPET), it is imperative that the input function is measured accurately.

Methods: The blood input functions in rodent experiments were obtained by (1) direct blood sampling, (2) direct measurement of blood activity by a beta-detecting probe that counts the activity in the blood, (3) an arterial-venous bypass (A/V shunt), (4) factor analysis of dynamic structures from dynamic PET images and (5) measurement from region-of-interest (ROI) analysis of dynamic PET images. Direct blood sampling was used as the reference standard to which the results of the other techniques were compared.

Results: Beta probes are difficult to operate and may not provide accurate blood input functions unless they are used intravenously, which requires complicated microsurgery. A similar limitation applies to the A/V shunt. Factor analysis successfully extracts the blood input function for mice and rats. The ROI-based method is less accurate due to limited image resolution of the PET system, which results in severe partial volume effect and spillover from myocardium.

Conclusion: The current reference standard, direct blood sampling, is more invasive and has limited temporal resolution. With current imaging technology, image-based extraction of blood input functions is possible by factor analysis, while forthcoming technological developments are likely to allow extraction of input function directly from the images. These techniques will reduce the level of complexity and invasiveness for animal experiments and are likely to be used more widely in the future.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16243642/
Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and Pharmacokinetics: Classical Blood Sampling Versus Image-Derived Analysis of [18F]FAZA and [18F]FDG in a Murine Tumor Bearing Model,"Hans-Soenke Jans, Xiao-Hong Yang, Dion R Brocks, Piyush Kumar, Melinda Wuest, Leonard I Wiebe","Purpose: Pharmacokinetic (PK) data are generally derived from blood samples withdrawn serially over a defined period after dosing. In small animals, blood sampling after dosing presents technical difficulties, particularly when short time intervals and frequent sampling are required. Positron emission tomography (PET) is a non-invasive functional imaging technique that can provide semi-quantitative temporal data for defined volume regions of interest (vROI), to support kinetic analyses in blood and other tissues. The application of preclinical small-animal PET to determine and compare PK parameters for [18F]FDG and [18F]FAZA, radiopharmaceuticals used clinically for assessing glucose metabolism and hypoxic fractions, respectively, in the same mammary EMT6 tumor-bearing mouse model, is reported here.

Methods: Two study groups were used: normal BALB/c mice under isoflurane anesthesia were intravenously injected with either [18F]FDG or [18F]FAZA. For the first group, blood-sampling by tail artery puncture was used to collect blood samples which were then analyzed with Radio-microTLC. Dynamic PET experiments were performed with the second group of mice and analyzed for blood input function and tumor uptake utilizing a modified two compartment kinetic model. Heart and inferior vena cava vROIs were sampled to obtain image-derived data. PK parameters were calculated from blood samples and image-derived data. Time-activity curves (TACs) were also generated over regions of liver, kidney and urinary bladder to depict clearance profiles for each radiotracer.

Results: PK values generated by classical blood sampling and PET image-derived analysis were comparable to each other for both radiotracers. Heart vROI data were suitable for analysis of [18F]FAZA kinetics, but metabolic uptake of radioactivity mandated the use of inferior vena cava vROIs for [18F]FDG analysis. While clearance (CL) and blood half-life (t½) were similar for both [18F]FDG and [18F]FAZA for both sampling methods, volume of distribution yielded larger differences, indicative of limitations such as partial volume effects within quantitative image-derived data. [18F]FDG underwent faster blood clearance and had a shorter blood half-life than [18F]FAZA. Kinetic analysis of tumor uptake from PET image data showed higher uptake and longer tumor tissue retention of [18F]FDG, indicative of the tumor's glucose metabolism rate, versus lower tumor uptake and retention of [18F]FAZA. While [18F]FAZA possesses a somewhat greater hepatobiliary clearance , [18F]FDG clears faster through the renal system which results in faster radioactivity accumulation in the urinary bladder.

Conclusions: The present study provides a working example of the applicability of functional PET imaging as a suitable tool to determine PK parameters in small animals. The comparative analysis in the current study demonstrates that it is feasible to use [18F]FDG PET and [18F]FAZA PET in the same model to analyze their blood PK parameters, and to estimate kinetic parameters for these tracers in tumor. This non-invasive imaging-based determination of tissue kinetic parameters facilitates translation from pre-clinical to clinical phases of drug development.

Absolute quantification of [(11)C]docetaxel kinetics in lung cancer patients using positron emission tomography,"Astrid A M van der Veldt, Mark Lubberink, Henri N Greuter, Emile F I Comans, Gerarda J M Herder, Maqsood Yaqub, Robert C Schuit, Arthur van Lingen, S Nafees Rizvi, Martien P J Mooijer, Anneloes Y Rijnders, Albert D Windhorst, Egbert F Smit, N Harry Hendrikse, Adriaan A Lammertsma","Purpose: Tumor resistance to docetaxel may be associated with reduced drug concentrations in tumor tissue. Positron emission tomography (PET) allows for quantification of radiolabeled docetaxel ([(11)C]docetaxel) kinetics and might be useful for predicting response to therapy. The primary objective was to evaluate the feasibility of quantitative [(11)C]docetaxel PET scans in lung cancer patients. The secondary objective was to investigate whether [(11)C]docetaxel kinetics were associated with tumor perfusion, tumor size, and dexamethasone administration.

Experimental design: Thirty-four lung cancer patients underwent dynamic PET-computed tomography (CT) scans using [(11)C]docetaxel. Blood flow was measured using oxygen-15 labeled water. The first 24 patients were premedicated with dexamethasone. For quantification of [(11)C]docetaxel kinetics, the optimal tracer kinetic model was developed and a noninvasive procedure was validated.

Results: Reproducible quantification of [(11)C]docetaxel kinetics in tumors was possible using a noninvasive approach (image derived input function). Thirty-two lesions (size ≥4 cm(3)) were identified, having a variable net influx rate of [(11)C]docetaxel (range, 0.0023-0.0229 mL·cm(-3)·min(-1)). [(11)C]docetaxel uptake was highly related to tumor perfusion (Spearman's ρ = 0.815;P < 0.001), but not to tumor size (Spearman's ρ = -0.140; P = 0.446). Patients pretreated with dexamethasone showed lower [(11)C]docetaxel uptake in tumors (P = 0.013). Finally, in a subgroup of patients who subsequently received docetaxel therapy, relative high [(11)C]docetaxel uptake was related with improved tumor response.

Conclusions: Quantification of [(11)C]docetaxel kinetics in lung cancer was feasible in a clinical setting. Variable [(11)C]docetaxel kinetics in tumors may reflect differential sensitivity to docetaxel therapy. Our findings warrant further studies investigating the predictive value of [(11)C]docetaxel uptake and the effects of comedication on [(11)C]docetaxel kinetics in tumors.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21750197/
An Improved Antagonist Radiotracer for the κ-Opioid Receptor: Synthesis and Characterization of (11)C-LY2459989,"Ming-Qiang Zheng, Su Jin Kim, Daniel Holden, Shu-fei Lin, Anne Need, Karen Rash, Vanessa Barth, Charles Mitch, Antonio Navarro, Michael Kapinos, Kathleen Maloney, Jim Ropchan, Richard E Carson, Yiyun Huang","The κ-opioid receptors (KORs) are implicated in several neuropsychiatric diseases and addictive disorders. PET with radioligands provides a means to image the KOR in vivo and investigate its function in health and disease. The purpose of this study was to develop the selective KOR antagonist (11)C-LY2459989 as a PET radioligand and characterize its imaging performance in nonhuman primates.

Methods: LY2459989 was synthesized and assayed for in vitro binding to opioid receptors. Ex vivo studies in rodents were conducted to assess its potential as a tracer candidate. (11)C-LY2459989 was synthesized by reaction of its iodophenyl precursor with (11)C-cyanide, followed by partial hydrolysis of the resulting (11)C-cyanophenyl intermediate. Imaging experiments with (11)C-LY2459989 were performed in rhesus monkeys with arterial input function measurement. Imaging data were analyzed with kinetic models to derive in vivo binding parameters.

Results: LY2459989 is a full antagonist with high binding affinity and selectivity for KOR (0.18, 7.68, and 91.3 nM, respectively, for κ, μ, and δ receptors). Ex vivo studies in rats indicated LY2459989 as an appropriate tracer candidate with high specific binding signals and confirmed its KOR binding selectivity in vivo. (11)C-LY2459989 was synthesized in high radiochemical purity and good specific activity. In rhesus monkeys, (11)C-LY2459989 displayed a fast rate of peripheral metabolism. Similarly, (11)C-LY2459989 displayed fast uptake kinetics in the brain and an uptake pattern consistent with the distribution of KOR in primates. Pretreatment with naloxone (1 mg/kg, intravenously) resulted in a uniform distribution of radioactivity in the brain. Further, specific binding of (11)C-LY2459989 was dose-dependently reduced by the selective KOR antagonist LY2456302 and the unlabeled LY2459989. Regional binding potential values derived from the multilinear analysis-1 (MA1) method, as a measure of in vivo specific binding signal, were 2.18, 1.39, 1.08, 1.04, 1.03, 0.59, 0.51, and 0.50, respectively, for the globus pallidus, cingulate cortex, insula, caudate, putamen, frontal cortex, temporal cortex, and thalamus.

Conclusion: The novel PET radioligand (11)C-LY2459989 displayed favorable pharmacokinetic properties, a specific and KOR-selective binding profile, and high specific binding signals in vivo, thus making it a promising PET imaging agent for KOR.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24854795/
Quantification of Multi-Organ 11β-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase Type 1 Enzyme Levels in a Zucker Fatty Rat Model: A PET Imaging Study,"Jason Bini, Jordan Strober, Michael Kapinos, Ming-Qiang Zheng, Songye Li, Jim Ropchan, Nabeel Nabulsi, Yiyun Huang, Rachel J Perry, Daniel F Vatner, Richard E Carson","Background: In rodents, 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1 (11β-HSD1) catalyzes the conversion of inactive 11-dehydrocorticosterone to the active hormone corticosterone. Dysregulation of intracellular glucocorticoid action is implicated in metabolic diseases. Assessing 11β-HSD1 enzyme levelsin vivomay be key to understanding obesity pathophysiology.

Objective: We used a Zucker Fatty (ZF) rat model and [18F]AS2471907 PET imaging to determine appropriate kinetic modeling methods and assess changes in 11β-HSD1 levels due to obesity in the liver, white and brown adipose tissue (WAT/BAT), and brain.

Material and methods: To validate [18F]AS2471907 PET in preclinical models, time-activity curves (TACs) were generated and kinetic modeling was performed with image-derived input functions (IDIFs) extracted from multiple locations. Quantitative estimates of radioligand binding were compared withex vivo11β-HSD1 protein expression. Validated quantitative PET kinetic modeling methods were then used to assess differences in 11β-HSD1 between lean and obese ZF rats. Metabolic disease status was confirmed with stable isotopes tracer studies of glucose and fatty acid metabolism.

Results: Obesity is associated with decreased brain 11β-HSD1 levels, measured by [18F]AS2471907 PET, which correlated with measures of glucose and fatty acid metabolism.

Conclusion: We demonstrate that [18F]AS2471907 PET can provide useful quantification of 11β-HSD1 levels in a rodent model of obesity.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40270581/
"Kinetic Modelling of Infection Tracers [18F]FDG, [68Ga]Ga-Citrate, [11C]Methionine, and [11C]Donepezil in a Porcine Osteomyelitis Model","Lars Jødal, Svend B Jensen, Ole L Nielsen, Pia Afzelius, Per Borghammer, Aage K O Alstrup, Søren B Hansen","Introduction: Positron emission tomography (PET) is increasingly applied for infection imaging using [18F]FDG as tracer, but uptake is unspecific. The present study compares the kinetics of [18F]FDG and three other PET tracers with relevance for infection imaging.

Methods: A juvenile porcine osteomyelitis model was used. Eleven pigs underwent PET/CT with 60-minute dynamic PET imaging of [18F]FDG, [68Ga]Ga-citrate, [11C]methionine, and/or [11C]donepezil, along with blood sampling. For infectious lesions, kinetic modelling with one- and two-tissue-compartment models was conducted for each tracer.

Results: Irreversible uptake was found for [18F]FDG and [68Ga]Ga-citrate; reversible uptake was found for [11C]methionine (two-tissue model) and [11C]donepezil (one-tissue model). The uptake rate for [68Ga]Ga-citrate was slow and diffusion-limited. For the other tracers, the uptake rate was primarily determined by perfusion (flow-limited uptake). Net uptake rate for [18F]FDG and distribution volume for [11C]methionine were significantly higher for infectious lesions than for correspondingly noninfected tissue. For [11C]donepezil in pigs, labelled metabolite products appeared to be important for the analysis.

Conclusions: The kinetics of the four studied tracers in infection was characterized. For clinical applications, [18F]FDG remains the first-choice PET tracer. [11C]methionine may have a potential for detecting soft tissue infections. [68Ga]Ga-citrate and [11C]donepezil were not found useful for imaging of osteomyelitis.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29114181/
Error-corrected estimation of regional kinetic parameter histograms directly from pet projections,"Harri Pölönen, Jari Niemi, Ulla Ruotsalainen","Positron emission tomography (PET) is a unique method to investigate physiology in the living body. Kinetic models with kinetic rate constants describe the dynamic radioactive tracer uptake in living tissue. If the variation of the kinetic parameter values within a specific tissue region could be determined accurately, it would give valuable quantitative information about the tissue heterogeneity. In this study we developed a unique method to estimate the variation from the regional kinetic parameter histograms. To determine the kinetic parameter values, we chose non-penalized maximum likelihood (ML) estimation due to the specific statistical error properties of the ML estimates. The parameter values were estimated directly from the time series of PET projections. The choice of the estimation method enabled us to utilize the ML theory in error correction. We developed a Monte Carlo approach to determine the regional error distributions. The true variation of the kinetic parameters could then be revealed by correcting the regional ML estimate histograms with the estimated error distributions. The method was tested with simulated data. In simulations both the average and the deviation of the kinetic parameters were determined from the error-corrected histograms with good numerical accuracy for the selected region of interest.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21098924/
Noninvasive nuclear imaging enables the in vivo quantification of striatal dopamine receptor expression and raclopride affinity in mice,"Kristina Fischer, Vesna Sossi, Andreas Schmid, Martin Thunemann, Florian C Maier, Martin S Judenhofer, Julia G Mannheim, Gerald Reischl, Bernd J Pichler","The increasing use of genetically engineered mice as animal models of human disease in biomedical research, latest advances in imaging technologies, and development of novel, highly specific radiolabeled biomarkers provide great potential to study receptor expression and gene function in vivo in mice. (11)C-raclopride is a widely used PET tracer to measure striatal D(2) receptor binding and was used to test the feasibility of the multiple-ligand-concentration receptor assay for D(2) receptor quantification.

Methods: Mice underwent a total of 4 scans with decreasing specific activities from 141 to 0.4 GBq/μmol, corresponding to (11)C-raclopride injected doses of 2.4 to 1,274 nmol/kg, using either a standard bolus injection protocol (n = 12) or a bolus-plus-constant infusion protocol to attain true equilibrium conditions (n = 7). Receptor occupancy was plotted as a function of raclopride dose, and D(2) receptor density and raclopride affinity were calculated using linear and nonlinear regression analysis, respectively. In addition, we used ex vivo autoradiography, a more spatially accurate imaging technology, to validate the in vivo PET measurements, and we performed test-retest experiments to determine the reproducibility and reliability of the PET-derived measures.

Results: The receptor occupancy curves showed that an injected tracer dose of 4.5 nmol/kg induces approximately 10% receptor occupancy, whereas 1% receptor occupancy will be achieved at tracer doses of approximately 0.45 nmol/kg. Using the bolus injection protocol and nonlinear regression analysis, we determined that the average D(2) receptor density was 9.6 ± 1.1 pmol/mL, and the apparent raclopride affinity was 5.0 ± 0.6 pmol/mL. These values agreed well with those obtained at true equilibrium conditions. In contrast, linear Scatchard analysis did not lead to the expected linear relationship because nonsaturable binding was observed at high raclopride concentrations, and thus, it seems to be unsuitable for quantitative (11)C-raclopride analysis in mice.

Conclusion: Our data showed that the tracer mass, if higher than 4 nmol/kg, can strongly affect binding parameter estimations and must be considered when performing kinetic analysis, specifically in mice. We also demonstrated that the in vivo determination of D(2) receptor density and raclopride affinity is feasible in mice using multiple-injection protocols and nonlinear regression analysis.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21680681/
"Evaluation of radioselenium labeled selenomethionine, a potential tracer for brain protein synthesis by PET","R Bergmann, P Brust, G Kampf, H H Coenen, G Stöcklin","The blood-brain transfer, protein incorporation and metabolism of L-[75Se]selenomethionine (SeMet) of relatively high specific activity (> 400 GBq mmol) were studied in male Wistar rats. The highest uptake was found in the pancreas, followed by the tumor, kidney, liver, brain and muscle. In addition, plasma and brain samples of rats were analyzed for labeled fractions of free SeMet, metabolites, and SeMet bound to t-RNA and proteins. For example, free SeMet represented more than 80% of brain radioactivity at 1.5 min while it was less than 15% at 360 min. A concomitant increase was observed for protein bound SeMet in brain. A three-compartment model was applied to calculate the blood-brain transfer constant (K1 (0.15 +/- 0.070 mL g-1 min-1) and the rate constant of SeMet incorporation into proteins (k3 = 0.026 +/- 0.008 min-1). The apparent incorporation of methionine into proteins was estimated to be about 0.73 nmol g-1 min-1. From the studies it is concluded that the use of L-[75Se]selenomethionine may be appropriate to measure brain protein incorporation in humans with PET.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7550024/
Analysis of [C-11]alpha-methyl-tryptophan kinetics for the estimation of serotonin synthesis rate in vivo,"O Muzik, D C Chugani, P Chakraborty, T Mangner, H T Chugani","We describe the tracer kinetic analysis of [C-11]-labeled alpha-methyl-tryptophan (AMT), an analogue of tryptophan, which has been developed as a tracer for serotonin synthesis using positron emission tomography (PET) in human brain. Dynamic PET data were acquired from young healthy volunteers (n = 10) as a series of 22 scans covering a total of 60 minutes and analyzed by means of a three-compartment, four-parameter model. In addition, functional images of the K-complex were created using the Patlak-plot approach. The application of a three-compartment model resulted in low identifiability of individual k-values, especially that of k3. Model identifiability analysis using a singular value decomposition of the final sensitivity matrix showed parameter identifiability to increase by 50% when the Patlak-plot approach was used. K-complex values derived by the Patlak-plot approach overestimated the compartmental values by 10 to 20%, because of the violation of the dynamic equilibrium assumption. However, this bias was fairly constant in all structures of the brain. The rank order of K-complex values from different brain regions corresponded well to the regional concentrations of serotonin in human brain (P < 0.0001). These results indicate that the Patlak-plot method can be readily applied to [C-11]AMT data in order to create functional images of the K-complex, reflecting serotonin synthesis rate, within an acceptable error margin.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9236722/
Quantification of Tau Load in Alzheimer's Disease Clinical Trials Using Positron Emission Tomography,"Tessa Timmers, Bart N M van Berckel, Adriaan A Lammertsma, Rik Ossenkoppele","Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative condition that is neuropathologically characterized by the presence of amyloid-β plaques and neurofibrillary tangles consisting of tau. Recently, several positron emission tomography (PET) tracers have been developed that yielded promising initial results. In this chapter, we discuss how tau PET can be used in the context in clinical trials. We argue that simplified reference tissue models based on dynamic data acquisition are most suitable for accurately measuring changes in tau pathology in trials tailored to reduce cerebral tau load. Therefore, we discuss the importance of tracer kinetic modeling and describe in detail how a reliable measurement of specific binding can be obtained.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29512076/
Kinetic Modelling and Test-Retest Reproducibility for the Dopamine D1R Radioligand [11C]SCH23390 in Healthy and Diseased Mice,"Daniele Bertoglio, Jeroen Verhaeghe, Alan Miranda, Leonie Wyffels, Sigrid Stroobants, Celia Dominguez, Ignacio Munoz-Sanjuan, Mette Skinbjerg, Longbin Liu, Steven Staelens","Purpose: Our aim in this study was to compare different non-invasive pharmacokinetic models and assess test-retest reproducibility of the radioligand [11C]SCH23390 for the quantification of dopamine D1-like receptor (D1R) in both wild-type (WT) mice and heterozygous (HET) Q175DN mice as Huntington's disease (HD) model.

Procedures: Adult WT (n = 9) and HET (n = 14) mice underwent a 90-min [11C]SCH23390 positron emission tomography (PET) scan followed by computed tomography (CT) to evaluate the pharmacokinetic modelling in healthy and diseased conditions. Additionally, 5 WT mice and 7 HET animals received a second [11C]SCH23390 PET scan for test-retest reproducibility. Parallel assessment of the simplified reference tissue model (SRTM), the multilinear reference tissue model (MRTM) and the Logan reference tissue model (Logan Ref) using the striatum as a receptor-rich region and the cerebellum as a receptor-free (reference) region was performed to define the most suitable method for regional- and voxel-based quantification of the binding potential (BPND). Finally, standardised uptake value ratio (SUVR-1) was assessed as a potential simplified measurement.

Results: For all models, we measured a significant decline in dopamine D1R density (e.g. SRTM = - 38.5 ± 5.0 %, p < 0.0001) in HET mice compared to WT littermates. Shortening the 90-min scan duration resulted in large underestimation of striatal BPNDin both WT mice (SRTM 60 min: - 17.7 ± 2.8 %, p = 0.0078) and diseased HET (SRTM 60 min: - 13.1 ± 4.1 %, p = 0.0001). Striatal BPNDmeasurements were very reproducible with an average test-retest variability below 5 % when using both MRTM and SRTM. Parametric BPNDmaps generated with SRTM were highly reliable, showing nearly perfect agreement to the regional analysis (r2= 0.99, p < 0.0001). Finally, SRTM provided the most accurate estimate for relative tracer delivery R1with both regional- and voxel-based analyses. SUVR-1 at different time intervals were not sufficiently reliable when compared to BPND(r2< 0.66).

Conclusions: Ninety-minute acquisition and the use of SRTM for pharmacokinetic modelling is recommended. [11C]SCH23390 PET imaging demonstrates optimal characteristics for the study of dopamine D1R density in models of psychiatric and neurological disorders as exemplified in the Q175DN mouse model of HD.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33179158/
Assessing hypoxia in animal tumor models based on pharmocokinetic analysis of dynamic FAZA PET,"Morten Busk, Ole Lajord Munk, Steen Jakobsen, Tobias Wang, Marianne Skals, Torben Steiniche, Michael Robert Horsman, Jens Overgaard","Positron emission tomography (PET) allows non-invasive detection and mapping of tumor hypoxia. However, slow tracer kinetics and low resolution, results in limited tumor-to-normal tissue contrast and the risk of missing areas where hypoxic cells are intermixed with necrosis. The shape of tumor time activity curves (TACs), as deduced from dynamic scans, may allow further separation of tumors/tumor sub-volumes that are inseparable based on static scans. This study was designed to define the added value of dynamic scans.

Material and methods: Three squamous cell carcinoma tumor models were grown in mice. Mice were injected with the (18)F-labeled PET hypoxia-tracer fluoroazomycin arabinoside (FAZA) and the immunologically-detectable hypoxia-marker pimonidazole, and PET scanned dynamically for three to six hours. Subsequently, microregional tracer retention (autoradiography) and the distribution of pimonidazole-retaining cells (immunohistology) and necrosis were analyzed in tumor tissue sections. Dynamic PET data were analysed based on a two-compartment model with irreversible tracer binding generating estimates of the putative hypoxia surrogate markers k(3) (tracer trapping rate constant) and K(i) (influx rate constant from plasma into irreversible bound tracer).

Results/discussion: High tumor-to-reference tissue ratios and a strong linear correlation (R∼0.7 to 0.95) between density of hypoxic cells and FAZA concentration was observed three hours after tracer administration, suggesting that late time PET images provides an accurate measure of hypoxia against which kinetic model estimates can be validated. Tumor TACs varied widely (ranging from distinctly wash-out to accumulative type) among tumor types although pimonidazole-stainings revealed extensive hypoxia in all models. Kinetic analysis of tumor sub-volumes showed that k(3) correlated poorly with late time FAZA retention regionally in two of the three tumor models. The influx rate constant K(i) displayed far less variability and correlated strongly with late time FAZA retention (hypoxia) in two of three tumor models, whereas a non-consistent relationship was observed in the last tumor model. Our study demonstrates the potential usefulness of dynamic PET, but also that a simple two-compartment model may be inappropriate in some tumor models.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20831479/
Characterization and Validation of Radiotracer Kinetics Using the Langendorff Isolated Perfused Heart,"Friedrich Baark, Edward C T Waters, Thomas R Eykyn, Richard Southworth","The Langendorff isolated perfused heart is a physiologically relevant and controllable ex vivo model well suited to characterizing and validating novel radiotracers for a wide range of molecular imaging applications. It allows the monitoring of first pass tracer uptake kinetics either as a bolus injection or as a continuous infusion in beating myocardial tissue with a high degree of experimental control in terms of cardiac workload, perfusion, energy substrate delivery and composition, and drug co-administration. The radiotracer pharmacokinetic data that it provides is not contaminated by confounding factors such as off-target tracer metabolism, and as a non-imaging technique, time activity curves can be acquired with very high temporal resolution. In this chapter, we describe the basic principles and practice for setting up and using Langendorff isolated perfused hearts for the assessment of novel radiotracers and outline their potential for modeling pathophysiological conditions relevant to cardiovascular disease.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38006501/
Fractal and multifractal analysis of PET/CT images of metastatic melanoma before and after treatment with ipilimumab,"Christina-Marina Breki, Antonia Dimitrakopoulou-Strauss, Jessica Hassel, Theoharis Theoharis, Christos Sachpekidis, Leyun Pan, Astero Provata","Background: PET/CT with F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) images of patients suffering from metastatic melanoma have been analysed using fractal and multifractal analysis to assess the impact of monoclonal antibody ipilimumab treatment with respect to therapy outcome.

Results: Thirty-one cases of patients suffering from metastatic melanoma have been scanned before and after two and after four cycles of treatment. For each patient, we calculated the fractal and multifractal dimensions using the box-counting method on the digitalised PET/CT images of all three studies to assess the therapeutic outcome. We modelled the spreading of malignant cells in the body via kinetic Monte Carlo simulations to address the dynamical evolution of the metastatic process and to predict the spatial distribution of malignant lesions. Our analysis shows that the fractal dimensions which describe the tracer dispersion in the body decrease consistently with the deterioration of the patient's therapeutic outcome condition. In 20 out of 24 cases, the fractal analysis results match those of the treatment outcome as defined by the oncologists, while 7 cases are considered as special cases because the patients had non-tumour-related findings or side effects which affect the results. The decrease in the fractal dimensions with the deterioration of the patient conditions (in terms of disease progression) is attributed to the hierarchical localisation of the tracer which accumulates in the affected lesions and does not spread homogeneously throughout the body. Fractality emerges as a result of the migration patterns which the malignant cells follow for propagating within the body (circulatory system, lymphatic system). Analysis of the multifractal spectrum complements and supports the results of the fractal analysis. In the kinetic Monte Carlo modelling of the metastatic process, a small number of malignant cells diffuse through a fractal medium representing the blood circulatory network. Along their way, the malignant cells engender random metastases (colonies) with a small probability and, as a result, fractal spatial distributions of the metastases are formed similar to the ones observed in the PET/CT images.

Conclusions: The Monte Carlo-generated spatial distribution of metastases changes with time approaching values close to the ones recorded in the metastatic patients. Thus, we propose that fractal and multifractal analyses have potential applications in quantification of the evaluation of PET/CT images to monitor the disease evolution as well as the response to different medical treatments. The proposed approach, being operator independent, can offer new diagnostic tools in parallel to the visual location of the lesions and may improve multiparameter assessment of FDG PET/CT studies.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27473846/
Evaluation of deuterated 18F- and 11C-labeled choline analogs for cancer detection by positron emission tomography,"Timothy H Witney, Israt S Alam, David R Turton, Graham Smith, Laurence Carroll, Diana Brickute, Frazer J Twyman, Quang-Dé Nguyen, Giampaolo Tomasi, Ramla O Awais, Eric O Aboagye","Purpose: (11)C-Choline-positron emission tomography (PET) has been exploited to detect the aberrant choline metabolism in tumors. Radiolabeled choline uptake within the imaging time is primarily a function of transport, phosphorylation, and oxidation. Rapid choline oxidation, however, complicates interpretation of PET data. In this study, we investigated the biologic basis of the oxidation of deuterated choline analogs and assessed their specificity in human tumor xenografts.

Experimental design: (11)C-Choline, (11)C-methyl-[1,2-(2)H(4)]-choline ((11)C-D4-choline), and (18)F-D4-choline were synthesized to permit comparison. Biodistribution, metabolism, small-animal PET studies, and kinetic analysis of tracer uptake were carried out in human colon HCT116 xenograft-bearing mice.

Results: Oxidation of choline analogs to betaine was highest with (11)C-choline, with reduced oxidation observed with (11)C-D4-choline and substantially reduced with (18)F-D4-choline, suggesting that both fluorination and deuteration were important for tracer metabolism. Although all tracers were converted intracellularly to labeled phosphocholine (specific signal), the higher rate constants for intracellular retention (K(i) and k(3)) of (11)C-choline and (11)C-D4-choline, compared with (18)F-D4-choline, were explained by the rapid conversion of the nonfluorinated tracers to betaine within HCT116 tumors. Imaging studies showed that the uptake of (18)F-D4-choline in three tumors with similar radiotracer delivery (K(1)) and choline kinase α expression-HCT116, A375, and PC3-M-were the same, suggesting that (18)F-D4-choline has utility for cancer detection irrespective of histologic type.

Conclusion: We have shown here that both deuteration and fluorination combine to provide protection against choline oxidation in vivo. (18)F-D4-choline showed the highest selectivity for phosphorylation and warrants clinical evaluation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22235095/
Development of Novel PSMA Ligands for Imaging and Therapy with Copper Isotopes,"José Carlos Dos Santos, Barbro Beijer, Ulrike Bauder-Wüst, Martin Schäfer, Karin Leotta, Matthias Eder, Martina Benešová, Christian Kleist, Frederik Giesel, Clemens Kratochwil, Klaus Kopka, Uwe Haberkorn, Walter Mier","Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-binding tracers have been shown to be promising agents for the specific targeting of prostate tumors. On labeling with the short-lived isotopes18F and68Ga, excellent molecular imaging performance is achieved. This potential could be further exploited using long-lived isotopes. Because of the favorable half-life of64Cu, tracers labeled with this PET nuclide could solve logistic problems. Moreover, this isotope provides a theranostic pair with the therapeutic copper isotope67Cu. Hence, 9 novel tracers that combine dedicated copper chelators with the PSMA-specific urea-based binding motif were developed.Methods:The precursors were obtained by solid-phase synthesis. The purity and molecular weight of the PSMA ligands were confirmed by high-performance liquid chromatography and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The compounds were labeled with64Cu, with a radiolabeling yield of more than 99%. Competitive cell binding assays and internalization assays were performed with C4-2 cells, a subline of the PSMA-positive cell line LNCaP (human lymph node carcinoma of the prostate). In vitro serum stability, the stability of64Cu-CA003 in blood, and the in vivo fate of neat64Cu-chloride or64Cu-CA003 were determined to prove whether the stability of the radiolabeled compounds is sufficient to ensure no significant loss of copper during the targeting process. For PET imaging and biodistribution studies, a C4-2 tumor-bearing mouse model was used.Results:The radiolabeled64Cu-PSMA ligands showed high serum stability. All PSMA ligands showed high inhibition potencies, with equilibrium inhibition constants in the low nanomolar range.64Cu-CA003 and64Cu-CA005 showed high internalization ratios (34.6% ± 2.8 and 18.6% ± 4.4, respectively). Both the in vitro serum stability determination and the in vivo characterization of the main radiolabeled compounds confirmed that, except for64Cu-PSMA-617, all compounds showed high serum stability within the observation period of 24 h. Small-animal PET imaging demonstrated high tumor uptake within 20 min. Organ distribution studies confirmed high specific uptake in the tumor, with 30.8 ± 12.6 percentage injected dose (%ID)/g at 1 h after injection. Rapid clearance from the kidneys was observed-a decrease from 67.0 ± 20.9 %ID/g at 1 h after injection to 7.5 ± 8.51 %ID/g at 24 h after injection (in the case of CA003). The performance of CA003, the compound with the best preclinical properties, was assessed in a first patient. In line with its preclinical data, PET imaging resulted in clear visualization of the cancer lesions, with high contrast.Conclusion:The64Cu-labeled PSMA ligands are promising agents to target PSMA and visualize PSMA-positive tumor lesions as shown in preclinical evaluation by small-animal PET studies, organ distribution, and a patient application. Most importantly, the images obtained at 20 h enabled delineation of unclear lesions, showing that the compounds fulfill the prerequisite for dosimetry in the course of therapy planning with67Cu. Thus, we suggest clinical use of copper-labeled CA003 for diagnostics and radiotherapy of prostate cancer.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31541034/
Quantification of Tumor Hypoxic Fractions Using Positron Emission Tomography with [18F]Fluoromisonidazole ([18F]FMISO) Kinetic Analysis and Invasive Oxygen Measurements,"Olivia J Kelada, Sara Rockwell, Ming-Qiang Zheng, Yiyun Huang, Yanfeng Liu, Carmen J Booth, Roy H Decker, Uwe Oelfke, Richard E Carson, David J Carlson","Purpose: The purpose of this study is to use dynamic [18F]fluoromisonidazole ([18F]FMISO) positron emission tomography (PET) to compare estimates of tumor hypoxic fractions (HFs) derived by tracer kinetic modeling, tissue-to-blood ratios (TBR), and independent oxygen (pO2) measurements.

Procedures: BALB/c mice with EMT6 subcutaneous tumors were selected for PET imaging and invasive pO2measurements. Data from 120-min dynamic [18F]FMISO scans were fit to two-compartment irreversible three rate constant (K1, k2, k3) and Patlak models (Ki). Tumor HFs were calculated and compared using Ki, k3, TBR, and pO2values. The clinical impact of each method was evaluated on [18F]FMISO scans for three non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) radiotherapy patients.

Results: HFs defined by TBR (≥1.2, ≥1.3, and ≥1.4) ranged from 2 to 85 % of absolute tumor volume. HFs defined by Ki(>0.004 ml min cm-3) and k3(>0.008 min-1) varied from 9 to 85 %. HF quantification was highly dependent on metric (TBR, k3, or Ki) and threshold. HFs quantified on human [18F]FMISO scans varied from 38 to 67, 0 to 14, and 0.1 to 27 %, for each patient, respectively, using TBR, k3, and Kimetrics.

Conclusions: [18F]FMISO PET imaging metric choice and threshold impacts hypoxia quantification reliability.

Novel Kappa Opioid Receptor Agonist as Improved PET Radiotracer: Development and in Vivo Evaluation,"Songye Li, Ming-Qiang Zheng, Mika Naganawa, Hong Gao, Richard Pracitto, Anupama Shirali, Shu-Fei Lin, Jo-Ku Teng, Jim Ropchan, Yiyun Huang","The kappa opioid receptor (KOR) is involved in depression, alcoholism, and drug abuse. The current agonist radiotracer11C-GR103545 is not ideal for imaging KOR due to its slow tissue kinetics in human. The aim of our project was to develop novel KOR agonist radiotracers with improved imaging properties. A novel compound FEKAP ((( R))-4-(2-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)acetyl)-3-((ethyl(2-fluoroethyl)amino)methyl) piperazine-1-carboxylate) was designed, synthesized, and assayed for in vitro binding affinities. It was then radiolabeled and evaluated in rhesus monkeys. Baseline and blocking scans were conducted on a Focus-220 scanner to assess binding specificity and selectivity. Metabolite-corrected arterial activities over time were measured and used as input functions to analyze the brain regional time-activity curves and derive kinetic and binding parameters with kinetic modeling. FEKAP displayed high KOR binding affinity ( Ki= 0.43 nM) and selectivity (17-fold over mu opioid receptor and 323-fold over delta opioid receptor) in vitro.11C-FEKAP was prepared in high molar activity (mean of 718 GBq/μmol, n = 19) and >99% radiochemical purity. In monkeys,11C-FEKAP metabolized fairly fast, with ∼31% of intact parent fraction at 30 min post-injection. In the brain, it exhibited fast and reversible kinetics with good uptake. Pretreatment with the nonselective opioid receptor antagonist naloxone (1 mg/kg) decreased uptake in high binding regions to the level in the cerebellum, and the selective KOR antagonist LY2456302 (0.02 and 0.1 mg/kg) reduced11C-FEKAP specific binding in a dose-dependent manner. As a measure of specific binding signals, the mean binding potential ( BPND) values of11C-FEKAP derived from the multilinear analysis-1 (MA1) method were greater than 0.5 for all regions, except for the thalamus.

Methods: In our prospective study we included patients with malignant breast tumours. Dynamic PET acquisition lasted for 60 minutes after tracer (FDG) injection. Every study was assessed by the same two experienced observers. We assessed plasma activity noninvasively. In case of the primary tumour VOIs we applied two different approaches to correct motion artefacts: method I) frame-by-frame manual motion correction; method II) frame-by-frame semi-automatic software-based motion correction. FDG two-compartment kinetic modelling was applied to assess K<inf>1</inf>, k<inf>2</inf>, k<inf>3</inf> rate coefficients and to calculate K<inf>i</inf> (tracer flux constant) and MRFDG (FDG metabolic rate).

Results: Thirty-five lesions detected during 34 dynamic studies were included in this current analysis. Interrater reliability of both applied motion correction methods proved to be excellent (ICC=0.89-0.99), except K<inf>i</inf> measured by method I (ICC=0.66). Bland-Altman analysis revealed that method II resulted in significantly lower values than method I regarding k<inf>3</inf> and K<inf>i</inf> in case of both observers, and regarding MRFDG in one of the observers. In case of K<inf>1</inf> and k<inf>2</inf> the two methods were in good agreement.

Conclusions: Both applied methods proved to be reproducible and reliable, especially method II, where every measured kinetic parameter showed excellent interrater reliability. Different approaches of motion correction could have a significant effect on the results of the kinetic modelling; therefore careful selection of the most reliable method is advised.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30792380/
Capillaries within compartments: microvascular interpretation of dynamic positron emission tomography data,"Ole Lajord Munk, Susanne Keiding, Ludvik Bass","Measurement of exchange of substances between blood and tissue has been a long-lasting challenge to physiologists, and considerable theoretical and experimental accomplishments were achieved before the development of the positron emission tomography (PET). Today, when modeling data from modern PET scanners, little use is made of earlier microvascular research in the compartmental models, which have become the standard model by which the vast majority of dynamic PET data are analysed. However, modern PET scanners provide data with a sufficient temporal resolution and good counting statistics to allow estimation of parameters in models with more physiological realism. We explore the standard compartmental model and find that incorporation of blood flow leads to paradoxes, such as kinetic rate constants being time-dependent, and tracers being cleared from a capillary faster than they can be supplied by blood flow. The inability of the standard model to incorporate blood flow consequently raises a need for models that include more physiology, and we develop microvascular models which remove the inconsistencies. The microvascular models can be regarded as a revision of the input function. Whereas the standard model uses the organ inlet concentration as the concentration throughout the vascular compartment, we consider models that make use of spatial averaging of the concentrations in the capillary volume, which is what the PET scanner actually registers. The microvascular models are developed for both single- and multi-capillary systems and include effects of non-exchanging vessels. They are suitable for analysing dynamic PET data from any capillary bed using either intravascular or diffusible tracers, in terms of physiological parameters which include regional blood flow.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14559065/
Development of caspase-3-selective activity-based probes for PET imaging of apoptosis,"Louis Lauwerys, Lucas Beroske, Angelo Solania, Christel Vangestel, Alan Miranda, Nele Van Giel, Karuna Adhikari, Anne-Marie Lambeir, Leonie Wyffels, Dennis Wolan, Pieter Van der Veken, Filipe Elvas","Background: The cysteine-aspartic acid protease caspase-3 is recognized as the main executioner of apoptosis in cells responding to specific extrinsic and intrinsic stimuli. Caspase-3 represents an interesting biomarker to evaluate treatment response, as many cancer therapies exert their effect by inducing tumour cell death. Previously developed caspase-3 PET tracers were unable to reach routine clinical use due to low tumour uptake or lack of target selectivity, which are two important requirements for effective treatment response evaluation in cancer patients. Therefore, the goal of this study was to develop and preclinically evaluate novel caspase-3-selective activity-based probes (ABPs) for apoptosis imaging.

Results: A library of caspase-3-selective ABPs was developed for tumour apoptosis detection. In a first attempt, the inhibitor Ac-DW3-KE (Ac-3Pal-Asp-βhLeu-Phe-Asp-KE) was18F-labelled on the N-terminus to generate a radiotracer that was incapable of adequately detecting an increase in apoptosis in vivo. The inability to effectively detect active caspase-3 in vivo was likely attributable to slow binding, as demonstrated with in vitro inhibition kinetics. Hence, a second generation of caspase-3 selective ABPs was developed based on the Ac-ATS010-KE (Ac-3Pal-Asp-Phe(F5)-Phe-Asp-KE) with greatly improved binding kinetics over Ac-DW3-KE. Our probes based on Ac-ATS010-KE were made by modifying the N-terminus with 6 different linkers. All the linker modifications had limited effect on the binding kinetics, target selectivity, and pharmacokinetic profile in healthy mice. In an in vitro apoptosis model, the least hydrophilic tracer [18F]MICA-316 showed an increased uptake in apoptotic cells in comparison to the control group. Finally, [18F]MICA-316 was tested in an in vivo colorectal cancer model, where it showed a limited tumour uptake and was unable to discriminate treated tumours from the untreated group, despite demonstrating that the radiotracer was able to bind caspase-3 in complex mixtures in vitro. In contrast, the phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)-binding radiotracer [99mTc]Tc-duramycin was able to recognize the increased cell death in the disease model, making it the best performing treatment response assessment tracer developed thus far.

Conclusions: In conclusion, a novel library of caspase-3-binding PET tracers retaining similar binding kinetics as the original inhibitor was developed. The most promising tracer, [18F]MICA-316, showed an increase uptake in an in vitro apoptosis model and was able to selectively bind caspase-3 in apoptotic tumour cells. In order to distinguish therapy-responsive from non-responsive tumours, the next generation of caspase-3-selective ABPs will be developed with higher tumour accumulation and in vivo stability.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39117920/
From Structure-Activity Relationships on Thiazole Derivatives to the In Vivo Evaluation of a New Radiotracer for Cannabinoid Subtype 2 PET Imaging,"Fabien Caillé, Fanny Cacheux, Marie-Anne Peyronneau, Benoît Jego, Emilie Jaumain, Géraldine Pottier, Christoph Ullmer, Uwe Grether, Alexandra Winkeler, Frédéric Dollé, Annelaure Damont, Bertrand Kuhnast","Upregulation of the cannabinoid type 2 receptors (CB2R) unveils inflammation processes of pathological disorders, such as cancer, pain, or neurodegenerative diseases. Among others, CB2R agonist A-836339 has been labeled with carbon-11 for PET imaging of the CB2R and displayed promising results in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. The aim of the present work was to develop fluorinated analogs of A-836339 for labeling with fluorine-18 to design a new PET tracer for CB2R imaging. Seven fluorinated analogs of A-836339 were synthesized in two to three steps and their binding affinities and selectivities for both the human and the mouse CB2R were measured as well as their early ADME profiles. Among them, compound 2f (KihCB2R= 0.1 nM, KihCB1R/KihCB2R= 300) displayed high affinity and selectivity for CB2R but also promising lipophilicity, kinetic solubility, and membrane permeation properties and was further selected for in vitro metabolism studies. Incubation of 2f with human or rat liver microsomes followed by LC/MS analysis revealed the presence of six different metabolites mainly resulting from oxidation reactions. A tosylated precursor of 2f was synthesized in two steps and radiolabeled with fluorine-18 to afford [18F]2f in 15 ± 5% radiochemical yield and a molar activity of 110 ± 30 GBq/μmol. Autoradiographies of rat spleen and biodistribution studies in healthy rats including pretreatments with either CB2R or CB1R-specific compounds suggested that [18F]2f is a specific tracer for the CB2R in vivo. We have therefore demonstrated here that [18F]2f is a promising novel tracer for imaging CB2R in vivo using PET. Further investigation in animal models of inflammation will follow.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28968497/
"Comparison of HRRT and HR+ scanners for quantitative (R)-[11C]verapamil, [11C]raclopride and [11C]flumazenil brain studies","Floris H P van Velden, Syahir M Mansor, Daniëlle M E van Assema, Bart N M van Berckel, Femke E Froklage, Shaonan Wang, Robert C Schuit, Marie-Claude Asselin, Adriaan A Lammertsma, Ronald Boellaard, Marc C Huisman","Purpose: This study was conducted to directly compare the high-resolution research tomograph (HRRT) (high-resolution brain) and HR+ (standard whole-body) positron emission tomography (PET) only scanners for quantitative brain studies using three tracers with vastly different tracer distributions.

Procedures: Healthy volunteers underwent successive scans on HR+ and HRRT scanners (in random order) using either (R)-[(11)C]verapamil (n = 6), [(11)C]raclopride (n = 7) or [(11)C]flumazenil (n = 7). For all tracers, metabolite-corrected plasma-input functions were generated.

Results: After resolution matching, HRRT-derived kinetic parameter values correlated well with those of HR+ for all tracers (intraclass correlation coefficients ≥0.78), having a good absolute interscanner test-retest variability (≤15 %). However, systematic differences can be seen for HRRT-derived kinetic parameter values (range -13 to +15 %).

Conclusion: Quantification of kinetic parameters based on plasma-input models leads to comparable results when spatial resolution between HRRT and HR+ data is matched. When using reference-tissue models, differences remain that are likely caused by differences in attenuation and scatter corrections and/or image reconstruction.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25028091/
Development and In Vivo Preclinical Imaging of Fluorine-18-Labeled Synaptic Vesicle Protein 2A (SV2A) PET Tracers,"Cristian C Constantinescu, Cedric Tresse, MingQiang Zheng, Alexandra Gouasmat, Vincent M Carroll, Laetitia Mistico, David Alagille, Christine M Sandiego, Caroline Papin, Kenneth Marek, John P Seibyl, Gilles D Tamagnan, Olivier Barret","Purpose: Synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A) serves as a biomarker of synaptic density and positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of SV2A could provide a tool to assess progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Two tracers have primarily been reported and characterized in vivo: [11C]UCB-J and [18F]UCB-H. In early human studies, [11C]UCB-J showed promising results, while its F-18-labeled analogue [18F]UCB-H showed suboptimal specific signal in comparison to [11C]UCB-J. Considering the limited use of [11C]UCB-J to facilities with a cyclotron, having a F-18 variant would facilitate large, multicenter imaging trials. We have screened several F-18 derivatives of UCB-J in non-human primates and identified a promising F-18 PET candidate, [18F]MNI-1126, with additional investigations of the racemate [18F]MNI-1038, affording a signal comparable to [11C]UCB-J.

Procedures: F-18 derivatives of UCB-J and UCB-H were synthesized and administered to non-human primates for microPET imaging. Following screenings, [18F]MNI-1038 (racemate) and [18F]MNI-1126 (R-enantiomer) were identified with the highest signal and favorable kinetics and were selected for further imaging. Kinetic modeling with one- and two-tissue compartmental models, and linear methods were applied to PET data using metabolite-corrected arterial input function. Pre-block scans with levetiracetam (LEV, 10, 30 mg/kg, iv) were performed to determine the tracers' in vivo specificity for SV2A. Two whole-body PET studies were performed with [18F]MNI-1038 in one male and one female rhesus, and radiation absorbed dose estimates and effective dose (ED, ICRP-103) were estimated with OLINDA/EXM 2.0.

Results: All compounds screened displayed very good brain penetration, with a plasma-free fraction of ~ 40 %. [18F]MNI-1126 and [18F]MNI-1038 showed uptake and distribution the most consistent with UCB-J, while the other derivatives showed suboptimal results, with similar or lower uptake than [18F]UCB-H. VTof [18F]MNI-1126 and [18F]MNI-1038 was high in all gray matter regions (within animal averages ~ 30 ml/cm3) and highly correlated with [11C]UCB-J (r > 0.99). Pre-blocking of [18F]MNI-1126 or [18F]MNI-1038 with LEV showed robust occupancy across all gray matter regions, similar to that reported with [11C]UCB-J (~ 85 % at 30 mg/kg, ~ 65 % at 10 mg/kg). Using the centrum semiovale as a reference region, BPNDof [18F]MNI-1126 reached values of up to ~ 30 to 40 % higher than those reported for [11C]UCB-J. From whole-body imaging average ED of [18F]MNI-1038 was estimated to be 22.3 μSv/MBq, with tracer being eliminated via both urinary and hepatobiliary pathways.

Conclusions: We have identified a F-18-labeled tracer ([18F]MNI-1126) that exhibits comparable in vivo characteristics and specificity for SV2A to [11C]UCB-J in non-human primates, which makes [18F]MNI-1126 a promising PET radiotracer for imaging SV2A in human trials.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30084043/
Quantification of [18F]DPA-714 binding in the human brain: initial studies in healthy controls and Alzheimer's disease patients,"Sandeep S V Golla, Ronald Boellaard, Vesa Oikonen, Anja Hoffmann, Bart N M van Berckel, Albert D Windhorst, Jere Virta, Merja Haaparanta-Solin, Pauliina Luoto, Nina Savisto, Olof Solin, Ray Valencia, Andrea Thiele, Jonas Eriksson, Robert C Schuit, Adriaan A Lammertsma, Juha O Rinne","Fluorine-18 labelled N,N-diethyl-2-(2-[4-(2-fluoroethoxy)phenyl]-5,7-dimethylpyrazolo[1,5-α]pyrimidine-3-yl)acetamide ([(18)F]DPA-714) binds to the 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO) with high affinity. The aim of this initial methodological study was to develop a plasma input tracer kinetic model for quantification of [(18)F]DPA-714 binding in healthy subjects and Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, and to provide a preliminary assessment whether there is a disease-related signal. Ten AD patients and six healthy subjects underwent a dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) study along with arterial sampling and a scan protocol of 150 minutes after administration of 250 ± 10 MBq [(18)F]DPA-714. The model that provided the best fits to tissue time activity curves (TACs) was selected based on Akaike Information Criterion and F-test. The reversible two tissue compartment plasma input model with blood volume parameter was the preferred model for quantification of [(18)F]DPA-714 kinetics, irrespective of scan duration, volume of interest, and underlying volume of distribution (VT). Simplified reference tissue model (SRTM)-derived binding potential (BPND) using cerebellar gray matter as reference tissue correlated well with plasma input-based distribution volume ratio (DVR). These data suggest that [(18)F]DPA-714 cannot be used for separating individual AD patients from healthy subjects, but further studies including TSPO binding status are needed to substantiate these findings.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25649991/
Double-input compartmental modeling and spectral analysis for the quantification of positron emission tomography data in oncology,"G Tomasi, S Kimberley, L Rosso, E Aboagye, F Turkheimer","In positron emission tomography (PET) studies involving organs different from the brain, ignoring the metabolite contribution to the tissue time-activity curves (TAC), as in the standard single-input (SI) models, may compromise the accuracy of the estimated parameters. We employed here double-input (DI) compartmental modeling (CM), previously used for [¹¹C]thymidine, and a novel DI spectral analysis (SA) approach on the tracers 5-[¹⁸F]fluorouracil (5-[¹⁸F]FU) and [¹⁸F]fluorothymidine ([¹⁸F]FLT). CM and SA were performed initially with a SI approach using the parent plasma TAC as an input function. These methods were then employed using a DI approach with the metabolite plasma TAC as an additional input function. Regions of interest (ROIs) corresponding to healthy liver, kidneys and liver metastases for 5-[¹⁸F]FU and to tumor, vertebra and liver for [¹⁸F]FLT were analyzed. For 5-[¹⁸F]FU, the improvement of the fit quality with the DI approaches was remarkable; in CM, the Akaike information criterion (AIC) always selected the DI over the SI model. Volume of distribution estimates obtained with DI CM and DI SA were in excellent agreement, for both parent 5-[¹⁸F]FU (R(2) = 0.91) and metabolite [¹⁸F]FBAL (R(2) = 0.99). For [¹⁸F]FLT, the DI methods provided notable improvements but less substantial than for 5-[¹⁸F]FU due to the lower rate of metabolism of [¹⁸F]FLT. On the basis of the AIC values, agreement between [¹⁸F]FLT K(i) estimated with the SI and DI models was good (R² = 0.75) for the ROIs where the metabolite contribution was negligible, indicating that the additional input did not bias the parent tracer only-related estimates. When the AIC suggested a substantial contribution of the metabolite [¹⁸F]FLT-glucuronide, on the other hand, the change in the parent tracer only-related parameters was significant (R² = 0.33 for K(i)). Our results indicated that improvements of DI over SI approaches can range from moderate to substantial and are more significant for tracers with a high rate of metabolism. Furthermore, they showed that SA is suitable for DI modeling and can be used effectively in the analysis of PET data.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22421332/
Quantitation of multiple injection dynamic PET scans: an investigation of the benefits of pooling data from separate scans when mapping kinetics,"Fengyun Gu, Finbarr O'Sullivan, Mark Muzi, David A Mankoff","Multiple injection dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) scanning is used in the clinical management of certain groups of patients and in medical research. The analysis of these studies can be approached in two ways: (i) separate analysis of data from individual tracer injections, or (ii), concatenate/pool data from separate injections and carry out a combined analysis. The simplicity of separate analysis has some practical appeal but may not be statistically efficient. We use a linear model framework associated with a kinetic mapping scheme to develop a simplified theoretical understanding of separate and combined analysis. The theoretical framework is explored numerically using both 1D and 2D simulation models. These studies are motivated by the breast cancer flow-metabolism mismatch studies involving15O-water (H2O) and18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and repeat15O-H2O injections used in brain activation investigations. Numerical results are found to be substantially in line with the simple theoretical analysis: mean square error characteristics of alternative methods are well described by factors involving the local voxel-level resolution of the imaging data, the relative activities of the individual scans and the number of separate injections involved. While voxel-level resolution has dependence on scan dose, after adjustment for this effect, the impact of a combined analysis is understood in simple terms associated with the linear model used for kinetic mapping. This is true for both data reconstructed by direct filtered backprojection or iterative maximum likelihood. The proposed analysis has potential to be applied to the emerging long axial field-of-view PET scanners.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34049293/
A pharmacokinetic PET study of NK₁ receptor occupancy,"Stefano Zamuner, Eugenii A Rabiner, Sofia A Fernandes, Massimo Bani, Roger N Gunn, Roberto Gomeni, Emilangelo Ratti, Vincent J Cunningham","Purpose: There is growing recognition of the importance of integrating drug occupancy data acquired by positron emission tomography (PET) with the plasma pharmacokinetics of the drug, in order to establish proper dose selection in subsequent clinical trials. Here we present a study in human subjects of the occupancy of NK(1) receptors achieved following different doses of casopitant, a selective NK(1) antagonist.

Methods: Two PET scans were carried out in each of eight human subjects, with the PET radioligand [(11)C]GR205171, a high-affinity and selective NK(1) receptor antagonist. The first scan was under baseline conditions and the second 24 h after a single oral dose of casopitant (2-120 mg). Arterial blood was collected throughout the scans for determination of plasma and whole blood input functions. Venous blood samples were taken prior to and following oral dosing up to 24 h for a pharmacokinetic study of casopitant concentration in plasma.

Results: It was first necessary to establish a suitable kinetic model for the estimation of [(11)C]GR205171 NK(1) receptor binding parameters in human brain tissue. A three-tissue compartment model with simultaneous estimation of multiple regions sharing common variables across regions was found suitable for the analysis. Because of the injected cold mass of the tracer and the high affinity of [(11)C]GR205171 a correction for tracer occupancy effects was also incorporated into the analysis. We then developed a pharmacokinetic-receptor occupancy (PK-RO) model of the relationship between casopitant plasma concentrations and receptor binding, using a population approach.

Conclusion: These results indicate that after chronic dosing, casopitant can achieve a degree of NK(1) receptor occupancy higher than those that have previously been tested in studies of clinical depression.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21993526/
Imaging of brain hypoxia in permanent and temporary middle cerebral artery occlusion in the rat using 18F-fluoromisonidazole and positron emission tomography: a pilot study,"Masashi Takasawa, John S Beech, Tim D Fryer, Young T Hong, Jessica L Hughes, Keiji Igase, P Simon Jones, Rob Smith, Franklin I Aigbirhio, David K Menon, John C Clark, Jean-Claude Baron","In acute stroke, the target of therapy is the severely hypoxic but salvageable tissue. Previous human studies using 18F-fluoromisonidazole and positron emission tomography (18F-FMISO PET) have shown high tracer retention indicative of tissue hypoxia, which had normalized at repeat scan >48 h later. In the only validation study of 18F-FMISO, using ex vivo autoradiography in thread middle cerebral artery occluded (MCAo) rats, there was unexpected high uptake as late as 22 h after reperfusion, raising questions about the use of 18F-FMISO as a hypoxia tracer. Here we report a pilot study of 18F-FMISO PET in experimental stroke. Spontaneous hypertensive rats were subjected to distal clip MCAo. Three-hour dynamic PET was performed in 7 rats: 3 normals, 1 with permanent MCAo (two sessions: 30 mins and 48 h after clip), and 3 with temporary MCAo (45 mins, n=1; 120 mins, n=2; scanning started 30 mins after clip removal). Experiments were terminated by perfusion-fixation for standard histopathology. Late tracer retention was assessed by both compartmental modelling and simple side-to-side ratios. In the initial PET session of the permanent MCAo rat, striking trapping of 18F-FMISO was observed in the affected cortex, which had normalized 48 h later; histopathology revealed pannecrosis. In contrast, there was no demonstrable tracer retention in either temporary MCAo models, and histopathology showed ischemic changes only. These results document elevated 18F-FMISO uptake in the stroke area only in the early phase of MCAo, but not after early reperfusion nor when tissue necrosis has developed. These findings strongly support the validity of 18F-FMISO as a marker of viable hypoxic tissue/penumbra after stroke.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17033692/
Revisiting the Logan plot to account for non-negligible blood volume in brain tissue,"Martin Schain, Patrik Fazio, Ladislav Mrzljak, Nahid Amini, Nabil Al-Tawil, Cheryl Fitzer-Attas, Juliana Bronzova, Bernhard Landwehrmeyer, Christina Sampaio, Christer Halldin, Andrea Varrone","Background: Reference tissue-based quantification of brain PET data does not typically include correction for signal originating from blood vessels, which is known to result in biased outcome measures. The bias extent depends on the amount of radioactivity in the blood vessels. In this study, we seek to revisit the well-established Logan plot and derive alternative formulations that provide estimation of distribution volume ratios (DVRs) that are corrected for the signal originating from the vasculature.

Results: New expressions for the Logan plot based on arterial input function and reference tissue were derived, which included explicit terms for whole blood radioactivity. The new methods were evaluated using PET data acquired using [11C]raclopride and [18F]MNI-659. The two-tissue compartment model (2TCM), with which signal originating from blood can be explicitly modeled, was used as a gold standard. DVR values obtained for [11C]raclopride using the either blood-based or reference tissue-based Logan plot were systematically underestimated compared to 2TCM, and for [18F]MNI-659, a proportionality bias was observed, i.e., the bias varied across regions. The biases disappeared when optimal blood-signal correction was used for respective tracer, although for the case of [18F]MNI-659 a small but systematic overestimation of DVR was still observed.

Conclusions: The new method appears to remove the bias introduced due to absence of correction for blood volume in regular graphical analysis and can be considered in clinical studies. Further studies are however required to derive a generic mapping between plasma and whole-blood radioactivity levels.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28822101/
Human (13)N-ammonia PET studies: the importance of measuring (13)N-ammonia metabolites in blood,"Susanne Keiding, Michael Sørensen, Ole Lajord Munk, Dirk Bender","Dynamic (13)N-ammonia PET is used to assess ammonia metabolism in brain, liver and muscle based on kinetic modeling of metabolic pathways, using arterial blood (13)N-ammonia as input function. Rosenspire et al. (1990) introduced a solid phase extraction procedure for fractionation of (13)N-content in blood into (13)N-ammonia, (13)N-urea, (13)N-glutamine and (13)N-glutamate. Due to a radioactive half-life for (13)N of 10 min, the procedure is not suitable for blood samples taken beyond 5-7 min after tracer injection. By modifying Rosenspire's method, we established a method enabling analysis of up to 10 blood samples in the course of 30 min. The modified procedure was validated by HPLC and by 30-min reproducibility studies in humans examined by duplicate (13)N-ammonia injections with a 60-min interval. Blood data from a (13)N-ammonia brain PET study (from Keiding et al. 2006) showed: (1) time courses of (13)N-ammonia fractions could be described adequately by double exponential functions; (2) metabolic conversion of (13)N-ammonia to (13)N-metabolites were in the order: healthy subjects > cirrhotic patients without HE > cirrhotic patients with HE; (3) kinetics of initial tracer distribution in tissue can be assessed by using total (13)N-concentration in blood as input function, whereas assessment of metabolic processes requires (13)N-ammonia measurements.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20217201/
18F-Branched-Chain Amino Acids: Structure-Activity Relationships and PET Imaging Potential,"Matthew B Nodwell, Hua Yang, Helen Merkens, Noeen Malik, Milena Čolović, Björn Wagner, Rainer E Martin, François Bénard, Paul Schaffer, Robert Britton","The large, neutral L-type amino acid transporters (LAT1-LAT4) are sodium-independent transporters that are widely distributed throughout the body. LAT expression levels are increased in many types of cancer, and their expression increases as cancers progress, leading to high expression levels in high-grade tumors and metastases. Because of the key role and overexpression of LAT in many types of cancer, radiolabeled LAT substrates are promising candidates for nuclear imaging of malignancies that are not well revealed by conventional radiotracers. The goal of this study was to examine the structure-activity relationships of a series of18F-labeled amino acids that were predicted to be substrates of the LAT transport system.Methods:Using a photocatalytic radical fluorination, we prepared a series of 11 fluorinated branched-chain amino acids and evaluated them and their nonfluorinated parents in a cell-based LAT affinity assay. We radiofluorinated selected branched-chain amino acids via the same radical fluorination reaction and evaluated tumor uptake in U-87 glioma xenograft-bearing mice.Results:Structure-activity relationship trends observed in a LAT affinity assay were maintained in furtherin vitrostudies, as well asin vivousing a U-87 xenograft model. LAT1 uptake was tolerant of fluorinated amino acid stereochemistry and chain length. PET imaging and biodistribution studies showed that the tracer (S)-5-18F-fluorohomoleucine had rapid tumor uptake, favorablein vivokinetics, and good stability.Conclusion:By using anin vitroaffinity assay, we could predict LAT-mediated cancer cell uptake in a panel of fluorinated amino acids.

Impact of contamination with long-lived radionuclides on PET kinetics modelling in multitracer studies,"Lars Jødal, Søren B Hansen, Svend B Jensen","Introduction: An important issue in multitracer studies is the separation of signals from the different radiotracers. This is especially the case when an early tracer has a long physical half-life and kinetic modelling has to be performed, because the early tracer can confer a long-lived contaminating background not only to images but also to a measured input function derived from blood samples. In this study, we examined data from a sequential multitracer infection study involving In (t1/2=2.8 days), investigating the influence on gamma counting of blood samples and on the kinetic modelling of subsequent PET tracers. Blood sample counts were corrected by recounting the samples a few days later. A more optimal choice of energy window was also explored. The effect of correction versus noncorrection was investigated using a two-tissue kinetic model with irreversible uptake (K1, k2, k3).

Results: K1 was least affected and k3 was most affected by the contamination, corresponding to the effect being relatively larger on the late part of the blood input function. A narrower energy window reduced the problem, but this will not be possible for all types of contaminating background.

Conclusion: Gamma counting of blood samples can lead to a contaminating background not observed in PET imaging and this background can affect kinetic modelling. If the contaminating tracer has a much longer half-life than the foreground tracer, then the problem can be solved by late recounting of the samples.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27092664/

Positron emission tomography displacement sensitivity: predicting binding potential change for positron emission tomography tracers based on their kinetic characteristics,"Evan D Morris, Karmen K Yoder","There is great interest in positron emission tomography (PET) as a noninvasive assay of fluctuations in synaptic neurotransmitter levels, but questions remain regarding the optimal choice of tracer for such a task. A mathematical method is proposed for predicting the utility of any PET tracer as a detector of changes in the concentration of an endogenous competitor via displacement of the tracer (a.k.a., its 'vulnerability' to competition). The method is based on earlier theoretical work by Endres and Carson and by the authors. A tracer-specific predictor, the PET Displacement Sensitivity (PDS), is calculated from compartmental model simulations of the uptake and retention of dopaminergic radiotracers in the presence of transient elevations of dopamine (DA). The PDS predicts the change in binding potential (DeltaBP) for a given change in receptor occupancy because of binding by the endogenous competitor. Simulations were performed using estimates of tracer kinetic parameters derived from the literature. For D(2)/D(3) tracers, the calculated PDS indices suggest a rank order for sensitivity to displacement by DA as follows: raclopride (highest sensitivity), followed by fallypride, FESP, FLB, NMSP, and epidepride (lowest). Although the PDS takes into account the affinity constant for the tracer at the binding site, its predictive value cannot be matched by either a single equilibrium constant, or by any one rate constant of the model. Values for DeltaBP have been derived from published studies that employed comparable displacement paradigms with amphetamine and a D(2)/D(3) tracer. The values are in good agreement with the PDS-predicted rank order of sensitivity to displacement.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16788713/
"PET imaging of focal demyelination and remyelination in a rat model of multiple sclerosis: comparison of [11C]MeDAS, [11C]CIC and [11C]PIB","Daniele de Paula Faria, Sjef Copray, Jurgen W A Sijbesma, Antoon T M Willemsen, Carlos A Buchpiguel, Rudi A J O Dierckx, Erik F J de Vries","Purpose: In this study, we compared the ability of [(11)C]CIC, [(11)C]MeDAS and [(11)C]PIB to reveal temporal changes in myelin content in focal lesions in the lysolecithin rat model of multiple sclerosis. Pharmacokinetic modelling was performed to determine the best method to quantify tracer uptake.

Methods: Sprague-Dawley rats were stereotactically injected with either 1 % lysolecithin or saline into the corpus callosum and striatum of the right brain hemisphere. Dynamic PET imaging with simultaneous arterial blood sampling was performed 7 days after saline injection (control group), 7 days after lysolecithin injection (demyelination group) and 4 weeks after lysolecithin injection (remyelination group).

Results: The kinetics of [(11)C]CIC, [(11)C]MeDAS and [(11)C]PIB was best fitted by Logan graphical analysis, suggesting that tracer binding is reversible. Compartment modelling revealed that all tracers were fitted best with the reversible two-tissue compartment model. Tracer uptake and distribution volume in lesions were in agreement with myelin status. However, the slow kinetics and homogeneous brain uptake of [(11)C]CIC make this tracer less suitable for in vivo PET imaging. [(11)C]PIB showed good uptake in the white matter in the cerebrum, but [(11)C]PIB uptake in the cerebellum was low, despite high myelin density in this region. [(11)C]MeDAS distribution correlated well with myelin density in different brain regions.

Conclusion: This study showed that PET imaging of demyelination and remyelination processes in focal lesions is feasible. Our comparison of three myelin tracers showed that [(11)C]MeDAS has more favourable properties for quantitative PET imaging of demyelinated and remyelinated lesions throughout the CNS than [(11)C]CIC and [(11)C]PIB.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24499866/
Determination of regional flow by use of intravascular PET tracers: microvascular theory and experimental validation for pig livers,"Ole Lajord Munk, Ludvik Bass, Howard Feng, Susanne Keiding","Today, the standard approach for the kinetic analysis of dynamic PET studies is compartment models, in which the tracer and its metabolites are confined to a few well-mixed compartments. We examine whether the standard model is suitable for modern PET data or whether theories including more physiologic realism can advance the interpretation of dynamic PET data. A more detailed microvascular theory is developed for intravascular tracers in single-capillary and multiple-capillary systems. The microvascular models, which account for concentration gradients in capillaries, are validated and compared with the standard model in a pig liver study.

Methods: Eight pigs underwent a 5-min dynamic PET study after (15)O-carbon monoxide inhalation. Throughout each experiment, hepatic arterial blood and portal venous blood were sampled, and flow was measured with transit-time flow meters. The hepatic dual-inlet concentration was calculated as the flow-weighted inlet concentration. Dynamic PET data were analyzed with a traditional single-compartment model and 2 microvascular models.

Results: Microvascular models provided a better fit of the tissue activity of an intravascular tracer than did the compartment model. In particular, the early dynamic phase after a tracer bolus injection was much improved. The regional hepatic blood flow estimates provided by the microvascular models (1.3 +/- 0.3 mL min(-1) mL(-1) for the single-capillary model and 1.14 +/- 0.14 min(-1) mL(-1) for the multiple-capillary model) (mean +/- SEM mL of blood min(-1) mL of liver tissue(-1)) were in agreement with the total blood flow measured by flow meters and normalized to liver weight (1.03 +/- 0.12 mL min(-1) mL(-1)).

Conclusion: Compared with the standard compartment model, the 2 microvascular models provide a superior description of tissue activity after an intravascular tracer bolus injection. The microvascular models include only parameters with a clear-cut physiologic interpretation and are applicable to capillary beds in any organ. In this study, the microvascular models were validated for the liver and provided quantitative regional flow estimates in agreement with flow measurements.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14602871/
An in vitro assay for predicting successful imaging radiotracers,"Shil Patel, Terence Hamill, Eric Hostetler, H Donald Burns, Raymond E Gibson","Purpose: To develop an in vitro binding assay able to predict whether a radiolabel is likely to be a useful clinical tracer for positron emission tomography (PET).

Procedures: Rodent and rhesus brain sections were incubated with radioligands, most of which are tritiated or iodinated versions of known clinical PET radiotracers, and assayed for binding to brain receptors for a 20-minute period using a no-wash protocol (n=>/=3).

Results: Radiolabeled flumazenil (RO-151788), WAY100635, N-methylscopolamine, N-methylspiperone, raclopride, citalopram, (1-)2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl-2-aminopropane (DOI), paroxetine, and 4-(2'-methoxyphenyl)-1-[2'-[N-(2""-pyridinyl)-p-flurobenzamido]ethyl]piperazine (MPPF) were assessed for binding to either rhesus caudate putamen, and/or frontal cortex, or rat whole brain sections. Specific binding for these compounds ranged from 0 to 94% by 20 minutes. Those with %-specific binding less than 10% have also been shown to not be effective as in vivo PET radiotracers. In addition, successful PET radiotracers incubated in tissue sections with target receptor either absent or present in low density behaved poorly in this assay, as expected, as did radiolabels previously shown to possess high non-specific binding.

Conclusions: An in vitro binding assay using rodent and rhesus brain sections has been developed that, within the currently assayed radiotracers, is able to rapidly predict whether a radiolabeled compound is a useful clinical PET radiotracer. This method suggests significant potential for the rapid in vitro evaluation of potential in vivo PET radiotracers.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14499146/
A robust state-space kinetics-guided framework for dynamic PET image reconstruction,"S Tong, A M Alessio, P E Kinahan, H Liu, P Shi","Dynamic PET image reconstruction is a challenging issue due to the low SNR and the large quantity of spatio-temporal data. We propose a robust state-space image reconstruction (SSIR) framework for activity reconstruction in dynamic PET. Unlike statistically-based frame-by-frame methods, tracer kinetic modeling is incorporated to provide physiological guidance for the reconstruction, harnessing the temporal information of the dynamic data. Dynamic reconstruction is formulated in a state-space representation, where a compartmental model describes the kinetic processes in a continuous-time system equation, and the imaging data are expressed in a discrete measurement equation. Tracer activity concentrations are treated as the state variables, and are estimated from the dynamic data. Sampled-data H(∞) filtering is adopted for robust estimation. H(∞) filtering makes no assumptions on the system and measurement statistics, and guarantees bounded estimation error for finite-energy disturbances, leading to robust performance for dynamic data with low SNR and/or errors. This alternative reconstruction approach could help us to deal with unpredictable situations in imaging (e.g. data corruption from failed detector blocks) or inaccurate noise models. Experiments on synthetic phantom and patient PET data are performed to demonstrate feasibility of the SSIR framework, and to explore its potential advantages over frame-by-frame statistical reconstruction approaches.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21441650/
ntPET: a new application of PET imaging for characterizing the kinetics of endogenous neurotransmitter release,"Evan D Morris, Karmen K Yoder, Chunzhi Wang, Marc D Normandin, Qi-Huang Zheng, Bruce Mock, Raymond F Muzic Jr, Janice C Froehlich","We present a new application of positron emission tomography (""ntPET"" or ""neurotransmitter PET"") designed to recover temporal patterns of neurotransmitter release from dynamic data. Our approach employs an enhanced tracer kinetic model that describes uptake of a labeled dopamine D2/D3 receptor ligand in the presence of a time-varying rise and fall in endogenous dopamine. Data must be acquired during both baseline and stimulus (transient dopamine release) conditions. Data from a reference region in both conditions are used as an input function, which alleviates the need for any arterial blood sampling. We use simulation studies to demonstrate the ability of the method to recover the temporal characteristics of an increase in dopamine concentration that might be expected following a drug treatment. The accuracy and precision of the method-as well as its potential for false-positive responses due to noise or changes in blood flow-were examined. Finally, we applied the ntPET method to small-animal imaging data in order to produce the first noninvasive assay of the time-varying release of dopamine in the rat striatum following alcohol.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16285909/
P2X 7-receptor binding in new-onset and secondary progressive MS - a [11C]SMW139 PET study,"Jussi Lehto, Richard Aarnio, Jouni Tuisku, Marcus Sucksdorff, Esa Mikko Koivumäki, Marjo Nylund, Semi Helin, Johan Rajander, Jonathan Danon, Jayson Gilchrist, Michael Kassiou, Vesa Oikonen, Laura Airas","Background: PET imaging of activated microglia has improved our understanding of the pathology behind disability progression in MS, and pro-inflammatory microglia at 'smoldering' lesion rims have been implicated as drivers of disability progression. The P2X7R is upregulated in the cellular membranes of activated microglia. A single-tissue dual-input model was applied to quantify P2X7R binding in the normal appearing white matter, perilesional areas and thalamus among progressive MS patients, healthy controls and newly diagnosed relapsing MS patients.

Results: Overall, tracer uptake in the MS brain was not significantly higher compared to HCs. In the 3 mm perilesional rim of all T1 lesions, tracer binding was higher among relapsing patients compared to progressive patients. Tracer binding was higher in males compared to females. Disease duration correlated with tracer binding in the normal appearing white matter. Age correlated negatively with tracer binding in the perilesional rims.

Conclusions: Even as binding estimates obtained with the dual-input model were consistent with the expected distribution of P2X7Rs in the MS brain, the small free fraction of the parent tracer may limit its accuracy and applicability, and binding estimates between subjects were highly variable. Conclusive evidence for the applicability of [11C]SMW139 to detect MS-related diffuse smoldering inflammation was not obtained.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39636350/
"The use of spectral analysis to determine regional cerebral glucose utilization with positron emission tomography and [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose: theory, implementation, and optimization procedures","F Turkheimer, R M Moresco, G Lucignani, L Sokoloff, F Fazio, K Schmidt","A method for kinetic analysis of dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) data by linear programming that allows identification of the components of a measured PET signal without predefining a compartmental model has recently been proposed by Cunningham and co-workers. The method identifies a small subset of functions from a large input set of feasible functions that best fits the time course of total radioactivity measured by PET. To investigate in detail the properties of this technique, we applied it to PET studies with [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose, a tracer with well-characterized kinetic properties. We examined dynamically acquired data over various time intervals in many brain regions and found that the number of components identified by the method is stable and consistent with the presence of kinetic heterogeneity in every region. We optimized the method for determination of regional rates of glucose utilization; calculated rates were found to be somewhat dependent upon the treatment of noise in the measured tissue data and upon the time interval in which the data were collected. The application of a numerical filter to remove noise in the data resulted in values for regional cerebral glucose utilization that were stable with time and consistent with rates determined by the other established techniques. Based on the results of the current study, we expect that the spectral analysis technique will prove to be a highly flexible tool for kinetic analysis of other tracer compounds; it is capable of producing low-variance, time-stable estimates of physiological parameters when optimized for time interval of application, input spectrum of components, and processing of noise in the data.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8163583/
5-Hydroxy-L-[beta-11C]tryptophan versus alpha-[11C]methyl-L-tryptophan for positron emission tomography imaging of serotonin synthesis capacity in the rhesus monkey brain,"Pinelopi Lundquist, Per Hartvig, Gunnar Blomquist, Margareta Hammarlund-Udenaes, Bengt Långström","The purpose of this study was to compare two positron emission tomography (PET) tracers that were developed to follow serotonin (5HT) synthesis by performing sequential PET scanning of the same rhesus monkey (n=4) on the same day. alpha-[11C]Methyl-L-tryptophan ([11C]AMT) and 5-Hydroxy-L-[beta-11C]tryptophan ([11C]HTP) are substrates in the first and second enzymatic steps, respectively, in the biosynthesis of 5HT. Regional net accumulation rate constants were derived from kinetic (two-tissue compartment model with irreversible tracer trapping) and graphic (Patlak) analyses, using the arterial plasma concentrations as input. The kinetic data analysis showed that the rate constant for the transfer of [11C]HTP into the brain (K1) was higher than that for [11C]AMT in the striatum and thalamus but was similar in other brain regions. The rate constant for tracer trapping (k3) was also higher for [11C]HTP than for [11C]AMT in the striatum (0.046+/-0.024 versus 0.019+/-0.006 min(-1)) and thalamus (0.039+/-0.013 versus 0.016+/-0.007 min(-1)). In agreement with previously reported regional HTP accumulation rates, the net accumulation rate constant (K(acc)) for [11C]HTP was also higher in these regions than in other brain regions; this is in contrast to the uniform distribution of [11C]AMT K(acc) values. This suggests that the regional net accumulation rates obtained with these two PET tracers will be of different magnitude, which might be related to the activity of each targeted enzyme.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16896348/
Small-animal PET study of adenosine A(1) receptors in rat brain: blocking receptors and raising extracellular adenosine,"Soumen Paul, Shivashankar Khanapur, Anna A Rybczynska, Chantal Kwizera, Jurgen W A Sijbesma, Kiichi Ishiwata, Antoon T M Willemsen, Philip H Elsinga, Rudi A J O Dierckx, Aren van Waarde","Activation of adenosine A(1) receptors (A(1)R) in the brain causes sedation, reduces anxiety, inhibits seizures, and promotes neuroprotection. Cerebral A(1)R can be visualized using 8-dicyclopropylmethyl-1-(11)C-methyl-3-propyl-xanthine ((11)C-MPDX) and PET. This study aims to test whether (11)C-MPDX can be used for quantitative studies of cerebral A(1)R in rodents.

Methods: (11)C-MPDX was injected (intravenously) into isoflurane-anesthetized male Wistar rats (300 g). A dynamic scan of the central nervous system was obtained, using a small-animal PET camera. A cannula in a femoral artery was used for blood sampling. Three groups of animals were studied: group 1, controls (saline-treated); group 2, animals pretreated with the A(1)R antagonist 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (DPCPX, 1 mg, intraperitoneally); and group 3, animals pretreated (intraperitoneally) with a 20% solution of ethanol in saline (2 mL) plus the adenosine kinase inhibitor 4-amino-5-(3-bromophenyl)-7-(6-morpholino-pyridin-3-yl)pyrido[2,3-d] pyrimidine dihydrochloride (ABT-702) (1 mg). DPCPX is known to occupy cerebral A(1)R, whereas ethanol and ABT-702 increase extracellular adenosine.

Results: In groups 1 and 3, the brain was clearly visualized. High uptake of (11)C-MPDX was noted in striatum, hippocampus, and cerebellum. In group 2, tracer uptake was strongly suppressed and regional differences were abolished. The treatment of group 3 resulted in an unexpected 40%-45% increase of the cerebral uptake of radioactivity as indicated by increases of PET standardized uptake value, distribution volume from Logan plot, nondisplaceable binding potential from 2-tissue-compartment model fit, and standardized uptake value from a biodistribution study performed after the PET scan. The partition coefficient of the tracer (K(1)/k(2) from the model fit) was not altered under the study conditions.

Conclusion: (11)C-MPDX shows a regional distribution in rat brain consistent with binding to A(1)R. Tracer binding is blocked by the selective A(1)R antagonist DPCPX. Pretreatment of animals with ethanol and adenosine kinase inhibitor increases (11)C-MPDX uptake. This increase may reflect an increased availability of A(1)R after acute exposure to ethanol.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21764782/
"A first-in-man PET study of [18F]PSS232, a fluorinated ABP688 derivative for imaging metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5","Geoffrey Warnock, Michael Sommerauer, Linjing Mu, Gloria Pla Gonzalez, Susanne Geistlich, Valerie Treyer, Roger Schibli, Alfred Buck, Stefanie D Krämer, Simon M Ametamey","Purpose: Non-invasive imaging of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGlu5) in the brain using PET is of interest in e.g., anxiety, depression, and Parkinson's disease. Widespread application of the most widely used mGlu5tracer, [11C]ABP688, is limited by the short physical half-life of carbon-11. [18F]PSS232 is a fluorinated analog with promising preclinical properties and high selectivity and specificity for mGlu5. In this first-in-man study, we evaluated the brain uptake pattern and kinetics of [18F]PSS232 in healthy volunteers.

Methods: [18F]PSS232 PET was performed with ten healthy male volunteers aged 20-40 years. Seven of the subjects received a bolus injection and the remainder a bolus/infusion protocol. Cerebral blood flow was determined in seven subjects using [15O]water PET. Arterial blood activity was measured using an online blood counter. Tracer kinetics were evaluated by compartment modeling and parametric maps were generated for both tracers.

Results: At 90 min post-injection, 59.2 ± 11.1% of total radioactivity in plasma corresponded to intact tracer. The regional first pass extraction fraction of [18F]PSS232 ranged from 0.41 ± 0.06 to 0.55 ± 0.03 and brain distribution pattern matched that of [11C]ABP688. Uptake kinetics followed a simple two-tissue compartment model. The volume of distribution of total tracer (VT, ml/cm3) ranged from 1.18 ± 0.20 for white matter to 2.91 ± 0.51 for putamen. The respective mean distribution volume ratios (DVR) with cerebellum as the reference tissue were 0.88 ± 0.06 and 2.12 ± 0.10, respectively. The tissue/cerebellum ratios of a bolus/infusion protocol (30/70 dose ratio) were close to the DVR values.

Conclusions: Brain uptake of [18F]PSS232 matched the distribution of mGlu5and followed a two-tissue compartment model. The well-defined kinetics and the possibility to use reference tissue models, obviating the need for arterial blood sampling, make [18F]PSS232 a promising fluorine-18 labeled radioligand for measuring mGlu5density in humans.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29177707/
Analysis of penalized likelihood image reconstruction for dynamic PET quantification,"Guobao Wang, Jinyi Qi","Quantification of tracer kinetics using dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) provides important information for understanding the physiological and biochemical processes in humans and animals. A common procedure is to reconstruct a sequence of dynamic images first, and then apply kinetic analysis to the time activity curve of a region of interest derived from the reconstructed images. Obviously, the choice of image reconstruction method and its parameters affect the accuracy of the time activity curve and hence the estimated kinetic parameters. This paper analyzes the effects of penalized likelihood image reconstruction on tracer kinetic parameter estimation. Approximate theoretical expressions are derived to study the bias, variance, and ensemble mean squared error of the estimated kinetic parameters. Computer simulations show that these formulae predict correctly the changes of these statistics as functions of the regularization parameter. It is found that the choice of the regularization parameter has a significant impact on kinetic parameter estimation, indicating proper selection of image reconstruction parameters is important for dynamic PET. A practical method has been developed to use the theoretical formulae to guide the selection of the regularization parameter in dynamic PET image reconstruction.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19211345/
Nonlinear spatio-temporal filtering of dynamic PET data using a four-dimensional Gaussian filter and expectation-maximization deconvolution,"J M Floberg, J E Holden","We introduce a method for denoising dynamic PET data, spatio-temporal expectation-maximization (STEM) filtering, that combines four-dimensional Gaussian filtering withEMdeconvolution. The initial Gaussian filter suppresses noise at a broad range of spatial and temporal frequencies and EM deconvolution quickly restores the frequencies most important to the signal. We aim to demonstrate that STEM filtering can improve variance in both individual time frames and in parametric images without introducing significant bias. We evaluate STEM filtering with a dynamic phantom study, and with simulated and human dynamic PET studies of a tracer with reversible binding behaviour, [C-11]raclopride, and a tracer with irreversible binding behaviour, [F-18]FDOPA. STEM filtering is compared to a number of established three and four-dimensional denoising methods. STEM filtering provides substantial improvements in variance in both individual time frames and in parametric images generated with a number of kinetic analysis techniques while introducing little bias. STEM filtering does bias early frames, but this does not affect quantitative parameter estimates. STEM filtering is shown to be superior to the other simple denoising methods studied. STEM filtering is a simple and effective denoising method that could be valuable for a wide range of dynamic PET applications.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23370699/
In Vivo Evaluation of 11C-DASB for Quantitative SERT Imaging in Rats and Mice,"Michael Walker, Walter Ehrlichmann, Anke Stahlschmidt, Bernd J Pichler, Kristina Fischer","Serotonin, or 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), plays a key role in the central nervous system and is involved in many essential neurologic processes such as mood, social behavior, and sleep. The serotonin transporter ligand (11)C-3-amino-4(2-dimethylaminomethyl-phenylsufanyl)-benzonitrile ((11)C-DASB) has been used to determine nondisplaceable binding potential (BPND), which is defined as the quotient of the available receptor density (Bavail) and the apparent equilibrium dissociation rate constant (1/appKD) under in vivo conditions. Because of the increasing number of animal models of human diseases, there is a pressing need to evaluate the applicability of (11)C-DASB to rats and mice. Here, we assessed the feasibility of using (11)C-DASB for quantification of serotonin transporter (SERT) density and affinity in vivo in rats and mice.

Methods: Rats and mice underwent 4 PET scans with increasing doses of the unlabeled ligand to calculate Bavail and appKD using the multiple-ligand concentration transporter assay. An additional PET scan was performed to calculate test-retest reproducibility and reliability. BPND was calculated using the simplified reference tissue model, and the results for different reference regions were compared.

Results: Displaceable binding of (11)C-DASB was found in all brain regions of both rats and mice, with the highest binding being in the thalamus and the lowest in the cerebellum. In rats, displaceable binding was largely reduced in the cerebellar cortex, which in mice was spatially indistinguishable from cerebellar white matter. Use of the cerebellum with fully saturated binding sites as the reference region did not lead to reliable results. Test-retest reproducibility in the thalamus was more than 90% in both mice and rats. In rats, Bavail, appKD, and ED50 were 3.9 ± 0.4 pmol/mL, 2.2 ± 0.4 nM, and 12.0 ± 2.6 nmol/kg, respectively, whereas analysis of the mouse measurements resulted in inaccurate fits due to the high injected tracer mass.

Conclusion: Our data showed that in rats, (11)C-DASB can be used to quantify SERT density with good reproducibility. BPND agreed with the distribution of SERT in the rat brain. It remains difficult to estimate quantitative parameters accurately from mouse measurements because of the high injected tracer mass and underestimation of the binding parameters due to high displaceable binding in the reference region.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26514178/
Brain perfusion estimation by Tikhonov model-free deconvolution in a long axial field of view PET/CT scanner exploring five different PET tracers,"Henrik Bo Wiberg Larsson, Ian Law, Thomas L Andersen, Flemming L Andersen, Barbara M Fischer, Mark B Vestergaard, Tanne S W Larsson, Ulrich Lindberg","Purpose: New total-body PET scanners with a long axial field of view (LAFOV) allow for higher temporal resolution due to higher sensitivity, which facilitates perfusion estimation by model-free deconvolution. Fundamental tracer kinetic theory predicts that perfusion can be estimated for all tracers despite their different fates given sufficiently high temporal resolution of 1 s or better, bypassing the need for compartment modelling. The aim of this study was to investigate whether brain perfusion could be estimated using model-free Tikhonov generalized deconvolution for five different PET tracers, [15O]H2O, [11C]PIB, [18F]FE-PE2I, [18F]FDG and [18F]FET. To our knowledge, this is the first example of a general model-free approach to estimate cerebral blood flow (CBF) from PET data.

Methods: Twenty-five patients underwent dynamic LAFOV PET scanning (Siemens, Quadra). PET images were reconstructed with an isotropic voxel resolution of 1.65 mm3. Time framing was 40 × 1 s during bolus passage followed by increasing framing up to 60 min. AIF was obtained from the descending aorta. Both voxel- and region-based calculations of perfusion in the thalamus were performed using the Tikhonov method. The residue impulse response function was used to estimate the extraction fraction of tracer leakage across the blood-brain barrier.

Results: CBF ranged from 37 to 69 mL blood min-1100 mL of tissue-1in the thalamus. Voxelwise calculation of CBF resulted in CBF maps in the physiologically normal range. The extraction fractions of [15O]H2O, [18F]FE-PE2I, [11C]PIB, [18F]FDG and [18F]FET in the thalamus were 0.95, 0.78, 0.62, 0.19 and 0.03, respectively.

Conclusion: The high temporal resolution and sensitivity associated with LAFOV PET scanners allow for noninvasive perfusion estimation of multiple tracers. The method provides an estimation of the residue impulse response function, from which the fate of the tracer can be studied, including the extraction fraction, influx constant, volume of distribution and transit time distribution, providing detailed physiological insight into normal and pathologic tissue.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37843600/
Kinetic analysis of the translocator protein positron emission tomography ligand [18F]GE-180 in the human brain,"Claire Feeney, Gregory Scott, Joel Raffel, S Roberts, Christopher Coello, Amy Jolly, Graham Searle, A P Goldstone, David J Brooks, Richard S Nicholas, William Trigg, Roger N Gunn, David J Sharp","Purpose: PET can image neuroinflammation by targeting the translocator protein (TSPO), which is upregulated in activated microglia. The high nonspecific binding of the first-generation TSPO radioligand [11C]PK-11195 limits accurate quantification. [18F]GE-180, a novel TSPO ligand, displays superior binding to [11C]PK-11195 in vitro. Our objectives were to: (1) evaluate tracer characteristics of [18F]GE-180 in the brains of healthy human subjects; and (2) investigate whether the TSPO Ala147Thr polymorphism influences outcome measures.

Methods: Ten volunteers (five high-affinity binders, HABs, and five mixed-affinity binders, MABs) underwent a dynamic PET scan with arterial sampling after injection of [18F]GE-180. Kinetic modelling of time-activity curves with one-tissue and two-tissue compartment models and Logan graphical analysis was applied to the data. The primary outcome measure was the total volume of distribution (VT) across various regions of interest (ROIs). Secondary outcome measures were the standardized uptake values (SUV), the distribution volume and SUV ratios estimated using a pseudoreference region.

Results: The two-tissue compartment model was the best model. The average regional delivery rate constant (K1) was 0.01 mL cm-3min-1indicating low extraction across the blood-brain barrier (1 %). The estimated median VTacross all ROIs was also low, ranging from 0.16 mL cm-3in the striatum to 0.38 mL cm-3in the thalamus. There were no significant differences in VTbetween HABs and MABs across all ROIs.

Conclusion: A reversible two-tissue compartment model fitted the data well and determined that the tracer has a low first-pass extraction (approximately 1 %) and low VTestimates in healthy individuals. There was no observable dependency on the rs6971 polymorphism as compared to other second-generation TSPO PET tracers. Investigation of [18F]GE-180 in populations with neuroinflammatory disease is needed to determine its suitability for quantitative assessment of TSPO expression.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27349244/
Reference and target region modeling of [11C]-(R)-PK11195 brain studies,"Federico E Turkheimer, Paul Edison, Nicola Pavese, Federico Roncaroli, Alexander N Anderson, Alexander Hammers, Alexander Gerhard, Rainer Hinz, Yan F Tai, David J Brooks","PET with [(11)C]-(R)-PK11195 is currently the modality of choice for the in vivo imaging of microglial activation in the human brain. In this work we devised a supervised clustering procedure and a new quantification methodology capable of producing binding potential (BP) estimates quantitatively comparable with those derived from plasma input with robust quantitative implementation at the pixel level.

Methods: The new methodology uses predefined kinetic classes to extract a gray matter reference tissue without specific tracer binding and devoid of spurious signals (in particular, blood pool and muscle). Kinetic classes were derived from an historical database of 12 healthy control subjects and from 3 patients with Huntington's disease. BP estimates were obtained using rank-shaping exponential spectral analysis (RS-ESA) (both plasma and reference input) and the simplified reference tissue model (SRTM). Comparison between plasma- derived BPs and those produced with the new reference methodology was performed using 6 additional healthy control subjects. Reliability of the new methodology was performed on 4 test-retest studies of patients with Alzheimer's disease.

Results: The new algorithm selected reference voxels in gray matter tissue avoiding regions with specific binding located, in particular, in the venous and arterial circulation. Using the new reference, BP values obtained using a plasma input and a reference input were in excellent agreement and highly correlated (r = 0.811, P < 10(-5)) when calculated with RS-ESA and less so (r = 0.507, P < 0.005) when SRTM was used. In the production of parametric maps, SRTM was used with the new reference extraction, resulting in test-retest variability (10.6%; mean ICC = 0.878) that was superior to that obtained using the previous unsupervised clustering approach (mean ICC = 0.596).

Conclusion: Reference region modeling combined with supervised reference tissue extraction produces a robust and reproducible quantitative assessment of [(11)C]-(R)-PK11195 studies in the human brain.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17204713/
Positron emission tomography with [11C]deuterium-deprenyl in temporal lobe epilepsy,"E Kumlien, M Bergström, A Lilja, J Andersson, V Szekeres, C E Westerberg, G Westerberg, G Antoni, B Långström","We performed positron emission tomography (PET) with [11C]deuterium-deprenyl in 9 patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) undergoing evaluation for possible epilepsy surgery. Seven patients had unilateral and 2 had bilateral mesiotemporal epileptic foci based on the preoperative investigation including ictal EEG discharges and PET with 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG). Deprenyl is an irreversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase type B (MAO-B) with a very high affinity for the enzyme. In the brain, MAO-B is preferentially located in astrocytes, and a previous in vitro study showed increased binding of the ligand in sclerotic hippocampi. Dynamically acquired N-[methyl-11C]-a,a-di-deutero-L-deprenyl distribution in PET images were analyzed graphically, and the focus regions were assessed visually on the PET images. In addition, the accumulation rate and distribution volume of the tracer relative to the cerebellar cortex were measured in standardized homologous temporal regions by semiquantitative methods. Uptake of [11C]deuterium-deprenyl was significantly increased in the epileptogenic temporal lobes, both apparently and semiquantitatively. By calculating mean interlobar ratios, we identified the temporal lobe containing the epileptic focus in six unilateral cases. One case was ambiguous but was not falsely localized. The two bilateral cases were correctly identified as such. Our results suggest that PET with [11C]deuterium-deprenyl might be a useful method for identification of epileptogenic temporal lobes.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7555990/
In vivo assessment and dosimetry of 2 novel PDE10A PET radiotracers in humans: 18F-MNI-659 and 18F-MNI-654,"Olivier Barret, David Thomae, Adriana Tavares, David Alagille, Caroline Papin, Rikki Waterhouse, Timothy McCarthy, Danna Jennings, Ken Marek, David Russell, John Seibyl, Gilles Tamagnan","Phosphodiesterase (PDE) 10A is an enzyme involved in the regulation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate and cyclic guanosine monophosphate and is highly expressed in medium-sized spiny neurons of the striatum, making it an attractive target for novel therapies for a variety of neurologic and psychiatric disorders that involve striatal function. Potential ligands for PET imaging of PDE10A have been reported. Here, we report the first-in-human characterization of 2 new PDE10A radioligands, 2-(2-(3-(1-(2-fluoroethyl)-1H-indazol-6-yl)-7-methyl-4-oxo-3,4-dihydroquinazolin-2-yl)ethyl)-4-isopropoxyisoindoline-1,3-dione ((18)F-MNI-654) and 2-(2-(3-(4-(2-fluoroethoxy)phenyl)-7-methyl-4-oxo-3,4-dihydroquinazolin-2-yl)ethyl)-4-isopropoxyisoindoline-1,3-dione ((18)F-MNI-659), with the goal of selecting the best one for use in future studies interrogating pathophysiologic changes in neuropsychiatric disorders and aiding pharmaceutical development targeting PDE10A.

Methods: Eleven healthy volunteers participated in this study ((18)F-MNI-654 test-retest, 2 men; (18)F-MNI-659 test-retest, 4 men and 1 woman; (18)F-MNI-659 dosimetry, 2 men and 2 women). Brain PET images were acquired over 5.5 h for (18)F-MNI-654 and over 3.5 h for (18)F-MNI-659, and pharmacokinetic modeling with plasma- and reference-region (cerebellar cortex)-based methods was performed. Whole-body PET images were acquired over 6 h for (18)F-MNI-659 and radiation dosimetry estimated with OLINDA.

Results: Both radiotracers were similarly metabolized, with about 20% of intact parent remaining at 120 min after injection. PET time-activity data demonstrated that (18)F-MNI-654 kinetics were much slower than (18)F-MNI-659 kinetics. For (18)F-MNI-659, there was good agreement between the Logan and simplified reference tissue models for nondisplaceable binding potential (BPND), supporting noninvasive quantification, with test-retest variability less than 10% and intraclass correlation greater than 0.9. The (18)F-MNI-659 effective dose was estimated at 0.024 mSv/MBq.

Conclusion: PET imaging in the human brain with 2 novel PDE10A (18)F tracers is being reported. Noninvasive quantification of (18)F-MNI-659 with the simplified reference tissue model using the cerebellum as a reference is possible. In addition, (18)F-MNI-659 kinetics are fast enough for a good estimate of BPND with 90 min of data, with values around 3.0 in the basal ganglia. Finally, (18)F-MNI-659 dosimetry is favorable and consistent with values reported for other PET radiotracers currently used in humans.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24898025/
Estimating neurotransmitter kinetics with ntPET: a simulation study of temporal precision and effects of biased data,"Marc D Normandin, Evan D Morris","We recently introduced neurotransmitter PET (ntPET), an analysis technique that estimates the kinetics of stimulus-induced neurotransmitter (NT) release. Here, we evaluate two formulations of ntPET. The arterial (ART) approach measures the tracer input function (TIF) directly. The reference (REF) approach derives the TIF from reference region data. Arterial sampling is considered the gold standard in PET modeling but reference region approaches are preferred for reduced cost and complexity. If simulated PET data with unbiased TIFs were analyzed using ART or REF, temporal precision was better than 3 min provided NT concentration peaked less than 30 min into the scanning session. The consequences of biased TIFs or stimulus-induced changes in tracer delivery were also evaluated. ART TIFs were biased by the presence of uncorrected radiometabolites in the plasma whereas REF TIFs were biased by specific binding in the reference region. Simulated changes in tracer delivery emulated ethanol-induced blood flow alterations observed previously with PET. ART performance deteriorated significantly if metabolites amounted to 50% of plasma radioactivity by 60 min. The accuracy and precision of REF were preserved even if the reference region contained 40% of the receptor density of the target region. Both methods were insensitive to blood flow alterations (proportional changes in K(1) and k(2)). Our results suggest that PET data contain information--heretofore not extracted--about the timing of NT release. The REF formulation of ntPET proved to be robust to many plausible model violations and under most circumstances is an appropriate alternative to ART.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18023364/
Measurement of longitudinal β-amyloid change with 18F-florbetapir PET and standardized uptake value ratios,"Susan M Landau, Allison Fero, Suzanne L Baker, Robert Koeppe, Mark Mintun, Kewei Chen, Eric M Reiman, William J Jagust","The accurate measurement of β-amyloid (Aβ) change using amyloid PET imaging is important for Alzheimer disease research and clinical trials but poses several unique challenges. In particular, reference region measurement instability may lead to spurious changes in cortical regions of interest. To optimize our ability to measure (18)F-florbetapir longitudinal change, we evaluated several candidate regions of interest and their influence on cortical florbetapir change over a 2-y period in participants from the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI).

Methods: We examined the agreement in cortical florbetapir change detected using 6 candidate reference regions (cerebellar gray matter, whole cerebellum, brain stem/pons, eroded subcortical white matter [WM], and 2 additional combinations of these regions) in 520 ADNI subjects. We used concurrent cerebrospinal fluid Aβ1-42 measurements to identify subgroups of ADNI subjects expected to remain stable over follow-up (stable Aβ group; n = 14) and subjects expected to increase (increasing Aβ group; n = 91). We then evaluated reference regions according to whether cortical change was minimal in the stable Aβ group and cortical retention increased in the increasing Aβ group.

Results: There was poor agreement across reference regions in the amount of cortical change observed across all 520 ADNI subjects. Within the stable Aβ group, however, cortical florbetapir change was 1%-2% across all reference regions, indicating high consistency. In the increasing Aβ group, cortical increases were significant with all reference regions. Reference regions containing WM (as opposed to cerebellum or pons) enabled detection of cortical change that was more physiologically plausible and more likely to increase over time.

Conclusion: Reference region selection has an important influence on the detection of florbetapir change. Compared with cerebellum or pons alone, reference regions that included subcortical WM resulted in change measurements that are more accurate. In addition, because use of WM-containing reference regions involves dividing out cortical signal contained in the reference region (via partial-volume effects), use of these WM-containing regions may result in more conservative estimates of actual change. Future analyses using different tracers, tracer-kinetic models, pipelines, and comparisons with other biomarkers will further optimize our ability to accurately measure Aβ changes over time.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25745095/
A novel blood-free analytical framework for the quantification of neuroinflammatory load from TSPO PET Imaging,"Lucia Maccioni, Ludovica Brusaferri, Leonardo Barzon, Julia J Schubert, Maria A Nettis, Oliver Cousins, Ivana Rosenzweig, Yuya Mizuno, Marta Vicente-Rodríguez, Nisha Singh, Tiago Reis Marques, Neil A Harrison, Tim Fryer, Edward T Bullmore, Diana Cash, Valeria Mondelli, Carmine Pariante, Oliver Howes, Federico E Turkheimer, Marco L Loggia, Mattia Veronese","Positron Emission Tomography (PET) of the 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO) is critical for neuroinflammation studies but faces substantial methodological challenges. These include issues with arterial blood sampling for kinetic modeling, the absence of suitable reference regions, genetic polymorphisms affecting tracer affinity, altered blood-to-brain tracer delivery in inflammatory conditions, and high signal variability. This study presents a novel blood-free reference-free method for TSPO PET quantification, leveraging a logistic regression model to estimate the probability of TSPO overexpression across brain regions. Validation was performed on 323 human brain scans from five datasets and three radiotracers. The quantified TSPO topology in healthy controls showed strong concordance with the constitutive TSPO gene expression for all tracers. When using [11C]PBR28 PET data, the method replicated previous findings in schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, chronic pain, and XBD173 blocking. However, model extension to [18F]DPA-714 and [11C]-(R)-PK11195 revealed small effect sizes and high variability, suggesting the need for tracer-specific model optimization. Finally, validation in a rat model of lipopolysaccharide-induced neuroinflammation confirmed previous evidence of increased brain TSPO uptake after a systemic challenge. This novel non-invasive method provides individualized TSPO PET quantification, demonstrating broad applicability across TSPO PET tracers and imaging sites, assuming sufficient training data for model development.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39975931/
Impulse-response function of splanchnic circulation with model-independent constraints: theory and experimental validation,"Ole L Munk, Susanne Keiding, Ludvik Bass","Modeling physiological processes using tracer kinetic methods requires knowledge of the time course of the tracer concentration in blood supplying the organ. For liver studies, however, inaccessibility of the portal vein makes direct measurement of the hepatic dual-input function impossible in humans. We want to develop a method to predict the portal venous time-activity curve from measurements of an arterial time-activity curve. An impulse-response function based on a continuous distribution of washout constants is developed and validated for the gut. Experiments with simultaneous blood sampling in aorta and portal vein were made in 13 anesthetized pigs following inhalation of intravascular [15O]CO or injections of diffusible 3-O-[11C]methylglucose (MG). The parameters of the impulse-response function have a physiological interpretation in terms of the distribution of washout constants and are mathematically equivalent to the mean transit time (T) and standard deviation of transit times. The results include estimates of mean transit times from the aorta to the portal vein in pigs: T = 0.35 +/- 0.05 min for CO and 1.7 +/- 0.1 min for MG. The prediction of the portal venous time-activity curve benefits from constraining the regression fits by parameters estimated independently. This is strong evidence for the physiological relevance of the impulse-response function, which includes asymptotically, and thereby justifies kinetically, a useful and simple power law. Similarity between our parameter estimates in pigs and parameter estimates in normal humans suggests that the proposed model can be adapted for use in humans.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12686507/
Pharmacokinetic Analysis of 11C-PBR28 in the Rat Model of Herpes Encephalitis: Comparison with (R)-11C-PK11195,"Andrea Parente, Paula Kopschina Feltes, David Vállez García, Jurgen W A Sijbesma, Cristina M Moriguchi Jeckel, Rudi A J O Dierckx, Erik F J de Vries, Janine Doorduin","(11)C-PBR28 is a second-generation translocator protein (TSPO) tracer with characteristics supposedly superior to the most commonly used tracer for neuroinflammation, (R)-(11)C-PK11195. Despite its use in clinical research, no studies on the imaging properties and pharmacokinetic analysis of (11)C-PBR28 in rodent models of neuroinflammation have been published yet. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate (11)C-PBR28 as a tool for detection and quantification of neuroinflammation in preclinical research and to compare its imaging properties with (R)-(11)C-PK11195. The herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) model was used for induction of neuroinflammation in male Wistar rats. Six or 7 d after virus inoculation, a dynamic (11)C-PBR28 or (R)-(11)C-PK11195 PET scan with arterial blood sampling was obtained. Pharmacokinetic modeling was performed on the PET data and analyzed using volumes of interest and a voxel-based approach. Volume-of-interest- and voxel-based analysis of (11)C-PBR28 images showed overexpression of TSPO in brain regions known to be affected in the HSE rat model. (11)C-PBR28 was metabolized faster than (R)-(11)C-PK11195, with a metabolic half-life in plasma of 5 and 21 min, respectively. Overall, (11)C-PBR28 was more sensitive than (R)-(11)C-PK11195 in detecting neuroinflammation. The binding potential (BPND) of (11)C-PBR28 was significantly higher (P < 0.05) in the medulla (176%), pons (146%), midbrain (101%), hippocampus (85%), thalamus (73%), cerebellum (54%), and hypothalamus (49%) in HSE rats than in control rats, whereas (R)-(11)C-PK11195 showed a higher BPND only in the medulla (32%). The BPND in control animals was not significantly different between tracers, suggesting that the nonspecific binding of both tracers is similar. (11)C-PBR28 was more sensitive than (R)-(11)C-PK11195 in the detection of TSPO overexpression in the HSE rat model, because more brain regions with significantly increased tracer uptake could be found, irrespective of the data analysis method used. These results suggest that (11)C-PBR28 should be able to detect more subtle changes in microglial activation in preclinical models of neuroinflammation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26823567/
Evaluation of motion correction methods in human brain PET imaging--a simulation study based on human motion data,"Xiao Jin, Tim Mulnix, Jean-Dominique Gallezot, Richard E Carson","Purpose: Motion correction in PET has become more important as system resolution has improved. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of event-by-event and frame-based MC methods in human brain PET imaging.

Methods: Motion compensated image reconstructions were performed with static and dynamic simulated high resolution research tomograph data with frame-based image reconstructions, using a range of measured human head motion data. Image intensities in high-contrast regions of interest (ROI) and parameter estimates in tracer kinetic models were assessed to evaluate the accuracy of the motion correction methods.

Results: Given accurate motion data, event-by-event motion correction can reliably correct for head motions. The average ROI intensities and the kinetic parameter estimates VT and BPND were comparable to the true values. The frame-based motion correction methods with correctly aligned attenuation map using the average of externally acquired motion data or motion data derived from image registration give comparable quantitative accuracy. For large intraframe (>5 mm) motion, the frame-based methods produced ≈ 9% bias in ROI intensities, ≈ 5% in VT, and ≈ 10% in BPND estimates. In addition, in real studies that lack a ground truth, the normalized weighted residual sum of squared difference is a potential figure-of-merit to evaluate the accuracy of motion correction methods.

Conclusions: The authors conclude that frame-based motion correction methods are accurate when the intraframe motion is less than 5 mm and when the attenuation map is accurately aligned. Given accurate motion data, event-by-event motion correction can reliably correct for head motion in human brain PET studies.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24089924/
"Small-animal PET with a σ-ligand, 11C-SA4503, detects spontaneous pituitary tumors in aged rats","Nisha K Ramakrishnan, Anna A Rybczynska, Anniek K D Visser, Krisztina Marosi, Csaba J Nyakas, Chantal Kwizera, Jurgen W A Sijbesma, Philip H Elsinga, Kiichi Ishiwata, Jan Pruim, Rudi A J O Dierckx, Aren van Waarde","Pituitary tumors are often detected only after death or at late stages of the disease when they are macroadenomas with a low surgical cure rate. Spontaneous pituitary tumors occur in rats over 1 y of age. In an ongoing study of changes in σ-1 agonist binding related to aging, several of our rats developed such tumors. The aim of the current study was to assess the kinetics of (11)C-SA4503 ((11)C-labeled 1-[2-(3,4-dimethoxyphenthyl)]-4-(3-phenylpropyl)-piperazine dihydrochloride) in tumor and brain and to evaluate the utility of this tracer in the detection of pituitary tumors.

Methods: Small-animal PET scans of the brain region of male Wistar Hannover rats (age, 18-32 mo) were acquired using the σ-1 agonist tracer (11)C-SA4503. The time-dependent uptake of (11)C in the entire brain, tumor or normal pituitary, and thyroid was measured. A 2-tissue-compartment model was fitted to the PET data, using metabolite-corrected plasma radioactivity as the input function.

Results: Pituitary tumors showed up as bright hot spots in the scans. The total distribution volume (VT) of the tracer was significantly higher in the tumor than in the normal pituitary. Surprisingly, a higher VT was also seen in the brain and thyroid tissue of animals with pituitary tumors than in healthy rats. The increase in VT in the brain and thyroid was not related to a change in nondisplaceable binding potential (BPND) but rather to an increase in the partition coefficient (K1/k2) of (11)C-SA4503. The increase in VT in the tumor on the other hand was accompanied by a significant increase in BPND. Western blotting analysis indicated that pituitary tumors overexpressed σ-1 receptors.

Conclusion: The overexpression of σ-1 receptors in spontaneous pituitary tumors is detected as an increase in uptake and BPND of (11)C-SA4503. Therefore, this tracer may have promise for the detection of pituitary adenomas, using PET.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23785170/
A new graphic plot analysis for determination of neuroreceptor binding in positron emission tomography studies,"Hiroshi Ito, Takashi Yokoi, Yoko Ikoma, Miho Shidahara, Chie Seki, Mika Naganawa, Hidehiko Takahashi, Harumasa Takano, Yuichi Kimura, Masanori Ichise, Tetsuya Suhara","In positron emission tomography (PET) studies with radioligands for neuroreceptors, tracer kinetics have been described by the standard two-tissue compartment model that includes the compartments of nondisplaceable binding and specific binding to receptors. In the present study, we have developed a new graphic plot analysis to determine the total distribution volume (V(T)) and nondisplaceable distribution volume (V(ND)) independently, and therefore the binding potential (BP(ND)). In this plot, Y(t) is the ratio of brain tissue activity to time-integrated arterial input function, and X(t) is the ratio of time-integrated brain tissue activity to time-integrated arterial input function. The x-intercept of linear regression of the plots for early phase represents V(ND), and the x-intercept of linear regression of the plots for delayed phase after the equilibrium time represents V(T). BP(ND) can be calculated by BP(ND)=V(T)/V(ND)-1. Dynamic PET scanning with measurement of arterial input function was performed on six healthy men after intravenous rapid bolus injection of [(11)C]FLB457. The plot yielded a curve in regions with specific binding while it yielded a straight line through all plot data in regions with no specific binding. V(ND), V(T), and BP(ND) values calculated by the present method were in good agreement with those by conventional non-linear least-squares fitting procedure. This method can be used to distinguish graphically whether the radioligand binding includes specific binding or not.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19631754/
Preclinical Evaluation and Quantification of 18F-FPEB as a Radioligand for PET Imaging of the Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor 5,"Bart de Laat, Gil Leurquin-Sterk, Sofie Celen, Guy Bormans, Michel Koole, Koen Van Laere, Cindy Casteels","The metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) is a high-interest target for PET imaging because it plays a role in several pathologies, including addiction, schizophrenia, and fragile X syndrome.

Methods: We studied the pharmacokinetics of (18)F-FPEB (3-(18)F-fluoro-5-(2-pyridinylethynyl)benzonitrile), a selective PET radioligand for mGluR5, and used it to quantify mGluR5 in rat brain. Quantification was performed using both arterial sampling in combination with compartment models and simplified reference methods. The simplified reference tissue model (SRTM), Ichise's original multi-linear reference tissue model (MRTMO), and Logan noninvasive were tested as reference models with nondisplaceable binding (BPND) as outcome parameter. Additionally, test-retest scans were obtained in 6 animals.

Results: (18)F-FPEB uptake in rat brain was consistent with its known distribution. No radiometabolites were present in the brain, and binding was specific as shown in blocking experiments, which also confirmed the cerebellum as a viable reference region. A 2-tissue-compartment model was used to determine BPND for the striatum (11.7 ± 1.5), nucleus accumbens (10.6 ± 2.0), hippocampus (9.0 ± 1.2), cortex (7.2 ± 1.0), and thalamus (4.0 ± 0.9). Reference methods were able to estimate these values with small bias (<2%). Test-retest analysis showed high repeatability between scans below 6%, also for shorter scan durations of 30 and 60 min.

Conclusion: Because of its favorable reversible kinetics, high specificity, and absence of brain radiometabolites (18)F-FPEB proves a highly useful tracer for in vivo visualization of the mGluR5 in rat brain. Moreover, reference tissue models allow noninvasive, rapid scanning with good test-retest.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26405172/
Measurement of myocardial glucose uptake in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy: application of a new quantitative method using regional tracer kinetic information,"H Wiggers, M Bøttcher, T T Nielsen, A Gjedde, H E Bøtker","Quantification of myocardial glucose uptake (MGU) by 18F-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG) using PET may be inaccurate, because the correction factor that relates myocardial FDG uptake to MGU, the lumped constant (LC), is not a true constant. Recent studies have shown that analysis of FDG time-activity curves allows determination of individual LCs and that variable LCs yield accurate determination of MGU. We compared the magnitude of the LC in different regions of the heart in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy.

Methods: Twenty patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy and an average ejection fraction of 33% underwent dynamic 13N-ammonia and FDG PET. We determined myocardial perfusion and MGU in 177 regions classified as control (71 regions), mismatch (50 regions) and match (56 regions), according to findings on PET and echocardiography. Regional MGU was calculated with both regional LCs and a fixed LC of 0.67.

Results: All results were expressed as mean +/- SD. Myocardial perfusion was highest in control regions (0.52+/-0.18 mL/g/min), reduced in mismatch regions (0.43+/-0.19 mL/g/min; P < 0.05 versus control) and severely reduced in match regions (0.28+/-0.17 mL/g/min; P < 0.001 versus control and mismatch). Regional LCs ranged from 0.45 to 1.30 and differed between patients (P < 0.001). Regional LCs were similar in regions diagnosed as control (0.78+/-0.23), mismatch (0.80+/-0.24) and match (0.72+/-0.21). MGU (micromol/g/min) calculated by regional LCs was similar in control (0.52+/-0.16) and mismatch (0.49+/-0.19) regions and decreased in match regions (0.31+/-0.12, P < 0.001). The agreement between MGU calculated with variable and fixed LCs was poor.

Conclusion: The LC used in the calculation of MGU was not affected by regional differences in the metabolic state of the myocardium. However, the LC varied substantially between patients in control, mismatch and match regions. These findings indicate that quantitative measurements of MGU using a fixed LC must be interpreted with caution.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10450680/
Kinetic model analysis for absorbed dose calculation applied to brain in [¹⁸F]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography imaging,"Eric Laffon, Manuel Bardiès, Jacques Barbet, Roger Marthan","A kinetic model analysis has been proposed to assess absorbed dose to an arbitrary tissue in [¹⁸F]-fluorodeoxyglucose ([¹⁸F]-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, whose efficiency is demonstrated in physiological brain, by comparing calculated estimates with human literature data. First, an analytic solution for the tissue [¹⁸F]-FDG time-activity curve has been derived from kinetic model analysis, assuming reversible radiotracer trapping. Then, integrating this solution from the time of tracer administration to infinity yielded analytic solutions for cumulated activity (and hence for the ratio of cumulated/injected activity) and the percentage of tracer uptake for an arbitrary tissue. Calculated estimates from these analytic solutions for the whole gray and white matter have been found in very good agreement with human literature data: 7.55 versus 6.57 (±1.51) MBq·hour (per unit of administered activity of 37 MBq), 0.204 versus 0.220 (±0.090) hour, and 6.25% versus 6.90%, respectively. This study concludes that the proposed kinetic model analysis has proven effective in assessing absorbed dose to human brain in [¹⁸F]-FDG PET imaging, under physiological conditions. This study suggests that this model could be further developed to assess absorbed dose to other tissues, either healthy or pathological, and also it could be further considered by involving other PET tracer features.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21204760/
Development and In Vivo Evaluation of a κ-Opioid Receptor Agonist as a PET Radiotracer with Superior Imaging Characteristics,"Songye Li, Ming-Qiang Zheng, Mika Naganawa, Sujin Kim, Hong Gao, Michael Kapinos, David Labaree, Yiyun Huang","Studies have shown κ-opioid receptor (KOR) abnormalities in addictive disorders, other central nervous system diseases, and Alzheimer's disease.

PET studies were performed on rhesus monkeys. Blocking studies were performed with naloxone and the selective KOR antagonists LY2795050 and LY2456302. Arterial input functions were generated for use in kinetic modeling. Brain TACs were analyzed with multilinear analysis 1 to derive binding parameters.Results:EKAP has high KOR affinity (inhibition constant, 0.28 nM) and good selectivity in vitro.11C-EKAP was prepared in good radiochemical purity.11C-EKAP rapidly metabolized in plasma and displayed fast and reversible kinetics in brain, with peak uptake at less than 20 min after injection. Preblocking with naloxone (1 mg/kg) or LY2795050 (0.2 mg/kg) produced 84%-89% receptor occupancy, whereas LY2456302 (0.05 and 0.3 mg/kg) dose-dependently reduced11C-EKAP-specific binding, thus demonstrating its binding specificity and selectivity in vivo. Mean multilinear analysis 1-derived nondisplaceable binding potential values were 1.74, 1.79, 1.46, 0.80, and 0.77 for cingulate cortex, globus pallidus, insula, striatum, and frontal cortex, respectively, consistent with the known KOR distribution in primate brains.Conclusion:We have successfully developed11C-EKAP as a KOR agonist tracer with dual attractive imaging properties of fast uptake kinetics and high specific binding in vivo.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30630942/

Procedures: Rats with implanted untreated (n = 10) or irradiated (n = 7, 1 × 25 Gy, on day 8) orthotopic gliomas were scanned after 6, 9, and 12 days, using positron emission tomography. Rats with striatal injections of saline (n = 9) or bacterial lipopolysaccharide (n = 9) were scanned after 3 days.

Results: Uptake of the two tracers in untreated gliomas was similar. [11C]MCYS was not accumulated in salivary glands, nasal epithelium, and healing wounds, in contrast to [11C]MET, but showed 40 % higher accumulation in the healthy brain. Both tracers showed a reduced tumor uptake 4 days after irradiation and minor accumulation in inflamed striatum. [11C]MCYS indicated higher lesion volumes than [11C]MET (untreated tumor + 47 %; irradiated tumor up to + 500 %; LPS-inflamed striatum + 240 %).

Initial characterization of a PDE10A selective positron emission tomography tracer [11C]AMG 7980 in non-human primates,"Dah-Ren Hwang, Essa Hu, Shannon Rumfelt, Balu Easwaramoorthy, John Castrillon, Carl Davis, Jennifer R Allen, Hang Chen, James Treanor, Anissa Abi-Dargham, Mark Slifstein","Introduction: Phosphodiesterase 10A (PDE10A) is an intracellular enzyme responsible for the breakdown of cyclic nucleotides which are important secondary messengers in the central nervous system. Inhibition of PDE10A has been identified as a potential therapeutic target for treatment of various neuropsychiatric disorders. To assist the drug development program, we have identified a selective PDE10A PET tracer, [(11)C]AMG 7980, for imaging PDE10A distribution using positron emission tomography.

Methods: [(11)C]AMG 7980 was prepared in a one-pot, two-step reaction. Dynamic PET scans were performed in non-human primates following a bolus or bolus plus constant infusion tracer injection paradigm. Regions-of-interest were defined on individuals' MRIs and transferred to the co-registered PET images. Data were analyzed using Logan graphical analysis with metabolite-corrected input function, the simplified reference tissue model (SRTM) method and occupancy plots. A benchmark PDE10A inhibitor was used to demonstrate PDE10A-specific binding.

Results: [(11)C]AMG 7980 was prepared with a mean specific activity of 99 ± 74 GBq/μmol (n=10) and a synthesis time of 45 min. Specific binding of the tracer was localized to the striatum and globus pallidus (GP) and low in other brain regions. Thalamus was used as the reference tissue to derive binding potentials (BPND). The BPND for caudate, putamen, and GP were 0.23, 0.65, 0.51, respectively by the graphical method, and 0.42, 0.76, and 0.75 from the SRTM method. A dose dependent decrease of BPND was observed with the pre-treatment of a PDE10A inhibitor. A bolus plus infusion injection paradigm yielded similar results.

Conclusion: [(11)C]AMG 7980 has been successfully used for imaging PDE10A in non-human primate brain. Despite the fast brain kinetics it can be used to measure target occupancy of PDE10A inhibitors in non-human primates and potentially applicable to humans.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24607437/
Calculation of the FDG lumped constant by simultaneous measurements of global glucose and FDG metabolism in humans,"S G Hasselbalch, P L Madsen, G M Knudsen, S Holm, O B Paulson","The lumped constant defined as the conversion factor between the net uptake of fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) and glucose was calculated from global CMRglc and from positron emission tomography (PET) using FDG as tracer (CMRFDG). Fifteen healthy, normal volunteers (mean age 24 +/- 4 years) were studied. Global CBF and CMRglc were measured with the Kety-Schmidt technique using 133Xe as tracer, and values were corrected for errors from incomplete diffusion equilibrium for inert gas tracer between brain tissue and cerebral venous blood. Measurements of CMRFDG were obtained with PET using the dynamic and single-scan methods and the K1-k3 model. Measurements with the Kety-Schmidt technique and PET-FDG were performed simultaneously. Global CBF was 47.1 +/- 8.0 mL.100 g-1.min-1, and CMRglc was 22.8 +/- 4.1 mumol.100 g-1.min-1. No difference in CMRFDG was found with the two methods (17.8 +/- 1.6 and 18.2 +/- 1.3 mumol .100 g-1.min-1, dynamic and single scan methods, respectively). Accordingly, the lumped constant ranged from 0.80 +/- 0.16 to 0.82 +/- 0.15, with a mean value of 0.81 +/- 0.15. The mean ratio between phosphorylation of FDG and glucose (k3*/k3) was 0.39 +/- 0.25. The discrepancy between the lumped constant determined in this study and previously obtained values can be explained partly by methodologic problems, and we conclude that most of the discrepancy results from previous overestimation of global CBF.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9469157/
Preclinical evaluation of carbon-11 and fluorine-18 sulfonamide derivatives for in vivo radiolabeling of erythrocytes,"Olivier Gheysens, Vamsidhar Akurathi, Rufael Chekol, Tom Dresselaers, Sofie Celen, Michel Koole, Dieter Dauwe, Bernard J Cleynhens, Piet Claus, Stefan Janssens, Alfons M Verbruggen, Johan Nuyts, Uwe Himmelreich, Guy M Bormans","Background: To date, few PET tracers for in vivo labeling of red blood cells (RBCs) are available. In this study, we report the radiosynthesis and in vitro and in vivo evaluation of 11C and 18F sulfonamide derivatives targeting carbonic anhydrase II (CA II), a metallo-enzyme expressed in RBCs, as potential blood pool tracers. A proof-of-concept in vivo imaging study was performed to demonstrate the feasibility to assess cardiac function and volumes using electrocardiogram (ECG)-gated positron emission tomography (PET) acquisition in comparison with cine magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI) in rats and a pig model of myocardial infarction.

Methods: The inhibition constants (Ki) of CA II were determined in vitro for the different compounds by assaying CA-catalyzed CO2 hydration activity. Binding to human RBCs was estimated after in vitro incubation of the compounds with whole blood. Biodistribution studies were performed to evaluate tracer kinetics in NMRI mice. ECG-gated PET acquisition was performed in Wistar rats at rest and during pharmacological stress by infusing dobutamine at 10 μg/kg/min and in a pig model of myocardial infarction. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and volumes were compared with values from cMRI.

Results: The Ki of the investigated compounds for human CA II was found to be in the range of 8 to 422 nM. The fraction of radioactivity associated with RBCs was found to be ≥90% at 10- and 60-min incubation of tracers with heparinized human blood at room temperature for all tracers studied. Biodistribution studies in mice indicated that 30% to 67% of the injected dose was retained in the blood pool at 60 min post injection. A rapid and sustained tracer uptake in the heart region with an average standardized uptake value of 2.5 was observed from micro-PET images. The LVEF values obtained after pharmacological stress in rats closely matched between the cMRI and micro-PET values, whereas at rest, a larger variation between LVEF values obtained by both techniques was observed. In the pig model, a good agreement was observed between PET and MRI for quantification of left ventricular volumes and ejection fraction.

Conclusions: The 11C and 18F sulfonamide derivatives can be used for efficient in vivo radiolabeling of RBCs, and proof-of-concept in vivo imaging studies have shown the feasibility and potential of these novel tracers to assess cardiac function.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23316861/
"[11C]palmitate kinetics across the splanchnic bed in arterial, portal and hepatic venous plasma during fasting and euglycemic hyperinsulinemia","Letizia Guiducci, Mikko Järvisalo, Jan Kiss, Kjell Någren, Antti Viljanen, Alexandru G Naum, Amalia Gastaldelli, Timo Savunen, Juhani Knuuti, Piero A Salvadori, Ele Ferrannini, Pirjo Nuutila, Patricia Iozzo","Purpose: The liver is fundamental in regulating lipid metabolism, and it supplies fatty acids (FA) to the rest of the body in the form of triglycerides (TG); the time-related relevance of this process is incompletely defined. The aim of the study was to investigate the appearance of labeled TG in the hepatic vascular bed after [11C]palmitate injection during fasting and insulin stimulation.

Methods: Plasma [11C]palmitate kinetics in arterial, portal and hepatic venous lipid fractions was studied in eight anesthetized pigs during fasting or euglycemic hyperinsulinemia. Plasma analyses were conducted at 10 and 40 min after tracer injection. Corresponding liver positron emission tomography (PET) images were acquired for the semiquantitative determination of hepatic FA uptake.

Results: At 10 min, plasma levels of unchanged [11C]palmitate were lower in hyperinsulinemic than in fasting experiments in the artery and in the portal vein (P< or=.03), suggesting faster clearance. Levels of unmetabolized [11C]palmitate did not differ between portal and arterial plasma. In the fasting state, a tendency to a positive arterial and portal vs. hepatic venous gradient was observed, indicative of net hepatic [11C]palmitate extraction. Labeled TG were already detectable at 10 min (fasting vs. hyperinsulinemia, ns) and were higher in fasting than in hyperinsulinemic animals at 40 min (92+/-1% and 82+/-6% of arterial plasma radioactivity). Higher proportions of labeled TG were recovered in portal vein plasma, suggesting release by the gut. The portal and the arterial-portal vs. hepatic venous TG gradient tended to be positive. Accordingly, hepatic FA uptake was higher, but declined more rapidly during fasting than during hyperinsulinemia.

Conclusion: The study indicates that the redistribution of [11C]palmitate between different lipid pools occurs within the short time interval of most PET experiments and is strongly influenced by insulin. Labeled TG constitute an additional [11C]palmitate source in the modeling of PET data.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16720244/
Parametric methods for quantification of 18F-FAZA kinetics in non-small cell lung cancer patients,"Eline E Verwer, Idris Bahce, Floris H P van Velden, Maqsood Yaqub, Robert C Schuit, Albert D Windhorst, Pieter Raijmakers, Otto S Hoekstra, Adriaan A Lammertsma, Egbert F Smit, Ronald Boellaard","(18)F-fluoroazomycinarabinoside ((18)F-FAZA) is a hypoxia-specific PET tracer. In future clinical applications of hypoxia imaging, such as early response monitoring or radiation therapy dose painting, accurate quantification of tracer uptake at the voxel level will be required. The aim of the present study was to assess the validity of parametric methods for the quantification of (18)F-FAZA studies.

Methods: Dynamic 70-min (18)F-FAZA scans were obtained from 9 non-small cell lung cancer patients. Arterial blood samples, collected at 7 time points, were used for preprocessing an image-derived input function derived from volumes of interest (VOIs) defined within the ascending aorta. Time-activity curves derived from various tumor VOIs were fitted using nonlinear regression analysis (NLR) to a reversible 2-tissue-compartment model, providing volumes of distribution (V(T)) as an outcome measure. Next, parametric images were generated by use of both Logan graphic analysis with various linear regression start times and spectral analysis with multiple sets of basis functions. The previously defined tumor VOIs were projected onto these parametric images, and the resulting V(T) were compared with those obtained from NLR. In addition, the results were compared with tumor-to-blood ratios (SUVr), which are more easily obtainable.

Results: The highest correlations and correspondence with NLR-derived V(T) were found for Logan graphic analysis with a start time of 30 min after injection (R(2), 0.88; intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC], 0.93) and for spectral analysis-derived V(T) with a set of 30 basis functions with exponents ranging from 0.0175 to 1.9 (R(2), 0.79; ICC, 0.81). SUVr yielded similar correlations but showed significant bias at high V(T) (R(2), 0.85; ICC, 0.80).

Conclusion: Both Logan graphic analysis and spectral analysis yielded V(T) that showed high correlations with nonlinear regression analysis-derived V(T). SUVr showed bias at high V(T).",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25324522/
Noninvasive quantification of the differential portal and arterial contribution to the liver blood supply from PET measurements using the 11C-acetate kinetic model,"Sirong Chen, Dagan Feng","Our recent research has demonstrated that 11C-acetate could be a complementary tracer to 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) in positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In our previous modeling study, a three-compartment four-parameter model with a fixed contribution ratio of the liver's two blood supplies was proposed to characterize the kinetic behavior of 11C-acetate in liver. However, in real pathology, both tumor and nontumor liver tissue can be heterogeneous in the distribution and proportion of the two blood supplies. To further improve the accuracy of quantitative analysis, the actual proportion of the hepatic artery and portal vein (PV) in different regions of interest (ROIs) was investigated in this study. An extra parameter av was included in the model input function to describe the contribution of PV to the liver. Ten ROIs extracted from six patients were used to test the models with fixed/nonfixed weighted dual-input function. The weighted nonlinear least squares algorithm was used to estimate all of the parameters. Evaluation of the adequacy of the two models was conducted and the computer simulation was performed to test the estimation accuracy of the new model. The forward clearance K was also estimated by the linear Patlak method. The results show that the model with parameter av in the input function was more suitable for mapping the tracer time activity curves. Moreover, the estimated av value fits the practical physiological and pathological conditions well and could be a potential candidate to provide useful additional diagnostic information for the early detection of hepatic metastases.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15376506/
Integrin alpha v beta 3-targeted imaging of lung cancer,"Xiaoyuan Chen, Eric Sievers, Yingping Hou, Ryan Park, Michel Tohme, Robert Bart, Ross Bremner, James R Bading, Peter S Conti","A series of radiolabeled cyclic arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) peptide ligands for cell adhesion molecule integrin alpha v beta 3-targeted tumor angiogenesis targeting are being developed in our laboratory. In this study, this effort continues by applying a positron emitter 64Cu-labeled PEGylated dimeric RGD peptide radiotracer 64Cu-DOTA-PEG-E[c(RGDyK)]2 for lung cancer imaging. The PEGylated RGD peptide indicated integrin alpha v beta 3 avidity, but the PEGylation reduced the receptor binding affinity of this ligand compared to the unmodified RGD dimer. The radiotracer revealed rapid blood clearance and predominant renal clearance route. The minimum nonspecific activity accumulation in normal lung tissue and heart rendered high-quality orthotopic lung cancer tumor images, enabling clear demarcation of both the primary tumor at the upper lobe of the left lung, as well as metastases in the mediastinum, contralateral lung, and diaphragm. As a comparison, fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) scans on the same mice were only able to identify the primary tumor, with the metastatic lesions masked by intense cardiac uptake and high lung background. 64Cu-DOTA-PEG-E[c(RGDyK)]2 is an excellent position emission tomography (PET) tracer for integrin-positive tumor imaging. Further studies to improve the receptor binding affinity of the tracer and subsequently to increase the magnitude of tumor uptake without comprising the favorable in vivo kinetics are currently in progress.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15799827/

Pharmacokinetic modelling of N-(4-[(18)F]fluorobenzoyl)interleukin-2 binding to activated lymphocytes in an xenograft model of inflammation,"Valentina Di Gialleonardo, Alberto Signore, Antoon T M Willemsen, Jurgen W A Sijbesma, Rudi A J O Dierckx, Erik F J de Vries","Purpose: N-(4-[(18)F]Fluorobenzoyl)interleukin-2 ([(18)F]FB-IL2) specifically binds to interleukin-2 receptors (IL-2R) and thus may be used to detect inflammation processes using positron emission tomography (PET). We now validated whether [(18)F]FB-IL2 can be used to quantify activated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (hPBMC) in rats by pharmacokinetic modelling.

Methods: Eleven Wistar rats were subcutaneously inoculated in the shoulder with different amounts of phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) activated hPBMC 15 min before i.v. injection of [(18)F]FB-IL2. A 60-min dynamic PET scan was acquired and arterial blood sampling and metabolite analysis were performed. At the end of the scan, animals were terminated and the inflammatory lesion dissected. PET data were analysed using Logan and Patlak analysis as well as one-tissue and two-tissue compartment models. Model preferences according to the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and correlation between PET measurements and the number of CD25-positive cells were evaluated.

Results: A high correlation between ex vivo tracer uptake (standardized uptake value) in the xenograft and the number of inoculated CD25-positive cells was observed (R (2) = 0.90). Plasma time-activity curves showed a rapid washout of the radiopharmaceutical from blood, while the time-activity curves of the inflammatory lesions showed slower washout. Time-activity curves could be fitted well by the Logan analysis method, indicating that the binding between [(18)F]FB-IL2 and CD25 is reversible. AIC indicated that data could be modelled best by a two-tissue reversible compartment model. A high correlation was observed between the binding potential and the number of CD25-positive cells (R (2) = 0.876, p < 0.0001). Based on binding potential measured by PET, the limit of detection was about 160,000 CD25-positive cells per 200 μl lesion (95 % confidence).

Conclusion: [(18)F]FB-IL2 kinetics in this animal model of inflammation could be best described by a reversible two-tissue compartment model. The [(18)F]FB-IL2 binding potential is a suitable measure for accurate quantification of lymphocytic infiltration in pathological conditions with PET.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22777334/
Kinetics of [(11)C]choline uptake in prostate cancer: a PET study,"Eija Sutinen, Martti Nurmi, Anne Roivainen, Matti Varpula, Tuula Tolvanen, Pertti Lehikoinen, Heikki Minn","Carbon-11 choline has recently been introduced as a potential tracer for tumour imaging with positron emission tomography (PET). We evaluated the kinetics of the uptake of [(11)C]choline in prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia. We also evaluated the association between the uptake of [(11)C]choline and the histological grade of malignancy, Gleason score, volume of the prostate and prostate-specific antigen (PSA). Fourteen patients with histologically confirmed prostate cancer and five patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia were studied with [(11)C]choline PET. A mean dose of 430+/-31 MBq of [(11)C]choline was injected intravenously and a dynamic emission acquisition of prostate was performed for 30 min. The uptake of [(11)C]choline was measured as a standardised uptake value (SUV) and as a kinetic influx constant ( K(i)) obtained from graphical analysis. Both cancerous and hyperplastic prostate were well visualised with [(11)C]choline against low or moderate tracer accumulation in the bladder and rectal wall. The measured radioactivity in urine was invariably low. In the graphical analysis, linear plots were achieved. The mean K(i) of the untreated tumour was 0.205+/-0.089 min(-1) (range 0.128-0.351; n=7) and the mean SUV was 5.6+/-3.2 (range 1.9-15.5; n=15). K(i) values and SUVs correlated closely ( r=0.964, P=0.0005), whereas no correlation could be demonstrated between the tumour uptake of [(11)C]choline and the histological grade, Gleason score, volume of the prostate or PSA. The mean SUV and the mean K(i) of benign hyperplastic prostate were 3.5+/-1.0 (range 2.0-4.5; n=4) and 0.119+/-0.076 min(-1) (range 0.065-0.173; n=2). In conclusion, a high uptake of [(11)C]choline characterises not only carcinomatous but also hyperplastic prostatic tissue. Dynamic imaging of the uptake of [(11)C]choline in the prostate shows a good applicability of the graphical analysis model with an irreversible compartment. A close correlation between the K(i) values and semiquantitative SUVs of tumours supports the use of the simpler SUV in the clinical setting.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14628097/
Pairwise comparison of 89Zr- and 124I-labeled cG250 based on positron emission tomography imaging and nonlinear immunokinetic modeling: in vivo carbonic anhydrase IX receptor binding and internalization in mouse xenografts of clear-cell renal cell carcinoma,"Sarah M Cheal, Blesida Punzalan, Michael G Doran, Michael J Evans, Joseph R Osborne, Jason S Lewis, Pat Zanzonico, Steven M Larson","Purpose: The PET tracer, (124)I-cG250, directed against carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) shows promise for presurgical diagnosis of clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) (Divgi et al. in Lancet Oncol 8:304-310, 2007; Divgi et al. in J Clin Oncol 31:187-194, 2013). The radiometal (89)Zr, however, may offer advantages as a surrogate PET nuclide over (124)I in terms of greater tumor uptake and retention (Rice et al. in Semin Nucl Med 41:265-282, 2011). We have developed a nonlinear immunokinetic model to facilitate a quantitative comparison of absolute uptake and antibody turnover between (124)I-cG250 and (89)Zr-cG250 using a human ccRCC xenograft tumor model in mice. We believe that this unique model better relates quantitative imaging data to the salient biological features of tumor antibody-antigen binding and turnover.

Methods: We conducted experiments with (89)Zr-cG250 and (124)I-cG250 using a human ccRCC cell line (SK-RC-38) to characterize the binding affinity and internalization kinetics of the two tracers in vitro. Serial PET imaging was performed in mice bearing subcutaneous ccRCC tumors to simultaneously detect and quantify time-dependent tumor uptake in vivo. Using the known specific activities of the two tracers, the equilibrium rates of antibody internalization and turnover in the tumors were derived from the PET images using nonlinear compartmental modeling.

Results: The two tracers demonstrated virtually identical tumor cell binding and internalization but showed markedly different retentions in vitro. Superior PET images were obtained using (89)Zr-cG250, owing to the more prolonged trapping of the radiolabel in the tumor and simultaneous washout from normal tissues. Estimates of cG250/CAIX complex turnover were 1.35 - 5.51 × 10(12) molecules per hour per gram of tumor (20 % of receptors internalized per hour), and the ratio of (124)I/(89)Zr atoms released per unit time by tumor was 17.5.

Conclusion: Pairwise evaluation of (89)Zr-cG250 and (124)I-cG250 provided the basis for a nonlinear immunokinetic model which yielded quantitative information about the binding and internalization of radioantibody bound to CAIX on tumor cells in vivo. (89)Zr-cG250 is likely to provide high-quality PET images and may be a useful tool to quantify CAIX/cG250 receptor turnover and cG250-accessible antigen density noninvasively in humans.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24604591/
Cerebral and myocardial kinetics of [11C]acetoacetate and [11C]β-hydroxybutyrate: A comparative crossover study in healthy rats,"Mette Louise Gram Kjærulff, Thien Vinh Luong, Gabriel Richard, Valérie St-Pierre, Esben Søndergaard, Niels Møller, Lars Christian Gormsen, Sébastien Tremblay, Etienne Croteau, Stephen C Cunnane","Background: Ketone metabolism has been studied using positron emission tomography (PET) with the radiotracers [11C]acetoacetate and [11C]β-hydroxybutyrate. However, whether these two radiotracers actually yield equivalent estimates of cerebral and myocardial ketone metabolism has not yet been investigated. This study aimed to investigate and compare the kinetics of both tracers in the brain and heart of healthy rats under varying levels of circulating ketones at baseline and after a single-dose exogenous ketone ester (KE) supplement.

Methods: Six healthy Sprague-Dawley rats each underwent two scans with each tracer: one following oral KE administration and one with a placebo. Cerebral kinetic parameters (Ki, VT, and cerebral metabolic rate (CMR)) were obtained using the Patlak method, whereas myocardial kinetic parameters (K1, k2, and VT) were derived using a 1-tissue compartment model. Parameters were compared through mixed-effects, correlation, and Bland-Altman analyses.

Results: Global CMR increased 3-4-fold in the KE group versus placebo, with strong positive correlations between CMR and plasma ketone levels for both tracers. Correlations between [11C]acetoacetate and [11C]β-hydroxybutyrate were moderate and non-significant for relative cerebral uptake expressed as Ki(ρ = 0.40) and for VT(ρ = 0.38) but strongly positive for absolute uptake, CMR (r = 0.84), with a non-significant mean bias of -0.03. In contrast, myocardial kinetics showed only non-significant weak to moderate correlations between the radiotracers (K1(r = 0.04), k2(r = -0.27), and VT(ρ = 0.43)), with no systematic biases.

Conclusion: [11C]acetoacetate and [11C]β-hydroxybutyrate can be used interchangeably for measuring global CMR in healthy rats but differ in certain cerebral and myocardial kinetics. Whether these findings are generalizable to pathological conditions warrants further studies to explore the kinetics of these tracers in disease models.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39476467/
In vivo cerebral protein synthesis rates with leucyl-transfer RNA used as a precursor pool: determination of biochemical parameters to structure tracer kinetic models for positron emission tomography,"R E Keen, J R Barrio, S C Huang, R A Hawkins, M E Phelps","Leucine oxidation and incorporation into proteins were examined in the in vivo rat brain to determine rates and compartmentation of these processes for the purpose of structuring mathematical compartmental models for the noninvasive estimation of in vivo human cerebral protein synthesis rates (CPSR) using positron emission tomography (PET). Leucine specific activity (SA) in arterial plasma and intracellular free amino acids, leucyl-tRNA, alpha-ketoisocaproic acid (KIC), and protein were determined in whole brain of the adult rat during the first 35 min after intravenous bolus injection of L-[1-14C]leucine. Incorporation of leucine into proteins accounted for 90% of total brain radioactivity at 35 min. The lack of [14C]KIC buildup indicates that leucine oxidation in brain is transaminase limited. Characteristic specific activities were maximal between 0 to 2 min after bolus injection with subsequent decline following the pattern: plasma leucine greater than or equal to leucyl-tRNA approximately KIC greater than intracellular leucine. The time integral of leucine SA in plasma was about four times that of tissue leucine and twice those of leucyl-tRNA and KIC, indicating the existence of free leucine, leucyl-tRNA, and KIC tissue compartments, communicating directly with plasma, and separate secondary free leucine, leucyl-tRNA, and KIC tissue compartments originating in unlabeled leucine from proteolysis. Therefore, a relatively simple model configuration based on the key assumptions that (a) protein incorporation and catabolism proceed from a precursor pool communicating with the plasma space, and (b) leucine catabolism is transaminase limited is justified for the in vivo assessment of CPSR from exogenous leucine sources using PET in humans.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2786884/
A beta-scintillator for surface measurements of radiotracer kinetics in the intact rodent cortex,"Matthias T Wyss, Nicolas M Obrist, Florent Haiss, Rolf Eckert, Ross Stanley, Cyrill Burger, Alfred Buck, Bruno Weber","Beta+-sensitive probes are useful tools for the measurement of radiotracer kinetics in small animals. They allow the cost-effective development of new PET tracers and offer the possibility to investigate a variety of cerebral processes. The study's main aim was the in vivo evaluation of a probe system for cerebral surface acquisitions. The detector system is a 0.2-mm thick scintillating disk of 3-mm diameter, positioned close to the cerebral surface. The study consists of 4 subparts: (1) simulation of the detection volume, (2) direct comparison with the classic intracortical beta probe regarding its capability to acquire kinetic data, (3) test of the ability to detect local tracer accumulations during infraorbital nerve (ION) electrostimulation and (4) demonstration of the feasibility to measure tracer kinetics in awake animals. Kinetic data acquired with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose and 15O-H2O were fitted with standard compartment models. The surface probe measurements were in good agreement with those obtained using the intracortical scintillator. ION electrostimulation induced a marked increase in tracer accumulation adequately detected by the surface probe. In the head-fixed animal, a marked change in FDG kinetics was detected between the awake and anesthetized state. The novel surface probe system proved to be a valuable instrument for in vivo radiotracer studies of the cerebral cortex. Its main advantage is the absence of any tissue damage. In addition, serial acquisitions of tracer kinetics in the awake animal turned out to be feasible.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19591950/
Multi-resolution Bayesian regression in PET dynamic studies using wavelets,"F E Turkheimer, J A D Aston, M-C Asselin, R Hinz","In the kinetic analysis of dynamic PET data, one usually posits that the variation of the data through one dimension, time, can be described by a mathematical model encapsulating the relevant physiological features of the radioactive tracer. In this work, we posit that the remaining dimension, space, can also be modeled as a physiological feature, and we introduce this concept into a new computational procedure for the production of parametric maps. An organ and, in the instance considered here, the brain presents similarities in the physiological properties of its elements across scales: computationally, this similarity can be implemented in two stages. Firstly, a multi-scale decomposition of the dynamic frames is created through the wavelet transform. Secondly, kinetic analysis is performed in wavelet space and the kinetic parameters estimated at low resolution are used as priors to inform estimates at higher resolutions. Kinetic analysis in the above scheme is achieved by extension of the Patlak analysis through Bayesian linear regression that retains the simplicity and speed of the original procedure. Application to artificial and real data (FDG and FDOPA) demonstrates the ability of the procedure to reduce remarkably the variance of parametric maps (up to 4-fold reduction) without introducing sizeable bias. Significance of the methodology and extension of the procedure to other data (fMRI) and models are discussed.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16644238/
Spectral analysis of dynamic PET studies,"V J Cunningham, T Jones","We describe a new technique for the analysis of dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) studies in humans, where data consist of the time courses of label in tissue regions of interest and in arterial blood, following the administration of radiolabelled tracers. The technique produces a simple spectrum of the kinetic components which relate the tissue's response to the blood activity curve. From this summary of the kinetic components, the tissue's unit impulse response can be derived. The convolution of the arterial input function with the derived unit impulse response function gives the curve of best fit to the observed tissue data. The analysis makes no a priori assumptions regarding the number of compartments or components required to describe the time course of label in the tissue. Rather, it is based on a general linear model, presented here in a formulation compatible with its solution using standard computer algorithms. Its application is illustrated with reference to cerebral blood flow, glucose utilization, and ligand binding. The interpretation of the spectra, and of the tissue unit impulse response functions, are discussed in terms of vascular components, unidirectional clearance of tracer by the tissue, and reversible and irreversible phenomena. The significance of the number of components which can be identified within a given datum set is also discussed.

"[11C]mHED PET follows a two-tissue compartment model in mouse myocardium with norepinephrine transporter (NET)-dependent uptake, while [18F]LMI1195 uptake is NET-independent","Linjing Mu, Stefanie D Krämer, Geoffrey I Warnock, Achi Haider, Susan Bengs, Giovanni Cartolano, Dominic S Bräm, Claudia Keller, Roger Schibli, Simon M Ametamey, Philipp A Kaufmann, Catherine Gebhard","Purpose: Clinical positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of the presynaptic norepinephrine transporter (NET) function provides valuable diagnostic information on sympathetic outflow and neuronal status. As data on the NET-targeting PET tracers [11C]meta-hydroxyephedrine ([11C]mHED) and [18F]LMI1195 ([18F]flubrobenguane) in murine experimental models are scarce or lacking, we performed a detailed characterization of their myocardial uptake pattern and investigated [11C]mHED uptake by kinetic modelling.

Methods: [11C]mHED and [18F]LMI1195 accumulation in the heart was studied by PET/CT in FVB/N mice. To test for specific uptake by NET, desipramine, a selective NET inhibitor, was administered by intraperitoneal injection. [11C]mHED kinetic modelling with input function from an arteriovenous shunt was performed in three mice.

Results: Both tracers accumulated in the mouse myocardium; however, only [11C]mHED uptake was significantly reduced by excess amount of desipramine. Myocardial [11C]mHED uptake was half-saturated at 88.3 nmol/kg of combined mHED and metaraminol residual. After [11C]mHED injection, a radiometabolite was detected in plasma and urine, but not in the myocardium. [11C]mHED kinetics followed serial two-tissue compartment models with desipramine-sensitive K1.

Conclusion: PET with [11C]mHED but not [18F]LMI1195 provides information on NET function in the mouse heart. [11C]mHED PET is dose-independent in the mouse myocardium at < 10 nmol/kg of combined mHED and metaraminol. [11C]mHED kinetics followed serial two-tissue compartment models with K1representing NET transport. Myocardial [11C]mHED uptake obtained from PET images may be used to assess cardiac sympathetic integrity in mouse models of cardiovascular disease.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32990788/
Potential of [11C]acetate for measuring myocardial blood flow: Studies in normal subjects and patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,"S A J Timmer, M Lubberink, T Germans, M J W Götte, J M ten Berg, F J ten Cate, A C van Rossum, A A Lammertsma, P Knaapen","Background: Measuring the rate of clearance of carbon-11 labelled acetate from myocardium using positron emission tomography (PET) is an accepted technique for noninvasively assessing myocardial oxygen consumption. Initial myocardial uptake of [(11)C]acetate, however, is related to myocardial blood flow (MBF) and several tracer kinetic models for quantifying MBF using [(11)C]acetate have been proposed. The objective of this study was to assess these models.

Methods: Eighteen healthy subjects and 18 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) were studied under baseline conditions with [(11)C]acetate and [(15)O]water. Four previously reported methods, including single- and multi-tissue compartment models, were used to calculate MBF from the measured [(11)C]acetate rate of influx K (1) and the (previously) reported relationship between K (1) and MBF. These MBF values were then compared with those derived from corresponding [(15)O]water studies.

Results: For all models, correlations between [(11)C]acetate and [(15)O]water-derived MBF ranged from .67 to .86 (all P < .005) in the control group and from .73 to .85 (all P < .001) in the HCM group. Two out of four models systematically underestimated perfusion with [(11)C]acetate, whilst the third model resulted in an overestimation. The fourth model, based on a simple single tissue compartment model with spillover, partial volume and recirculating metabolite corrections, resulted in a regression equation with a slope of near unity and an Y-intercept of almost zero (controls, K(1) = .74[MBF] + .09, r = .86, SEE = .13, P < .001 and HCM, K(1) = .89[MBF] + .03, r = .85, SEE = .12, P < .001).

Conclusion: [(11)C]acetate enables quantification of MBF in fairly good agreement with actual MBF in both healthy individuals and patients with HCM. A single tissue compartment model with standardized correction for recirculating metabolites and with corrections for partial volume and spillover provided the best results.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20039151/
Simplifications in analyzing positron emission tomography data: effects on outcome measures,"Jean Logan, David Alexoff, Aarti Kriplani","Initial validation studies of new radiotracers generally involve kinetic models that require a measured arterial input function. This allows for the separation of tissue binding from delivery and blood flow effects. However, when using a tracer in a clinical setting, it is necessary to eliminate arterial blood sampling due to its invasiveness and the extra burden of counting and analyzing the blood samples for metabolites. In some cases, it may also be necessary to replace dynamic scanning with a shortened scanning period some time after tracer injection, as is done with FDG (F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose). These approximations represent loss of information. In this work, we considered several questions related to this: (1) Do differences in experimental conditions (drug treatments) or populations affect the input function, and what effect, if any, does this have on the final outcome measure? (2) How do errors in metabolite measurements enter into results? (3) What errors are incurred if the uptake ratio is used in place of the distribution volume ratio? (4) Is one- or two-point blood sampling any better for FDG data than the standardized uptake value? and (5) If blood sampling is necessary, what alternatives are there to arterial blood sampling? The first three questions were considered in terms of data from human dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) studies under conditions of baseline and drug pretreatment. Data from [11C]raclopride studies and those from the norepinephrine transporter tracer (S,S)-[11C]O-methyl reboxetine were used. Calculation of a metabolic rate for FDG using the operational equation requires a measured input function. We tested a procedure based on two blood samples to estimate the plasma integral and convolution that occur in the operational equation. There are some tracers for which blood sampling is necessary. Strategies for brain studies involve using the internal carotids in estimating the radioactivity after correcting for partial volume and spillover in order to eliminate arterial sampling. Some venous blood samples are still required for metabolite measurements. The ultimate solution to the problem of arterial sampling may be a wrist scanner, which acts as a small PET camera for imaging the arteries in the wrist. This is currently under development.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17921027/
Off-line motion correction methods for multi-frame PET data,"Jurgen E M Mourik, Mark Lubberink, Floris H P van Velden, Adriaan A Lammertsma, Ronald Boellaard","Purpose: Patient motion during PET acquisition may affect measured time-activity curves, thereby reducing accuracy of tracer kinetic analyses. The aim of the present study was to evaluate different off-line frame-by-frame methods to correct patient motion, which is of particular interest when no optical motion tracking system is available or when older data sets have to be reanalysed.

Methods: Four different motion correction methods were evaluated. In the first method attenuation-corrected frames were realigned with the summed image of the first 3 min. The second method was identical, except that non-attenuation-corrected images were used. In the third and fourth methods non-attenuation-corrected images were realigned with standard and cupped transmission images, respectively. Two simulation studies were performed, based on [11C]flumazenil and (R)-[11C]PK11195 data sets, respectively. For both simulation studies different types (rotational, translational) and degrees of motion were added. Simulated PET scans were corrected for motion using all correction methods. The optimal method derived from these simulation studies was used to evaluate two (one with and one without visible movement) clinical data sets of [11C]flumazenil, (R)-[11C]PK11195 and [11C]PIB. For these clinical data sets, the volume of distribution (VT) was derived using Logan analysis and values were compared before and after motion correction.

Results: For both [11C]flumazenil and (R)-[11C]PK11195 simulation studies, optimal results were obtained when realignment was based on non-attenuation-corrected images. For the clinical data sets motion disappeared visually after motion correction. Regional differences of up to 433% in VT before and after motion correction were found for scans with visible movement. On the other hand, when no visual motion was present in the original data set, overall differences in VT before and after motion correction were <1.5 ± 1.3%.

Conclusion: Frame-by-frame motion correction using non-attenuation-corrected images improves the accuracy of tracer kinetic analysis compared to non-motion-corrected data.

"In Vivo Imaging of Human 11C-Metformin in Peripheral Organs: Dosimetry, Biodistribution, and Kinetic Analyses","Lars C Gormsen, Elias Immanuel Sundelin, Jonas Brorson Jensen, Mikkel Holm Vendelbo, Steen Jakobsen, Ole Lajord Munk, Mette Marie Hougaard Christensen, Kim Brøsen, Jørgen Frøkiær, Niels Jessen","Metformin is the most widely prescribed oral antiglycemic drug, with few adverse effects. However, surprisingly little is known about its human biodistribution and target tissue metabolism. In animal experiments, we have shown that metformin can be labeled by11C and that11C-metformin PET can be used to measure renal function. Here, we extend these preclinical findings by a first-in-human11C-metformin PET dosimetry, biodistribution, and tissue kinetics study.

Methods: Nine subjects (3 women and 6 men) participated in 2 studies: in the first study, human radiation dosimetry and biodistribution of11C-metformin were estimated in 4 subjects (2 women and 2 men) by whole-body PET. In the second study,11C-metformin tissue kinetics were measured in response to both intravenous and oral radiotracer administration. A dynamic PET scan with a field of view covering target tissues of metformin (liver, kidneys, intestines, and skeletal muscle) was obtained for 90 (intravenous) and 120 (oral) min.

Results: Radiation dosimetry was acceptable, with effective doses of 9.5 μSv/MBq (intravenous administration) and 18.1 μSv/MBq (oral administration). Whole-body PET revealed that11C-metformin was primarily taken up by the kidneys, urinary bladder, and liver but also to a lesser extent in salivary glands, skeletal muscle, and intestines. Reversible 2-tissue-compartment kinetics was observed in the liver, and volume of distribution was calculated to be 2.45 mL/mL (arterial input) or 2.66 mL/mL (portal and arterial input). In the kidneys, compartmental models did not adequately fit the experimental data, and volume of distribution was therefore estimated by a linear approach to be 6.83 mL/mL. Skeletal muscle and intestinal tissue kinetics were best described by 2-tissue-compartment kinetics and showed only discrete tracer uptake. Liver11C-metformin uptake was pronounced after oral administration of the tracer, with tissue-to-blood ratio double what was observed after intravenous administration. Only slow accumulation of11C-metformin was observed in muscle. There was no elimination of11C-metformin through the bile both during the intravenous and during the oral part of the study.

Conclusion: 11C-metformin is suitable for imaging metformin uptake in target tissues and may prove a valuable tool to assess the impact of metformin treatment in patients with varying metformin transport capacity.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27469359/
"Pharmacokinetic studies of [68 Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 in patients with biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer: detection, differences in temporal distribution and kinetic modelling by tissue type","Dimitrios S Strauss, C Sachpekidis, K Kopka, L Pan, U Haberkorn, A Dimitrakopoulou-Strauss","Purpose: [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 is a promising radiopharmaceutical for detecting tumour lesions in prostate cancer, but knowledge of the pharmacokinetics is limited. Dynamic PET-CT was performed to investigate the tumour detection and differences in temporal distribution, as well as in kinetic modelling of [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 by tissue type.

Methods: Dynamic PET-CT over the lower abdomen and static whole-body PET-CT 80-90 min p.i. from 142 patients with biochemical recurrence were retrospectively analysed. Detection rates were compared to PSA levels. Average time-activity curves were calculated from tumour lesions and normal tissue. A three-compartment model and non-compartment model were used to calculate tumour kinetics.

Results: Overall detection rate was 70.42%, and in patients with PSA > 0.4 ng/mL 76.67%. All tumour lesions presented the steepest standardised uptake value (SUV) incline in the first 7-8 min before decreasing to different degrees. Normal tissue presented with a low uptake, except for the bladder, which accumulated activity the steepest 15-16 min. p.i.. While all tumour lesions continuously increased, bone metastases showed the steepest decline, resulting in a significantly lower SUV than lymph node metastases (60 and 80-90 min). Transport rate from the blood and tracer binding and internalisation rate were lower in bone metastases. Heterogeneity (fractal dimension) and vascular density were significantly lower in bone metastases.

Conclusion: Even at low PSA between 0.51 and 0.99 ng/mL, detection rate was 57%. Dynamic imaging showed a time window in the first 10 min where tumour uptake is high, but no bladder activity is measured, aiding accuracy in distinction of local recurrence. Kinetic modelling provided additional information for tumour characterisation by tissue type.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34110436/
Image-derived input function in dynamic human PET/CT: methodology and validation with 11C-acetate and 18F-fluorothioheptadecanoic acid in muscle and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose in brain,"Etienne Croteau, Eric Lavallée, Sébastien M Labbe, Laurent Hubert, Fabien Pifferi, Jacques A Rousseau, Stephen C Cunnane, André C Carpentier, Roger Lecomte, François Bénard","Purpose: Despite current advances in PET/CT systems, blood sampling still remains the standard method to obtain the radiotracer input function for tracer kinetic modelling. The purpose of this study was to validate the use of image-derived input functions (IDIF) of the carotid and femoral arteries to measure the arterial input function (AIF) in PET imaging. The data were obtained from two different research studies, one using (18)F-FDG for brain imaging and the other using (11)C-acetate and (18)F-fluoro-6-thioheptadecanoic acid ((18)F-FTHA) in femoral muscles.

Methods: The method was validated with two phantom systems. First, a static phantom consisting of syringes of different diameters containing radioactivity was used to determine the recovery coefficient (RC) and spill-in factors. Second, a dynamic phantom built to model bolus injection and clearance of tracers was used to establish the correlation between blood sampling, AIF and IDIF. The RC was then applied to the femoral artery data from PET imaging studies with (11)C-acetate and (18)F-FTHA and to carotid artery data from brain imaging with (18)F-FDG. These IDIF data were then compared to actual AIFs from patients.

Results: With (11)C-acetate, the perfusion index in the femoral muscle was 0.34+/-0.18 min(-1) when estimated from the actual time-activity blood curve, 0.29+/-0.15 min(-1) when estimated from the corrected IDIF, and 0.66+/-0.41 min(-1) when the IDIF data were not corrected for RC. A one-way repeated measures (ANOVA) and Tukey's test showed a statistically significant difference for the IDIF not corrected for RC (p<0.0001). With (18)F-FTHA there was a strong correlation between Patlak slopes, the plasma to tissue transfer rate calculated using the true plasma radioactivity content and the corrected IDIF for the femoral muscles (vastus lateralis r=0.86, p=0.027; biceps femoris r=0.90, p=0.017). On the other hand, there was no correlation between the values derived using the AIF and those derived using the uncorrected IDIF. Finally, in the brain imaging study with (18)F-FDG, the cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (CMRglc) measured using the uncorrected IDIF was consistently overestimated. The CMRglc obtained using blood sampling was 13.1+/-3.9 mg/100 g per minute and 14.0+/-5.7 mg/100 g per minute using the corrected IDIF (r ( 2 )=0.90).

Conclusion: Correctly obtained, carotid and femoral artery IDIFs can be used as a substitute for AIFs to perform tracer kinetic modelling in skeletal femoral muscles and brain analyses.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20437239/
Positron emission tomography in experimental perinatology,"B S Lindberg, L Berglund, P Hartvig, P G Lindgren, A Lilja, H Lundqvist, B Långström, A Rane","Positron emission tomography (PET) is a new tracer technique by which short-lived radionuclides, such as 11C are used for labeling drugs, amino acids and other compounds. The concentration in the various organs is determined non-invasively after I.V. injection. Positrons, emitted by 11C attract an electron, and the two masses are annihilated by emitting photons. These can be registered by external detectors. Measurement of the radioactivity per volume of tissue as a function of time is accomplished by computerized processing of the data. The PET technique may be used for studies of the kinetics of the injected compound in different organs of the body. However, PET registers only the total radioactivity meaning that the measured 11C-radioactivity represents the sum of the parent compound and the radiolabelled metabolites. Chemical and radiochemical analyses in various body fluids may then help to interpret the PET images.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3878868/
Optimal duration of PET studies with 18F-fluoroethyl-diprenorphine,"Henning Boecker, Till Sprenger, Gjermund Henriksen, Thomas R Toelle, Mary E Spilker","The tracer 6-O-(2-(18)F-fluoroethyl)-6-O-desmethyldiprenorphine (18F-FDPN) provides enhanced flexibility to PET studies of the opioidergic system because the label has a longer half-life than the label of 11C-diprenorphine. Here we evaluated the ideal length of PET studies with 18F-FDPN.

Methods: 18F-FDPN binding kinetics were quantified with protocols of different lengths by use of a 1-tissue or a 2-tissue compartment model for different volumes of interest. Furthermore, the effects of scanning duration were assessed by parametric analyses.

Results: A 90-min protocol resulted in less than 10% bias in distribution volume (DV) relative to the full-length protocol. Correlation analyses of the DV estimates for the full-length protocol and the shortened protocols showed good replication of DV estimates for regions with both low and high levels of binding at schedules of up to 90 min.

Conclusion: Data sampling in dynamic 18F-FDPN PET acquisitions should not be shorter than 90 min to maintain reliable estimates of DV.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16330575/
Study of direct and indirect parametric estimation methods of linear models in dynamic positron emission tomography,"Charalampos Tsoumpas, Federico E Turkheimer, Kris Thielemans","In dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) studies, the time changing activity of the radiotracer is measured through multiple consecutive frames. Subsequent pixel-by-pixel application of the appropriate kinetic model provides quantitative information in terms of images of the distribution of the physiological parameter of interest. In this context, iterative reconstruction methods may be used to reconstruct for each time frame a static image of appreciable higher quality than the analytical algorithms, especially in low-count cases. Furthermore, if the reconstruction algorithm also models the kinetics of the measured counts, the parametric image is expected to be of even higher quality. In this work, we investigate the methodology to directly reconstruct parametric images in three-dimensional PET when the kinetic model is linear in its parameters (Patlak plot) and compare with indirectly estimated parametric maps, where the radioactivity distribution was estimated by the filtered back projection and ordered subsets expectation maximization algorithms. Both real and simulated data for tracers with irreversible kinetics in brain studies are included. The results demonstrate appreciable smaller standard deviation and mean squared error characteristics for the direct reconstruction. However, some regions may converge slowly. The FBP and ordered subsets expectation maximization (OSEM) indirect estimations have a similar level of bias after matching their resolutions, but OSEM has smaller standard deviation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18491524/
Assessment of muscarinic receptor concentrations in aging and Alzheimer disease with [11C]NMPB and PET,"J K Zubieta, R A Koeppe, K A Frey, M R Kilbourn, T J Mangner, N L Foster, D E Kuhl","Cerebral cholinergic deficits have been described in Alzheimer disease (AD) and as a result of normal aging. At the present time, there are very limited options for the quantification of cholinergic receptors with in vivo imaging techniques such as PET. In the present study, we examined the feasibility of utilizing [11C]N-methyl-4-piperidyl benzilate (NMPB), a nonselective muscarinic receptor ligand, in the study of aging and neurodegenerative processes associated with cholinergic dysfunction. Based on prior data describing the accuracy of various kinetic methods, we examined the concentration of muscarinic receptors with [11C]NMPB and PET using two- and three-compartment kinetic models. Eighteen healthy subjects and six patients diagnosed with probable AD were studied. Pixel-by-pixel two-compartment model fits showed acceptable precision in the study of normal aging, with comparable results to those obtained with a more complex and less precise three-compartment model. Normal aging was associated with a reduction in muscarinic receptor binding in neocortical regions and thalamus. In AD patients, the three-compartment model appeared capable of dissociating changes in tracer transport from changes in receptor binding, but suffered from statistical uncertainty, requiring normalization to a reference region, and therefore limiting its potential use in the study of neurodegenerative processes. After normalization, no regional changes in muscarinic receptor concentrations were observed in AD.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11169777/
Signal extraction and separation in in vivo animal PET studies with masked volumewise principal-component analysis,"Fredrik Engbrant, Azita Monazzam, Per-Edvin Svensson, Johan Olsson, Ewert Bengtsson, Pasha Razifar","The standardized uptake value is commonly used as a tool to supplement visual interpretation and to quantify the images acquired from static in vivo animal PET. The preferred approach for analyzing PET data is either to sum the images and calculate the standardized uptake value or to use kinetic modeling. The aim of this study was to investigate the performance of masked volumewise principal-component analysis (MVW-PCA) used in dynamic in vivo animal PET studies to extract and separate signals with different kinetic behaviors.

Methods: PET data were acquired with a small-animal PET scanner and a fluorine tracer in a study of rats and mice. After acquisition, the data were reconstructed by use of 4 time protocols with different frame lengths. Data were analyzed by use of MVW-PCA with applied noise prenormalization and a new masking technique developed in this study.

Results: The resulting principal-component images showed a clear separation of the activity in the spine into the first MVW-PCA component and the activity in the kidneys into the second MVW-PCA component. In addition, the different time protocols were shown to have little or no impact on the results obtained with MVW-PCA.

Conclusion: MVW-PCA can efficiently separate different kinetic behaviors into different principal-component images. Moreover, MVW-PCA is a stable technique in the sense that the time protocol chosen has only a small impact on the resulting principal-component images.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20484179/
18F-FDG kinetics and gene expression in giant cell tumors,"Ludwig G Strauss, Antonia Dimitrakopoulou-Strauss, Dirk Koczan, Ludger Bernd, Uwe Haberkorn, Volker Ewerbeck, Hans-Jürgen Thiesen","18F-FDG kinetics were evaluated by use of compartment and noncompartment models of giant cell tumors. The kinetic data were compared with the gene expression data for a subgroup of patients.

Methods: Nineteen patients with giant cell tumors were examined with PET and 18F-FDG, and tracer kinetics were assessed quantitatively. A 2-compartment model, including the transport constants k1-k4 as well as the vascular fraction (VB) for 18F-FDG, was used for evaluation of the data. A noncompartment model was used to calculate the fractal dimension of the 18F-FDG time-activity curve to assess the heterogeneity of the tracer kinetics. Furthermore, tumor specimens obtained from 5 patients were assessed with gene chip technology (U95A), and these data were compared with the quantitative 18F-FDG data.

Results: The giant cell tumors showed generally enhanced 18F-FDG uptake 1 h after tracer application, with a mean 18F-FDG standardized uptake value (SUV) of 4.8 (range, 1.8-9.4). Quantitative evaluation of tracer kinetics showed a preferential increase for 18F-FDG transport, with a mean k1 of 0.340. The vascular fraction accounted for 35% of the tumor volume and was high compared with those for other tumors, such as soft-tissue sarcomas. 18F-FDG kinetics were heterogeneous, with a fractal dimension of 1.3. Gene chip analysis showed that the expression of 137 genes (1.1%) exceeded the median expression value of the reference gene, beta2-microglobulin. The highest expression was observed for the gene for the small, leucine-rich proteoglycan I (biglycan), which is important for bone cell differentiation and proliferative activity. Correlation analysis revealed an association of 18F-FDG data with the expression of several genes. Mainly genes related to angiogenesis were associated with the compartment parameters. The SUV at 56-60 min was correlated with the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor A (angiogenesis) and cell division cycle 2 protein (proliferation).

Conclusion: Despite their classification as benign tumors, giant cell tumors have generally enhanced 18F-FDG uptake, mainly attributable to an enhanced vascular fraction and increased 18F-FDG transport. A comparison of gene chip data and 18F-FDG kinetic data showed a close association of quantitative 18F-FDG results and the expression of genes related to angiogenesis.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15347720/

Direct 4D PET reconstruction with discrete tissue types,Michele Scipioni,"Dynamic positron emission tomography (dPET) is known for its ability to extract spatiotemporal information of a radio tracer in living tissue. In this paper, a novel direct reconstruction framework is presented, which include concurrent clustering as a potential aid in addressing high levels of noise typical of voxel-wise kinetic modeling. Core assumption is that the imaged volume is formed by a finite number of different functional regions, and that voxel-wise time courses are determined by the functional cluster they belong to. Probabilistic Graphical Modeling (PGM) theory is used to describe the problem, and to derive the inference strategy. The proposed iterative estimation scheme provides concurrent estimate of kinetic parameter maps, activity images, and segmented clusters. Simulation studies and exploratory application to real data are performed to validate the proposal.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31946945/
Searching for diagnostic properties of novel fluorine-18-labeled D-allose,"Jun Toyohara, Hiroyuki Yamamoto, Tetsuro Tago","Objective: Two fluorine-18-labeled analogues, 3-deoxy-3-[18F]fluoro-D-allose (3-[18F]FDA) and 6-deoxy-6-[18F]fluoro-D-allose (6-[18F]FDA), were synthesized and their potentials of diagnostic property were characterized.

Methods: In vitro rat red blood cell (RBC) transport and phosphorylation by yeast hexokinase were evaluated in comparison with 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose ([18F]FDG). The rate of protein binding in pooled human serum was measured by an ultrafiltration method. In vivo metabolite analysis in mice was also performed. Biodistribution, urine excretion, and in vivo renal kinetics in mice were compared with 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluorosorbitol ([18F]FDS).

Results: Rat RBC uptake of 3- and 6-[18F]FDA (7.8 ± 2.5%ID and 10.2 ± 4.8%ID, respectively) was significantly lower than that of [18F]FDG (44.7 ± 8.7%ID). RBC uptake of 3-[18F]FDA was inhibited by D-glucose (30%) and cytochalasin B (40%), indicating the involvement of GLUT1-dependent transport. In contrast, 6-[18F]FDA transport was not inhibited by D-glucose and cytochalasin B. 3- and 6-[18F]FDA were not phosphorylated by yeast hexokinase under the conditions that result in 60% conversion of [18F]FDG into [18F]FDG-6-phosphate within 30 min. Serum protein binding of 3- and 6-[18F]FDA was negligible. Metabolic transformation of both tracers was not detected in plasma and urine at 30 min after injection. The highest tissue uptake of both tracers was observed in kidneys. Heart and brain uptake of both tracers was below blood levels throughout the biodistribution studies (until 120 min after injection). No significant uptake in the bone was observed, indicating the absence of de-fluorination in mice. In vivo PET imaging visualized rapid excretion of the administered 3- and 6-[18F]FDA from the kidneys, with minimal tracer accumulation in other organs. The urine excretion rate of 3-[18F]FDA was much lower than that of 6-[18F]FDA and [18F]FDS.

Conclusions: 3- and 6-[18F]FDA might be unsatisfactory for tumor imaging. In contrast, these tracers demonstrated high levels of kidney uptake and excretion, low serum protein binding, and high metabolic stability as preferable properties for renal imaging. Notably, the urine excretion rate and kidney uptake kinetics of 6-[18F]FDA were comparable with those of the potential renal imaging agent [18F]FDS. Further validation studies in animal models are required to confirm the feasibility of 6-[18F]FDA as a functional renal imaging agent.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31471865/
Modeling kinetics of infused 13NN-saline in acute lung injury,"K O'Neill, J G Venegas, T Richter, R S Harris, J D H Layfield, G Musch, T Winkler, M F Vidal Melo","A mathematical model was developed to estimate right-to-left shunt (Fs) and the volume of distribution of 13NN in alveolar gas (VA) and shunt tissue (Vs). The data obtained from this model are complementary to, and obtained simultaneously with, pulmonary functional positron emission tomography (PET). The model describes 13NN kinetics in four compartments: central mixing volume, gas-exchanging lung, shunting compartment, and systemic recirculation. To validate the model, five normal prone (NP) and six surfactant-depleted sheep in the supine (LS) and prone (LP) positions were studied under general anesthesia. A central venous bolus of 13NN-labeled saline was injected at the onset of apnea as PET imaging and arterial 13NN sampling were initiated. The model fit the tracer kinetics well (mean r2 = 0.93). Monte Carlo simulations showed that parameters could be accurately identified in the presence of expected experimental noise. Fs derived from the model correlated well with shunt estimates derived from O2 blood concentrations and from PET images. Fs was higher for LS (54 +/- 18%) than for LP (5 +/- 4%) and NP (1 +/- 1%, P < 0.01). VA, as a fraction of PET-measured lung gas volume, was lower for LS (0.18 +/- 0.09) than for LP (0.96 +/- 0.28, P < 0.01), whereas Vs, as a fraction of PET-measured lung tissue volume, was higher for LS (0.46 +/- 0.26) than for LP (0.05 +/- 0.08, P < 0.01). The main conclusions are as follows: 1) the model accurately describes measured arterial 13NN kinetics and provides estimates of Fs, and 2) in this animal model of acute lung injury, the fraction of available gas volume participating in gas exchange is reduced in the supine position.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12897030/
Dynamic small-animal PET imaging of tumor proliferation with 3'-deoxy-3'-18F-fluorothymidine in a genetically engineered mouse model of high-grade gliomas,"Michelle S Bradbury, Dolores Hambardzumyan, Pat B Zanzonico, Jazmin Schwartz, Shangde Cai, Eva M Burnazi, Valerie Longo, Steven M Larson, Eric C Holland","3'-Deoxy-3'-(18)F-fluorothymidine ((18)F-FLT), a partially metabolized thymidine analog, has been used in preclinical and clinical settings for the diagnostic evaluation and therapeutic monitoring of tumor proliferation status. We investigated the use of (18)F-FLT for detecting and characterizing genetically engineered mouse (GEM) high-grade gliomas and evaluating the pharmacokinetics in GEM gliomas and normal brain tissue. Our goal was to develop a robust and reproducible method of kinetic analysis for the quantitative evaluation of tumor proliferation.

Methods: Dynamic (18)F-FLT PET imaging was performed for 60 min in glioma-bearing mice (n = 10) and in non-tumor-bearing control mice (n = 4) by use of a dedicated small-animal PET scanner. A 3-compartment, 4-parameter model was used to characterize (18)F-FLT kinetics in vivo. For compartmental analysis, the arterial input was measured by placing a region of interest over the left ventricular blood pool and was corrected for partial-volume averaging. The (18)F-FLT ""trapping"" and tissue flux model parameters were correlated with measured uptake (percentage injected dose per gram [%ID/g]) values at 60 min.

Results: (18)F-FLT uptake values (%ID/g) at 1 h in brain tumors were significantly greater than those in control brains (mean +/- SD: 4.33 +/- 0.58 and 0.86 +/- 0.22, respectively; P < 0.0004). Kinetic analyses of the measured time-activity curves yielded independent, robust estimates of tracer transport and metabolism, with compartmental model-derived time-activity data closely fitting the measured data. Except for tracer transport, statistically significant differences were found between the applicable model parameters for tumors and normal brains. The tracer retention rate constant strongly correlated with measured (18)F-FLT uptake values (r = 0.85, P < 0.0025), whereas a more moderate correlation was found between net (18)F-FLT flux and (18)F-FLT uptake values (r = 0.61, P < 0.02).

Conclusion: A clinically relevant mouse glioma model was characterized by both static and dynamic small-animal PET imaging of (18)F-FLT uptake. Time-activity curves were kinetically modeled to distinguish early transport from a subsequent tracer retention phase. Estimated (18)F-FLT rate constants correlated positively with %ID/g measurements. Dynamic evaluation of (18)F-FLT uptake offers a promising approach for noninvasively assessing cellular proliferation in vivo and for quantitatively monitoring new antiproliferation therapies.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18287265/
Visualization and quantification of neurokinin-1 (NK1) receptors in the human brain,"Jarmo Hietala, Mikko J Nyman, Olli Eskola, Aki Laakso, Tove Grönroos, Vesa Oikonen, Jörgen Bergman, Merja Haaparanta, Sarita Forsback, Päivi Marjamäki, Pertti Lehikoinen, Michael Goldberg, Donald Burns, Terence Hamill, Wai-Si Eng, Alexandre Coimbra, Richard Hargreaves, Olof Solin","Purpose: This study was conducted to develop a new positron emission tomography (PET) method to visualize neurokinin-1 (NK(1)) receptor systems in the human brain in vivo in order to examine their neuroanatomical distribution and facilitate investigations of the role of substance P, NK(1) receptors, and NK(1) receptor antagonists in central nervous system (CNS) function and dysfunction.

Methods: PET studies were conducted in 10 healthy male volunteers using a novel selective, high-affinity NK(1) receptor antagonist labeled with fluorine-18 to very high specific radioactivity (up to 2000 GBq/micromol) [F-18]SPA-RQ. Data were collected in 3D mode for greatest sensitivity. Different modeling methods were compared and regional receptor distributions determined for comparison with in vitro autoradiographic studies using postmortem human brain slices with [F-18]SPA-RQ.

Results: The studies showed that the highest uptake of [F-18]SPA-RQ was observed in the caudate and putamen. Lower binding was found in globus pallidus and substantia nigra. [F-18]SPA-RQ uptake was also widespread throughout the neocortex and limbic cortex including amygdala and hippocampus. There was very low specific uptake of the tracer in the cerebellar cortex. The distribution pattern was confirmed using in vitro receptor autoradiography with [F-18]SPA-RQ on postmortem human brain slices. Kinetic modeling of the [F-18]SPA-RQ uptake data indicated a binding potential between 4 and 5 in the basal ganglia and between 1.5 and 2.5 in the cortical regions.

Conclusions: [F-18]SPA-RQ is a novel tool for exploration of the functions of NK(1) receptors in man. [F-18]SPA-RQ can be used to define receptor pharmacodynamics and focus dose selection of novel NK(1) receptor antagonists in clinical trials thereby ensuring adequate proof of concept testing particularly in therapeutic applications related to CNS dysfunction.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16155744/
Cumulative input function method for linear compartmental models and spectral analysis in PET,"Urban Simoncic, Robert Jeraj","Compartmental modeling and spectral analysis are often used for tracer kinetic modeling in positron emission tomography (PET). The concentrations in kinetic equations are usually considered to be instantaneous, whereas PET data are inherently integrated over time, which leads to uncertainties in the results. A new formalism for kinetic analysis that uses cumulative tracer concentrations and avoids approximating the image-derived input function and PET measurements with midframe instantanous values was developed. We assessed the improvements of the new formalism over the midframe approximation methods for three commonly used radiopharmaceuticals: [(11)C]raclopride, 2'-deoxy-2'-[(18)F]fluoro-D-glucose (FDG), and 3'-deoxy-3'-[(18)F]fluoro-thymidine (FLT). We found that improvements are case dependent and often not negligible. Improvements for determination of binding potential for [(11)C]raclopride ranged from 5% to 25%. Improvements in estimation accuracy of FDG and FLT microparameters ranged up to 25%. On the other hand, estimation of macroparameter K(i)=K(1)k(3)/(k(2)+k(3)) for FDG or FLT did not show significant benefit with the new method; only modest improvement up to 2% was observed. Assessment of the benefits of using new method is far from being exhaustive, but possibly significant improvement was demonstrated. Therefore, we consider the proposed algorithm a necessary component of any kinetic analysis software.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20808319/
"Evaluation of [18F]MC225 as a PET radiotracer for measuring P-glycoprotein function at the blood-brain barrier in rats: Kinetics, metabolism, and selectivity","Heli Savolainen, Albert D Windhorst, Philip H Elsinga, Mariangela Cantore, Nicola A Colabufo, Antoon Tm Willemsen, Gert Luurtsema","P-glycoprotein is a protective efflux transporter at the blood-brain barrier showing altered function in many neurological disorders. The purpose of this study was to validate [18F]MC225 as a radiotracer for measuring P-glycoprotein function with positron emission tomography. Three groups of Sprague-Dawley rats were used to assess tracer uptake at baseline (group 1), after inhibition of P-glycoprotein (group 2), and after inhibition of both P-glycoprotein and breast cancer resistance protein (Bcrp, group 3). A two-tissue compartment model with a metabolite-corrected plasma input function provided the best fit to the positron emission tomography data, but parameter estimates were more reliable in a one-tissue compartment model, which was selected as the preferred model. Regional distribution volumes ( VT) in the control group ranged from 6 to 11, which is higher than for other radiotracers. [18F]MC225 showed transporter selectivity, since inhibition of P-glycoprotein caused a two to fourfold increase in the cerebral VTvalues, but additional inhibition of Bcrp did not cause any further increase. Metabolic stability of [18F]MC225 was moderate (at 1 h post-injection 15% of plasma radioactivity and 76% of brain radioactivity represented intact parent). Thus, [18F]MC225 may be a useful radiotracer to measure especially increases of P-glycoprotein function at the blood-brain barrier.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27354093/
A pitfall of white matter reference regions used in [18F] florbetapir PET: a consideration of kinetics,"Masashi Kameyama, Kenji Ishibash, Kei Wagatsuma, Jun Toyohara, Kenji Ishii","Objective: Many studies have demonstrated the superiority of white matter (WM) reference regions (RR) in amyloid PET studies in comparison to cerebellar RR. However, the principle behind its improved measurement stability is yet to be elucidated. Our study aimed to determine the origin of WM stability; stability over cerebral blood flow and input function fluctuation or the greater statistical noise in the cerebellum due to its smaller size and its location in the axial periphery of the PET scanner bore.

Methods: We conducted simulations of [[Formula: see text]F] florbetapir using in-house program varying [Formula: see text] and input function, and adding statistical noise.

Results: Our simulations revealed that WM RR were more susceptible to CBF variation and input function fluctuation than cerebellar RR. WM RR did not gave superior measurement stability unless cerebellar statistical noise exceeded 4.55 times that in WM, a figure often surpassed in traditional amyloid PET studies. The greater statistical noise in cerebellum is likely the etiology for improved measurement stability of WM RR.

Conclusion: A longitudinal [[Formula: see text]F] florbetapir PET study should be conducted with a long bore PET. It can also be hypothesized that a second scan with the cerebellum in the axial center of a 3D PET, using a cerebellar RR to calculate changes in tracer concentration may improve the measurement stability of longitudinal [[Formula: see text]F] florbetapir studies.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31456012/
Comparison between 68Ga-bombesin (68Ga-BZH3) and the cRGD tetramer 68Ga-RGD4 studies in an experimental nude rat model with a neuroendocrine pancreatic tumor cell line,"Caixia Cheng, Leyun Pan, Antonia Dimitrakopoulou-Strauss, Martin Schäfer, Carmen Wängler, Björn Wängler, Uwe Haberkorn, Ludwig G Strauss","Objectives: Receptor scintigraphy gains more interest for diagnosis and treatment of tumors, in particular for neuroendocrine tumors (NET). We used a pan-Bombesin analog, the peptide DOTA-PEG2-[D-tyr6, β-Ala11, Thi13, Nle14] BN(6-14) amide (BZH3). BZH3 binds to at least three receptor subtypes: the BB1 (Neuromedin B), BB2 (Gastrin-releasing peptide, GRP), and BB3. Imaging of ανβ3 integrin expression playing an important role in angiogenesis and metastasis was accomplished with a 68Ga-RGD tetramer. The purpose of this study was to investigate the kinetics and to compare both tracers in an experimental NET cell line.

Methods: This study comprised nine nude rats inoculated with the pancreatic tumor cell line AR42J. Dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) scans using 68Ga-BZH3 and 68Ga-RGD tetramer were performed (68Ga-RGD tetramer: n = 4, 68Ga-BZH3: n = 5). Standardized uptake values (SUVs) were calculated, and a two-tissue compartmental learning-machine model (calculation of K1 - k4 vessel density (VB) and receptor binding potential (RBP)) as well as a non-compartmental model based on the fractal dimension was used for quantitative analysis of both tracers. Multivariate analysis was used to evaluate the kinetic data.

Results: The PET kinetic parameters showed significant differences when individual parameters were compared between groups. Significant differences were found in FD, VB, K1, and RBP (p = 0.0275, 0.05, 0.05, and 0.0275 respectively). The 56- to 60-min SUV for 68Ga-BZH3, with a range of 0.86 to 1.29 (median, 1.19) was higher than the corresponding value for the 68Ga-RGD tetramer, with a range of 0.78 to 1.31 (median, 0.99). Furthermore, FD, VB, K1, and RBP for 68Ga-BZH3 were generally higher than the corresponding values for the 68Ga-RGD tetramer, whereas k3 was slightly higher for 68Ga-RGD tetramer.

Conclusions: As a parameter that reflects receptor binding, the increase of K1 for 68Ga-BZH3 indicated higher expression of bombesin receptors than that of the ανβ3 integrin in neuroendocrine tumors. 68Ga-BZH3 seems better suited for diagnosis of NETs owing to higher global tracer uptake.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22214362/
"Comparative evaluation in nonhuman primates of five PET radiotracers for imaging the serotonin transporters: [11C]McN 5652, [11C]ADAM, [11C]DASB, [11C]DAPA, and [11C]AFM","Yiyun Huang, Dah-Ren Hwang, Raj Narendran, Yasuhiko Sudo, Rano Chatterjee, Sung-A Bae, Osama Mawlawi, Lawrence S Kegeles, Alan A Wilson, Hank F Kung, Marc Laruelle","The recent introduction of a number of new radiotracers suitable for imaging the serotonin transporters (SERT) has radically changed the field of SERT imaging. Whereas, until recently, only one selective SERT radiotracer was available ([11C]McN 5652) for SERT imaging with positron emission tomography (PET), several new C-11-labeled radiotracers of the -dimethyl-2-(arylthio)benzylamine class have been described as appropriate imaging agents for the SERT. The aim of this study was to conduct a comparative evaluation of four of the most promising agents in this class ([11C]ADAM, [11C]DASB, [11C]DAPA, and [11C]AFM) with the reference tracer [11C]McN 5652 under standardized experimental conditions. This evaluation included in vitro measurements of affinity and lipophilicity, and in vivo PET imaging experiments in baboons. In vitro, DASB displayed significantly lower affinity for SERT than the other four tracers. In the blood, [11C]DASB and [11C]AFM display faster clearance and higher free fractions. Brain uptake was analyzed with kinetic modeling using a one-tissue compartment model and the metabolite-corrected arterial input function. The kinetic uptake of [11C]DASB was significantly faster compared with the other compounds, and the scan duration required to derive time-independent estimates of regional distribution volumes was shorter. [11C]DAPA exhibited the slowest brain kinetic. Regional-specific-to-nonspecific equilibrium partition coefficient (V3"") was the highest for [11C]AFM, followed by [11C]DASB and [11C]DAPA, which in turn provided higher V3"" values than [11C]ADAM and [11C]McN 5652. From these experiments, two ligands emerged as superior radiotracers that provide a significant improvement over [11C]McN 5652 for PET imaging of SERT: [11C]DASB, because it enables the measurement of SERT availability in a shorter scanning time, and [11C]AFM, because its higher signal-to-noise ratios provide a more reliable measurement of SERT availability in brain regions with relatively low density of SERT, such as in the limbic system.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12439295/
Improved delineation of human dopamine receptors using [18F]-N-methylspiroperidol and PET,"C D Arnett, A P Wolf, C Y Shiue, J S Fowler, R R MacGregor, D R Christman, M R Smith","The brain uptake of [18F]-N-methylspiroperidol, a butyrophenone neuroleptic with high selectivity for the dopamine receptor, has been measured in three normal human volunteers using positron emission tomography for times up to 12 hr postinjection. These studies demonstrated two unique findings concerning the in vivo distribution of this neuroleptic: (a) it is tightly bound to dopamine D-2 receptors in the caudate-putamen brain regions, and (b) these regions are the only large brain structures which exhibit appreciable long-term retention. In addition, radioactivity clears rapidly from plasma, and the percentage of unchanged [18F]-N-methylspiroperidol in plasma declines rapidly. These results suggest that this compound binds irreversibly to dopamine D-2 receptors, and that there are few if any dopamine D-2 receptors in the human frontal cortex. These studies emphasize not only the importance of characterizing neurotransmitter receptors in living human brain using a ligand labeled with a positron emitting nuclide of sufficiently long half-life to allow monitoring of brain radioactivity distribution for several hours after the injection of radioligand, but also of accurately determining the amount of unchanged tracer in plasma for tracer kinetic modeling.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3491193/
Estimation of regional bone metabolism from whole-body 18F-fluoride PET static images,"Musib Siddique, Glen M Blake, Michelle L Frost, Amelia E B Moore, Tanuj Puri, Paul K Marsden, Ignac Fogelman","Purpose: We evaluate a new quantitative method of acquiring and analysing (18)F positron emission tomography (PET) studies that enables regional bone plasma clearance (K ( i )) to be estimated from static scans acquired at multiple sites in the skeleton following a single injection of tracer.

Methods: Dynamic lumbar spine (18)F PET data from two clinical trials were used to simulate a series of static scans acquired 30-60 min after injection. Venous blood samples were taken at 30, 40, 50 and 60 min and K ( i ) evaluated by Patlak analysis and the static scan method. The data were used to evaluate the precision errors of the Patlak and static scan methods expressed as the percentage coefficient of variation (%CV) and compare their response to 6 months of treatment with the bone anabolic agent teriparatide.

Results: Static scan K ( i ) measurements 30-60 min after injection were highly correlated with the Patlak results (r > 0.99). The %CV for the static scan method was 17.5% 30 min after injection, decreasing to 14.5% at 60 min, compared with 13.0% for Patlak analysis. Response to teriparatide treatment was +25.2% for the static scan method compared with +24.3% for Patlak analysis. The mean ratio (SD) of the static scan and Patlak K ( i ) results was 1.006 (0.015) at 30 min after injection decreasing to 0.965 (0.015) at 60 min.

Conclusion: (18)F-Fluoride bone plasma clearance can be estimated from a static scan and venous blood samples acquired 30-60 min after injection. The method enables K ( i ) to be estimated at multiple skeletal sites with a single injection of tracer.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22065012/
Taking cyclotron 68Ga production to the next level: Expeditious solid target production of 68Ga for preparation of radiotracers,"Bryce J B Nelson, John Wilson, Susan Richter, M John M Duke, Melinda Wuest, Frank Wuest","Introduction: Gallium-68 is an important radionuclide for positron emission tomography (PET) with steadily increasing applications of68Ga-based radiopharmaceuticals for clinical use. Current68Ga sources are primarily68Ge/68Ga-generators, along with successful attempts of68Ga production using a cyclotron. This study evaluated cyclotron68Ga production and automated separation using expeditiously manufactured solid targets, demonstrates an order of magnitude improvement in yield compared to68Ge/68Ga generators, and presents a convenient alternative to existing cyclotron production processes. A comparison of radiolabeling and preclinical PET imaging was performed with both cyclotron and generator produced68Ga.

Methods: 100 mg enriched68Zn (99.3%68Zn, 0.48%67Zn, 0.1%66Zn) pellets pressed on silver discs were bombarded for 20-75 min using 12.5 MeV proton beam energies and 10-30 μA currents.68Ga was separated using an automated TRASIS AllinOne synthesizer employing AG 50W-X8 and UTEVA resins. Post-separation recovery of the68Zn by electrolysis yielded 76.7 ± 4.3%. Radionuclidic purity of cyclotron-produced68Ga was investigated with gamma spectroscopy using a HPGe-detector. Radiolabeling was investigated using the macrocyclic chelator DOTA and the bombesin-derived peptide NOTA-BBN2. PET imaging was performed using [68Ga]Ga-NOTA-BBN2 in a PC3 xenograft model.

Results: 600 μA·min fresh and recycled quadruplet68Zn target irradiations (n = 8) at 12.5 MeV and 30 μA yielded 13.9 ± 1.0 GBq68Ga; 2200 μA·min irradiations (n = 3) yielded 37.5 ± 1.9 GBq68Ga. HPGe analysis showed EOB 0.0074% and 0.0084% of total activity of66Ga and67Ga, respectively. Metal impurities were 0.06 ± 0.03 μg/GBq Zn, 0.13 ± 0.007 μg/GBq Fe, and 0.02 ± 0.01 μg/GBq Al for cyclotron68Ga. Cyclotron and68Ge/68Ga generator68Ga respective DOTA and NOTA-BBN2 labeling incorporations were 99.4 ± 0.0% and 99.3 ± 0.2%, and 90.4 ± 1.5% and 93.0 ± 3.6% determined by radio-thin layer chromatography (radio-TLC). Preclinical PET imaging comparison between generator and cyclotron produced68Ga showed identical radiotracer tumor uptake and biodistribution profiles in PC3 tumor bearing mice.

Conclusions: Cyclotron68Ga production provides highly scalable production with equivalent or superior quality68Ga to a68Ge/68Ga generator, while providing identical biodistribution and tumor uptake profiles. Our described targetry is simpler and more cost-effective than existing liquid and solid targetry, enabling a turnkey production system for multi-facility distribution of cyclotron produced68Ga. The manufacturing simplicity described has potential applications for producing other radiometals such as44Sc.

Advances in knowledge and implications for patient care: Our cost-effective method of solid target68Ga production can enhance68Ga production capabilities to meet the high demand for68Ga-radiopharmaceuticals for research and clinical use.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32004935/
"Regional distribution and kinetics of [18F]fluciclovine (anti-[18F]FACBC), a tracer of amino acid transport, in subjects with primary prostate cancer","Jens Sörensen, Rikard Owenius, Michelle Lax, Silvia Johansson","Purpose: [(18)F]Fluciclovine (anti-[(18)F]FACBC) is a synthetic amino acid developed for PET assessment of the anabolic component of tumour metabolism in clinical routine. This phase 1 trial evaluated the safety, tracer stability and uptake kinetics of [(18)F]fluciclovine in patients.

Methods: Six patients with biopsy-proven prostate cancer were investigated with 3-T MRI and PET/CT. All underwent dynamic [(18)F]fluciclovine PET/CT of the pelvic area for up to 120 min after injection of 418 ± 10 MBq of tracer with simultaneous blood sampling of radioactivity. The kinetics of uptake in tumours and normal tissues were evaluated using standardized uptake values (SUVs) and compartmental modelling.

Results: Tumour deposits as defined by MRI were clearly visualized by PET. Urine excretion was minimal and normal tissue background was low. Uptake of [(18)F]fluciclovine in tumour from the blood was rapid and the tumour-to-normal tissue contrast was highest between 1 and 15 min after injection with a 65 % reduction in mean tumour uptake at 90 min after injection. A one-compartment model fitted the tracer kinetics well. Early SUVs correlated well with both the influx rate constant (K (1)) and the volume of distribution of the tracer (V (T)). There were no signs of tracer metabolite formation. The product was well tolerated in all patients without significant adverse events.

Conclusion: [(18)F]Fluciclovine shows high uptake in prostate cancer deposits and appears safe for use in humans. The production is robust and the formulation stable in vivo. An early imaging window seems to provide the best visual results. SUV measurements capture most of the kinetic information that can be obtained from more advanced models, potentially simplifying quantification in future studies.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23208700/
Muscle protein synthesis by positron-emission tomography with L-[methyl-11C]methionine in adult humans,"A J Fischman, Y M Yu, E Livni, J W Babich, V R Young, N M Alpert, R G Tompkins","Existing methods for assessing protein synthetic rates (PSRs) in human skeletal muscle are invasive and do not readily provide information about individual muscle groups. Recent studies in canine skeletal muscle yielded PSRs similar to results of simultaneous stable isotope measurements using L-[1-13C, methyl-2H3]methionine, suggesting that positron-emission tomography (PET) with L-[methyl-11C]methionine could be used along with blood sampling and a kinetic model to provide a less invasive, regional assessment of PSR. We have extended and refined this method in an investigation with healthy volunteers studied in the postabsorptive state. They received approximately 25 mCi of L-[methyl-11C]methionine with serial PET imaging of the thighs and arterial blood sampling for a period of 90 min. Tissue and metabolite-corrected arterial blood time activity curves were fitted to a three-compartment model. PSR (nmol methionine.min-1.g muscle tissue-1) was calculated from the fitted parameter values and the plasma methionine concentrations, assuming equal rates of protein synthesis and degradation. Pooled mean PSR for the anterior and posterior sites was 0.50 +/- 0.040. When converted to a fractional synthesis rate for mixed proteins in muscle, assuming a protein-bound methionine content of muscle tissue, the value of 0.125 +/- 0.01%.h-1 compares well with estimates from direct tracer incorporation studies, which generally range from approximately 0.05 to 0.09%.h-1. We conclude that PET can be used to estimate skeletal muscle PSR in healthy human subjects and that it holds promise for future in vivo, noninvasive studies of the influences of physiological factors, pharmacological manipulations, and disease states on this important component of muscle protein turnover and balance.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9788993/
Comparative evaluation of the algorithms for parametric mapping of the novel myocardial PET imaging agent 18F-FPTP,"Ji Who Kim, Seongho Seo, Hyeon Sik Kim, Dong-Yeon Kim, Ho-Young Lee, Keon Wook Kang, Dong Soo Lee, Hee-Seung Bom, Jung-Joon Min, Jae Sung Lee","Objective: (18F-fluoropentyl)triphenylphosphonium salt (18F-FPTP) is a new promising myocardial PET imaging tracer. It shows high accumulation in cardiomyocytes and rapid clearance from liver. We performed compartmental analysis of18F-FPTP PET images in rat and evaluated two linear analyses: linear least-squares (LLS) and a basis function method (BFM) for generating parametric images. The minimum dynamic scan duration for kinetic analysis was also investigated and computer simulation undertaken.

Methods: 18F-FPTP dynamic PET (18 min) and CT images were acquired from rats with myocardial infarction (MI) (n = 12). Regions of interest (ROIs) were on the left ventricle, normal myocardium, and MI region. Two-compartment (K1and k2; 2C2P) and three-compartment (K1-k3; 3C3P) models with irreversible uptake were compared for goodness-of-fit. Partial volume and spillover correction terms (Vaand α = 1 - Va) were also incorporated. LLS and BFM were applied to ROI- and voxel-based kinetic parameter estimations. Results were compared with the standard ROI-based nonlinear least-squares (NLS) results of the corresponding compartment model. A simulation explored statistical properties of the estimation methods.

Results: The 2C2P model was most suitable for describing18F-FPTP kinetics. Average K1, k2, and Vavalues were, respectively, 6.8 (ml/min/g), 1.1 (min-1), and 0.44 in normal myocardium and 1.4 (ml/min/g), 1.1 (min-1), and 0.32, in MI tissue. Ten minutes of data was sufficient for the estimation. LLS and BFM estimations correlated well with NLS values for the ROI level (K1: y = 1.06x + 0.13, r2= 0.96 and y = 1.13x + 0.08, r2= 0.97) and voxel level (K1: y = 1.22x - 0.30, r2= 0.90 and y = 1.26x + 0.00, r2= 0.92). Regional distribution of kinetic parametric images (αK1, K1, k2, Va) was physiologically relevant. LLS and BFM showed more robust characteristics than NLS in the simulation.

Conclusions: Fast kinetics and highly specific uptake of18F-FPTP by myocardium enabled quantitative analysis with the 2C2P model using only the initial 10 min of data. LLS and BFM were feasible for estimating voxel-wise parameters. These two methods will be useful for quantitative evaluation of18F-FPTP distribution in myocardium and in further studies with different conditions, disease models, and species.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28444503/
"Radiopharmaceuticals for positron emission tomography. Development of new, innovative tracers for measuring the rates of physiologic and biochemical processes","S J Gatley, T R DeGrado, M L Kornguth, J E Holden","Positron emission tomography (PET) can give quantitative local information about many processes in the intact human body, which may be useful both for basic studies of metabolic processes in health and disease, and also for diagnostic purposes in individual patients. PET is absolutely limited by the availability of suitable radiotracers. Natural substrates for metabolic processes, e.g. 11C glucose, are not generally useful; compounds with a restricted range of metabolic transformations, all of which can be distinguished kinetically, are better. Radiotracer behavior may then be describable by a fairly simple set of linear first-order rate constants (kinetic model) which can each be determined from PET scan sequences and which can be combined to give physiologically meaningful data. Three 18F compounds, which form a hierarchy of pharmacologic complexity, are briefly described: fluoromethane, for blood flow, 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-D-glucose, for glucose metabolic rates, and 16-fluoropalmitic acid, a candidate tracer for rates of long-chain fatty acid metabolism.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1966972/
Precision measurements of brain oxygen utilization with positron emission tomography,"John J Lee, Joshua S Shimony, Nicholas Metcalf, Andrei G Vlassenko, Manu S Goyal","Oxygen utilization is important for studies of brain metabolism, alongside other measurements such as for glucose metabolism. Oxygen and other measurements with [15O] tracers and PET, however, are significantly more challenging than measurements of [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose, the standard for probing tissue glucose metabolism in vivo, in part due to the much shorter radioactive half-life of [15O]. This work examines details of precision measurement of [15O] tracers and their kinetics. Investigations of arterial input functions (AIFs) and image-derived input functions (IDIFs) have figured prominently for PET, but [15O] tracers are rarely studied given the small numbers of PET facilities equipped to work with these tracers, particularly in their inhaled form. Estimates of IDIFs and AIFs for [15O] tracers have demonstrably distinct characteristics arising from instrumentation as well as circulatory physiology. To reconcile IDIFs and AIFs, we developed a generalizable model for bolus tracer transport, corrected for known effects of instrumentation for measuring IDIFs and AIFs, and found intravascular[15O]CO to be especially suited for constructing a robust recovery coefficient for IDIFs compared against AIFs. Within a Bayesian framework for posterior estimation and estimating data evidence, IDIFs provide parameter estimates compatible with AIFs in the setting of biological variability. IDIFs also provide data evidence that exceeds that of results from AIFs. These suggest that scalar recovery coefficients may be adequate to estimate partial volume effects, and that the circulatory consistency of internal carotid IDIFs with brain tissue perfusion provides greater precision than what can be estimated using radial artery AIFs, which exhibit greater variability of recirculation wave forms.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40027694/
Comparison of two compartmental models for describing receptor ligand kinetics and receptor availability in multiple injection PET studies,"E D Morris, N M Alpert, A J Fischman","The goal of research with receptor ligands and PET is the characterization of an in vivo system that measures rates of association and dissociation of a ligand-receptor complex and the density of available binding sites. It has been suggested that multiple injection studies of radioactive ligand are more likely to identify model parameters than are single injection studies. Typically, at least one of the late injections is at a low specific activity (SA), so that part of the positron emission tomography (PET) curve reflects ligand dissociation. Low SA injections and the attendant reductions in receptor availability, however, may violate tracer kinetic assumptions, namely, tracer may no longer be in steady state with the total (labeled and unlabeled) ligand. Tissue response becomes critically dependent on the dose of total ligand, and an accurate description of the cold ligand in the tissue is needed to properly model the system. Two alternative models have been applied to the receptor modeling problem, which reduces to describing the time-varying number of available receptor sites. The first (Huang et al., 1989) contains only compartments for the hot ligand, 'hot only' (HO), but indirectly accounts for the action of cold ligand at receptor sites via SA. The second stipulates separate compartments for the hot and cold ligands, 'hot and cold' (HC), thus explicitly calculating available number of receptors. We examined these models and contrasted their abilities to predict PET activity, receptor availability, and SA in each tissue compartment. For multiple injection studies, the models consistently predicted different PET activities--especially following the third injection. Only for very high rate constants were the models identical for multiple injections. In one case, simulated PET curves were quite similar, but discrepancies appeared in predictions of receptor availability. The HO model predicted nonphysiological changes in the availability of receptor sites and introduced errors of 30-60% into estimates of B'max for test data. We, therefore, strongly recommend the use of the HC model for all analyses of multiple injection PET studies.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8784229/
Cluster analysis in kinetic modelling of the brain: a noninvasive alternative to arterial sampling,"Matthew Liptrot, Karen H Adams, Lars Martiny, Lars H Pinborg, Markus N Lonsdale, Niels V Olsen, Søren Holm, Claus Svarer, Gitte M Knudsen","In emission tomography, quantification of brain tracer uptake, metabolism or binding requires knowledge of the cerebral input function. Traditionally, this is achieved with arterial blood sampling. We propose a noninvasive alternative via the use of a blood vessel time-activity curve (TAC) extracted directly from dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) scans by cluster analysis. Five healthy subjects were injected with the 5HT(2A)-receptor ligand [(18)F]-altanserin and blood samples were subsequently taken from the radial artery and cubital vein. Eight regions-of-interest (ROI) TACs were extracted from the PET data set. Hierarchical K-means cluster analysis was performed on the PET time series to extract a cerebral vasculature ROI. The number of clusters was varied from K = 1 to 10 for the second of the two-stage method. Determination of the correct number of clusters was performed by the 'within-variance' measure and by 3D visual inspection of the homogeneity of the determined clusters. The cluster-determined input curve was then used in Logan plot analysis and compared with the arterial and venous blood samples, and additionally with one of the currently used alternatives to arterial blood sampling, the Simplified Reference Tissue Model (SRTM) and Logan analysis with cerebellar TAC as an input. There was a good agreement (P < 0.05) between the values of Distribution Volume (DV) obtained from the K-means-clustered input function and those from the arterial blood samples. This work acts as a proof-of-principle that the use of cluster analysis on a PET data set could obviate the requirement for arterial cannulation when determining the input function for kinetic modelling of ligand binding, and that this may be a superior approach as compared to the other noninvasive alternatives.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14980551/
An improved optimization algorithm of the three-compartment model with spillover and partial volume corrections for dynamic FDG PET images of small animal hearts in vivo,"Yinlin Li, Bijoy K Kundu","The three-compartment model with spillover (SP) and partial volume (PV) corrections has been widely used for noninvasive kinetic parameter studies of dynamic 2-[18F] fluoro-2deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography images of small animal hearts in vivo. However, the approach still suffers from estimation uncertainty or slow convergence caused by the commonly used optimization algorithms. The aim of this study was to develop an improved optimization algorithm with better estimation performance. Femoral artery blood samples, image-derived input functions from heart ventricles and myocardial time-activity curves (TACs) were derived from data on 16 C57BL/6 mice obtained from the UCLA Mouse Quantitation Program. Parametric equations of the average myocardium and the blood pool TACs with SP and PV corrections in a three-compartment tracer kinetic model were formulated. A hybrid method integrating artificial immune-system and interior-reflective Newton methods were developed to solve the equations. Two penalty functions and one late time-point tail vein blood sample were used to constrain the objective function. The estimation accuracy of the method was validated by comparing results with experimental values using the errors in the areas under curves (AUCs) of the model corrected input function (MCIF) and the 18F-FDG influx constant Ki. Moreover, the elapsed time was used to measure the convergence speed. The overall AUC error of MCIF for the 16 mice averaged -1.4 ± 8.2%, with correlation coefficients of 0.9706. Similar results can be seen in the overall Kierror percentage, which was 0.4 ± 5.8% with a correlation coefficient of 0.9912. The t-test P value for both showed no significant difference. The mean and standard deviation of the MCIF AUC and Kipercentage errors have lower values compared to the previously published methods. The computation time of the hybrid method is also several times lower than using just a stochastic algorithm. The proposed method significantly improved the model estimation performance in terms of the accuracy of the MCIF and Ki, as well as the convergence speed.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29480159/
PET quantification of specific binding of carbon-11-nicotine in human brain,"R F Muzic Jr, M S Berridge, R P Friedland, N Zhu, A D Nelson","Previous work on the PET measured uptake of (S)-[11C]nicotine presents conflicting findings as to whether it reflects specific binding.

Methods: We studied the uptake of (R)-[11C]nicotine and (S)-[11C]nicotine in normal volunteers at baseline conditions and after a challenge with unlabeled (S)-nicotine to decrease the concentration of free binding sites or with CO2 to increase perfusion. We analyzed the data using two- and three-compartment models.

Results: We found tissue pharmacokinetics of (R)- and (S)-[11C]nicotine are adequately described by the two-compartment model. (S)-nicotine challenge induced small but statistically significant reductions in distribution volume (DV) of both (R)- and (S)-[11C]nicotine. The changes in DV could not be attributed to perfusion changes because DV was not affected by CO2 challenge. Although the reduction in DV indicates sensitivity of [11C]nicotine to status of nicotinic binding sites, the small magnitude of the reduction suggests that most nicotine uptake is nonspecific.

Conclusion: Although differences in DV attributable to specific binding were detected, (R)- and (S)-[11C]nicotine are relatively poor tracers for studying nicotinic binding sites using PET.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9867140/
Optimization of a Model Corrected Blood Input Function from Dynamic FDG-PET Images of Small Animal Heart In Vivo,"Min Zhong, Bijoy K Kundu","Quantitative evaluation of dynamic Positron Emission Tomography (PET) of mouse heart in vivo is challenging due to the small size of the heart and limited intrinsic spatial resolution of the PET scanner. Here, we optimized a compartment model which can simultaneously correct for spill over and partial volume effects for both blood pool and the myocardium, compute kinetic rate parameters and generate model corrected blood input function (MCBIF) from ordered subset expectation maximization - maximum a posteriori (OSEM-MAP) cardiac and respiratory gated18F-FDG PET images of mouse heart with attenuation correction in vivo, without any invasive blood sampling. Arterial blood samples were collected from a single mouse to indicate the feasibility of the proposed method. In order to establish statistical significance, venous blood samples from n=6 mice were obtained at 2 late time points, when SP contamination from the tissue to the blood is maximum. We observed that correct bounds and initial guesses for the PV and SP coefficients accurately model the wash-in and wash-out dynamics of the tracer from mouse blood. The residual plot indicated an average difference of about 1.7% between the blood samples and MCBIF. The downstream rate of myocardial FDG influx constant, Ki (0.15±0.03 min-1), compared well with Ki obtained from arterial blood samples (P=0.716). In conclusion, the proposed methodology is not only quantitative but also reproducible.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24741130/
A fast nonlinear method for parametric imaging of myocardial perfusion by dynamic (13)N-ammonia PET,"S R Golish, J D Hove, H R Schelbert, S S Gambhir","A parametric image of myocardial perfusion (mL/min/g) is a quantitative image generated by fitting a tracer kinetic model to dynamic (13)N-ammonia PET data on a pixel-by-pixel basis. There are several methods for such parameter estimation problems, including weighted nonlinear regression (WNLR) and a fast linearizing method known as Patlak analysis. Previous work showed that sigmoidal networks can be used for parameter estimation of mono- and biexponential models. The method used in this study is a hybrid of WNLR and sigmoidal networks called nonlinear regression estimation (NRE). The purpose of the study is to compare NRE with WNLR and Patlak analysis for parametric imaging of perfusion in the canine heart by (13)N-ammonia PET.

Methods: A simulation study measured the statistical performance of NRE, WNLR, and Patlak analysis for a probabilistic model of time-activity curves. Four canine subjects were injected with 740 MBq (13)N-ammonia and scanned dynamically. Images were reconstructed with filtered backprojection and resliced into short-axis cuts. Parametric images of a single midventricular plane per subject were generated by NRE, WNLR, and Patlak analysis. Small regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn on each parametric image (8 ROIs per subject for a total of 32).

Results: For the simulation study, the median absolute value of the relative error for a perfusion value of 1.0 mL/min/g was 16.6% for NRE, 17.9% for WNLR, 19.5% for Patlak analysis, and 14.5% for an optimal WNLR method (computable by simulation only). All methods are unbiased conditioned on a wide range of perfusion values. For the canine studies, the least squares line fits comparing NRE (y) and Patlak analysis (z) with WNLR (x) for all 32 ROIs were y = 1.02x - 0.028 and z = 0.90x + 0.019, respectively. Both NRE and Patlak analysis generate 128 x 128 parametric images in seconds.

Conclusion: The statistical performance of NRE is competitive with WNLR and superior to Patlak analysis for parametric imaging of myocardial perfusion. NRE is a fast nonlinear alternative to Patlak analysis and other fast linearizing methods for parametric imaging. NRE should be applicable to many other tracers and tracer kinetic models.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11390558/
Multicompartmental analysis of [11C]-carfentanil binding to opiate receptors in humans measured by positron emission tomography,"J J Frost, K H Douglass, H S Mayberg, R F Dannals, J M Links, A A Wilson, H T Ravert, W C Crozier, H N Wagner Jr","[11C]-Carfentanil is a high affinity opiate agonist that can be used to localize mu opiate receptors in humans by positron emission tomography (PET). A four-compartment model was used to obtain quantitative estimates of rate constants for receptor association and dissociation. PET studies were performed in five normal subjects in the absence and presence of 1 mg/kg naloxone. Arterial plasma concentration of [11C]-carfentanil and its labeled metabolites were determined during each PET study. The value of k3/k4 = Bmax/kD was determined for each subject in the presence and absence of naloxone. There was a significant reduction in the value of k3/k4 from 3.4 +/- 0.92 to 0.26 +/- 0.13 in the thalamus (p less than 0.01) and from 1.8 +/- 0.33 to 0.16 +/- 0.065 in the frontal cortex (p less than 0.001). Mean values of frontal cortex/occipital cortex and thalamus/occipital cortex ratios were determined for the interval 35-70 min after injection when receptor binding is high relative to nonspecific binding. The relationship between the measured region/occipital cortex values and the corresponding values of k3/k4 in the presence and absence of naloxone was: regions/occipital cortex = 0.95 + 0.74 (k3/k4) with r = 0.98 (n = 20). Simulation studies also demonstrated a linear relationship between the thalamus/occipital cortex or frontal cortex/occipital cortex ratio and k3/k4 for less than twofold increases or decreases in k3/k4. Simulation studies in which thalamic blood flow was varied demonstrated no significant effect on the region/occipital cortex ratio at 35-70 min for a twofold increase or fourfold decrease in blood flow. Therefore, the region/occipital cortex ratio can be used to quantitate changes in k3/k4 when tracer kinetic modeling is not feasible.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2541148/
A hybrid deconvolution approach for estimation of in vivo non-displaceable binding for brain PET targets without a reference region,"Francesca Zanderigo, J John Mann, R Todd Ogden","Background and aim: Estimation of a PET tracer's non-displaceable distribution volume (VND) is required for quantification of specific binding to its target of interest. VND is generally assumed to be comparable brain-wide and is determined either from a reference region devoid of the target, often not available for many tracers and targets, or by imaging each subject before and after blocking the target with another molecule that has high affinity for the target, which is cumbersome and involves additional radiation exposure. Here we propose, and validate for the tracers [11C]DASB and [11C]CUMI-101, a new data-driven hybrid deconvolution approach (HYDECA) that determines VND at the individual level without requiring either a reference region or a blocking study.

Methods: HYDECA requires the tracer metabolite-corrected concentration curve in blood plasma and uses a singular value decomposition to estimate the impulse response function across several brain regions from measured time activity curves. HYDECA decomposes each region's impulse response function into the sum of a parametric non-displaceable component, which is a function of VND, assumed common across regions, and a nonparametric specific component. These two components differentially contribute to each impulse response function. Different regions show different contributions of the two components, and HYDECA examines data across regions to find a suitable common VND. HYDECA implementation requires determination of two tuning parameters, and we propose two strategies for objectively selecting these parameters for a given tracer: using data from blocking studies, and realistic simulations of the tracer. Using available test-retest data, we compare HYDECA estimates of VND and binding potentials to those obtained based on VND estimated using a purported reference region.

Results: For [11C]DASB and [11C]CUMI-101, we find that regardless of the strategy used to optimize the tuning parameters, HYDECA provides considerably less biased estimates of VND than those obtained, as is commonly done, using a non-ideal reference region. HYDECA test-retest reproducibility is comparable to that obtained using a VND determined from a non-ideal reference region, when considering the binding potentials BPP and BPND.

Conclusions: HYDECA can provide subject-specific estimates of VND without requiring a blocking study for tracers and targets for which a valid reference region does not exist.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28459878/
P-glycoprotein function at the blood-brain barrier in humans can be quantified with the substrate radiotracer 11C-N-desmethyl-loperamide,"William C Kreisl, Jeih-San Liow, Nobuyo Kimura, Nicholas Seneca, Sami S Zoghbi, Cheryl L Morse, Peter Herscovitch, Victor W Pike, Robert B Innis","Permeability-glycoprotein (P-gp), an efflux transporter in several organs, acts at the blood-brain barrier to protect the brain from exogenous toxins. P-gp almost completely blocks brain entry of the PET radiotracer (11)C-N-desmethyl-loperamide ((11)C-dLop). We examined the ability of (11)C-dLop to quantify P-gp function in humans after increasing doses of tariquidar, an inhibitor of P-gp.

Methods: Seventeen healthy volunteers had a total of 23 PET scans with (11)C-dLop at baseline and after increasing doses of tariquidar (2, 4, and 6 mg/kg intravenously). A subset of subjects received PET with (15)O-H(2)O to measure cerebral blood flow. Brain uptake of (11)C-dLop was quantified in 2 ways. Without blood data, uptake was measured as area under the time-activity curve in the brain from 10 to 30 min (AUC(10-30)). With arterial blood data, brain uptake was quantified with compartmental modeling to estimate the rates of entry into (K(1)) and efflux from (k(2)) the brain.

Results: Brain uptake of radioactivity was negligible at baseline and increased only slightly (approximately 30%) after 2 mg of tariquidar per kilogram. In contrast, 4 and 6 mg of tariquidar per kilogram increased brain uptake 2- and 4-fold, respectively. Greater brain uptake reflected greater brain entry (K(1)), because efflux (k(2)) and cerebral blood flow did not differ between tariquidar-treated and untreated subjects. In the subjects who received the highest dose of tariquidar (and had the highest brain uptake), regional values of K(1) correlated linearly with absolute cerebral blood flow, consistent with high single-pass extraction of (11)C-dLop. AUC(10-30) correlated linearly with K(1).

Conclusion: P-gp function at the blood-brain barrier in humans can be quantified using PET and (11)C-dLop. A simple measure of brain uptake (AUC(10-30)) may be used as a surrogate of the fully quantified rate constant for brain entry (K(1)) and thereby avoid arterial sampling. However, to dissect the function of P-gp itself, both brain uptake and the influx rate constant must be corrected for radiotracer delivery (blood flow).",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20237038/
Synthesis and evaluation in rats of the dopamine D2/3 receptor agonist 18F-AMC20 as a potential radioligand for PET,"Vladimir Shalgunov, Jan-Peter van Wieringen, Henk M Janssen, P Michel Fransen, Rudi A J O Dierckx, Martin C Michel, Jan Booij, Philip H Elsinga","Dopamine D(2/3) receptor (D(2/3)R) agonist PET tracers are better suited for the imaging of synaptic dopaminergic neurotransmission than D(2/3)R antagonists and may also offer the opportunity to study in vivo the high-affinity state of D(2/3)R (D(2/3)RHigh). With the aim to develop (18)F-labeled D2/3R agonists suitable for widespread clinical application, we report here on the synthesis and in vitro and in vivo evaluation of a D(2/3)R agonist ligand from the aminomethyl chromane (AMC) class-(R)-2-[(4-(18)F-fluorobenzylamino)methyl]chroman-7-ol ((18)F- AMC20: ).

Methods: In vitro affinities of AMC20: toward dopaminergic receptor subtypes were measured in membrane homogenates prepared from HEK293 cells expressing human dopamine receptors. Agonism of AMC20: was assessed in the arrestin recruitment assay in Chinese hamster ovary-K(1) cells expressing the long isoform of D(2)R (D(2)RLong). D(2/3)R-specific binding of (18)F- AMC20: was evaluated in brain slices of Sprague-Dawley rats by in vitro autoradiography and in living rats by in vivo small-animal PET imaging and ex vivo autoradiography. PET data were analyzed with 1- and 2-tissue compartmental models, the simplified reference tissue model, and Logan graphical analysis. Specificity of binding was tested by blocking D(2/3)R with raclopride (coincubation with 10 μM in vitro, administration of 1.0 mg/kg in vivo).

Results: In membrane homogenates, AMC20: demonstrated picomolar affinity at D(2)RHigh (mean inhibition constant [K(i)] = 85 pM) and excellent selectivity against the low-affinity state of D(2)R (D(2)RLow) (mean K(i) = 84 nM, 988-fold selectivity) and D(1)-like receptors (mean K(i) = 5,062 nM at D1R). The efficacy of AMC20: was 90% of that of dopamine in the arrestin recruitment assay. Up to 70% of total binding of (18)F- AMC20: in the D2/3R-rich striatum in rat brain slices was D(2/3)R-specific; in living rats, the uptake ratio between the striatum and the D(2/3)R-poor cerebellum reached 2.0-2.5, depending on the measurement method. Radiometabolites of (18)F- AMC20: did not enter the brain. Striatal binding potential of (18)F- AMC20: varied between 0.49 and 0.59 depending on the estimation method. Pretreatment with 1 mg of raclopride per kilogram reduced the apparent specific binding of (18)F- AMC20: in the striatum.

Conclusion: (18)F- AMC20: shows specific binding to D(2/3)R in the striatum of living rats. Further optimization of the chemical structure of (18)F- AMC20: can lead to (18)F-labeled D(2/3) agonist PET tracers more suitable for in vivo clinical application.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25476538/
First (18)F-labeled tracer suitable for routine clinical imaging of sst receptor-expressing tumors using positron emission tomography,"Margret Schottelius, Thorsten Poethko, Michael Herz, Jean-Claude Reubi, Horst Kessler, Markus Schwaiger, Hans-Jürgen Wester","Purpose: Despite excellent radionuclide characteristics, no (18)F-labeled peptides are available for quantitative peptide receptor mapping using positron emission tomography (PET) so far, mainly due to time-consuming multistep radiosyntheses with limited overall yields. A newly developed two-step chemoselective conjugation method allows rapid and high-yield [(18)F]fluorination of peptides via oxime formation and was applied for the synthesis of new (18)F-labeled carbohydrated Tyr(3)-octreotate (TOCA) analogs with optimized pharmacokinetics suitable for clinical routine somatostatin-receptor (sst) imaging.

Experimental design: (18)F-labeled glucose (Gluc-S-) and cellobiose (Cel-S-) derivatives of aminooxy-functionalized TOCA were synthesized via oxime formation with 4-[(18)F]fluorobenzaldehyde ([(18)F]FBOA-peptides). Both the in vitro internalization profile of Gluc-S-Dpr([(18)F]FBOA)TOCA and Cel-S-Dpr([(18)F]FBOA)TOCA in hsst(2)-expressing Chinese hamster ovary cells (dual tracer protocol) and their biodistribution in AR42J tumor-bearing mice were investigated and compared with two [(18)F]fluoropropionylated ([(18)F]FP) analogs, Gluc-Lys([(18)F]FP)TOCA and Gluc-S-Dpr([(18)F]FP)TOCA.

Results: In contrast to [(18)F]FP-labeling (3 h), chemo-selective [(18)F]FBOA-formation (50 min) afforded the respective radiopeptides in high yields (65-85%). In vitro, Gluc-S-Dpr([(18)F]FBOA)TOCA and Cel-S-Dpr([(18)F]FBOA)-TOCA showed high internalization (139 +/- 2 and 163 +/- 8 of the reference [(125)I]Tyr(3)-octreotide, respectively), which was reflected by high tumor accumulation in vivo [21.8 +/- 1.4 and 24.0 +/- 2.5% of injected dose/g (1 h), respectively]. How-ever, only Cel-S-Dpr([(18)F]FBOA)TOCA and Gluc-S-Dpr([(18)F]FP)TOCA (tumor: 15.1 +/- 1.5% of injected dose/g) with its very low accumulation in all of the nontarget organs showed improved tumor:organ ratios compared with Gluc-Lys([(18)F]FP)TOCA. For Cel-S-Dpr([(18)F]FBOA)TOCA,tumor:organ ratios (1 h) were 42:1, 27:1, 15:1, 3:1, and 208:1 for blood, liver, intestine, kidney, and muscle, respectively.

Conclusion: Due to the fast and high-yield chemoselective radiofluorination strategy and to its excellent pharmacokinetics, Cel-S-Dpr([(18)F]FBOA)TOCA represents the first tracer suitable for routine clinical application in PET somatostatin receptor imaging.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15173065/
Preclinical Evaluation and Quantification of 18F-Fluoroethyl and 18F-Fluoropropyl Analogs of SCH442416 as Radioligands for PET Imaging of the Adenosine A2A Receptor in Rat Brain,"Shivashankar Khanapur, Aren van Waarde, Rudi A J O Dierckx, Philip H Elsinga, Michel J B Koole","The cerebral adenosine A2Areceptor is an attractive therapeutic target for neuropsychiatric disorders.18F-fluoroethyl and18F-fluoropropyl analogs of18F-labeled pyrazolo[4,3-e]-1,2,4-triazolo[1,5-c]pyrimidine (SCH442416) (18F-FESCH and18F-FPSCH, respectively) were developed as A2Areceptor-specific PET ligands. Our aim was to determine an appropriate compartmental model for tracer kinetics, evaluate a reference tissue approach, and select the most suitable PET ligand.Methods:A 90-min dynamic PET scan with arterial blood sampling and metabolite analysis was acquired for 22 healthy male Wistar rats starting at the time of18F-FESCH (n= 12) and18F-FPSCH (n= 10) injection. For each tracer, half the animals were vehicle-treated whereas the other half were pretreated with the A2Areceptor-selective antagonist KW-6002, inducing full blocking. Regional tissue total volume of distribution (VT) was estimated by 1- and 2-tissue-compartment modeling (1TCM and 2TCM, respectively) and Logan graphical analysis. Midbrain, cerebellum, and hippocampus were evaluated as the reference region by comparing baseline VTwith VTunder full blocking conditions and comparing striatal nondisplaceable binding potential (BPND) using a simplified reference tissue model (SRTM) with distribution volume ratio minus 1 (DVR - 1) for 60- and 90-min scans.Results:On the basis of the Akaike information criterion, 1TCM and 2TCM were the most appropriate models for18F-FPSCH (baseline striatal VT, 3.7 ± 1.1) and18F-FESCH (baseline striatal VT, 5.0 ± 2.0), respectively. Baseline striatal VTdid not significantly differ between tracers. After pretreatment, striatal VTwas reduced significantly, with no significant decrease in hippocampus, midbrain, or cerebellum VTBaseline striatal SRTM BPNDdid not differ significantly from DVR - 1 except for18F-FPSCH when using a 60-min scan and midbrain as the reference region, whereas Bland-Altman analysis found a smaller bias for18F-FESCH and a 60-min scan. After pretreatment, striatal SRTM BPNDdid not significantly differ from zero except for18F-FPSCH when using hippocampus as the reference region. Striatal SRTM BPNDusing midbrain or cerebellum as the reference region was significantly lower for18F-FPSCH (range, 1.41-2.62) than for18F-FESCH (range, 1.64-3.36).Conclusion:Dynamic PET imaging under baseline and blocking conditions determined18F-FESCH to be the most suitable PET ligand for quantifying A2Areceptor expression in the rat brain. Accurate quantification is achieved by a 60-min dynamic PET scan and the use of either cerebellum or midbrain as the reference region.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27789720/
Shortened PET data acquisition protocol for the quantification of 18F-FDG kinetics,"Ludwig G Strauss, Antonia Dimitrakopoulou-Strauss, Uwe Haberkorn","A modified short dynamic protocol was defined and evaluated to predict kinetic parameters of (18)F-FDG metabolism from a dynamic data acquisition.

Methods: The evaluation included 151 datasets obtained from 60 patients examined with (18)F-FDG and a dynamic data acquisition protocol of 60 min. Standardized uptake values (SUVs) were calculated for the individual time frames, and a 2-compartment model was applied to the data. The kinetic parameters and the (18)F-FDG influx, calculated from the model data, served as the reference for the analysis. Correlation was analyzed for the SUVs and the reference data. Subset analysis identified time intervals that can be used to predict the reference parameters based on a second-order polynomial function.

Results: Significant correlations were noted for SUVs and (18)F-FDG influx, vascular fraction (VB), and the rate constant k1. The influx was associated mainly with SUVs of late acquisition times, whereas higher correlations were noted for early acquisition intervals and VB, as well as k1. A short dynamic acquisition protocol was defined on the basis of a short dynamic sequence 1-10 min after tracer injection and a static acquisition 56-60 min after tracer application. The correlation coefficients exceeded 0.9 for influx, VB, and k1 when the SUVs of the input area (blood) and the target area were used to predict the kinetic parameters.

Conclusion: A short dynamic data acquisition protocol can be used to obtain more detailed information about (18)F-FDG kinetics. The results demonstrate that (18)F-FDG influx, VB, and k1 can be estimated with high accuracy from SUVs.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14660719/

Plasma analysis of FMT and its F18-labeled metabolites 6-fluoro-3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (FPAC) and 6-fluoro-3-hydroxyphenylethylamine (FMA) during PET scanning enabled kinetic analysis of FMT uptake. A separate study examined brain FMT metabolism in MPTP-naive monkeys euthanized 60 or 120 min after FMT injection. Almost 60% of total plasma F-18 activity was associated with FPAC and FMA 120 min after FMT injection. The FMT signal accumulated preferentially in dopaminergic areas such as caudate and putamen. This bilateral FMT signal was disrupted after unilateral intracarotid artery (ICA) MPTP infusion which reduced ipsilateral striatal activity. A three compartment three kinetic rate constant model for FMT uptake revealed reduced FMT decarboxylation (k3) in ipsilateral caudate and putamen after unilateral MPTP although a further decrease was not evident after intravenous MPTP. FPAC was the major F-18 species in all brain regions except in cerebellum where FMT was predominant 60 min post-mortem. FPAC was most concentrated in dopaminergic areas whereas lower levels occurred in areas containing few dopamine terminals. These data demonstrate preferential FMT metabolism and F-18 retention in dopaminergic tissue and support the use of FMT to evaluate normal and abnormal dopaminergic function.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9098552/
Effect of carbon-11-acetate recirculation on estimates of myocardial oxygen consumption by PET,"A Buck, H G Wolpers, G D Hutchins, V Savas, T J Mangner, N Nguyen, M Schwaiger","Mono- and biexponential fitting of myocardial 11C-acetate kinetics does not account for the effect of recirculating 11C activity following intravenous injection of the tracer. A tracer kinetic model comprising two and three compartments was developed to describe intravascular and myocardial 11C-acetate kinetics defined by PET. This model approach including a correction for 11C-metabolites in blood was validated by correlating the model parameter estimates with directly measured oxygen consumption (MVO2) in 11 closed-chest dog experiments over a wide range of cardiac work. The model parameter k2 closely correlated with oxygen consumption (r = 0.94). This approach was subsequently applied to human studies and k2-related to rate-pressure product (PRP). In comparison to conventional monoexponential fitting of 11C-acetate tissue kinetics, the model approach improved the correlation coefficients of scintigraphic MVO2 estimates and PRP values from 0.61 to 0.91. Thus, analysis of myocardial 11C-acetate and clearance kinetics with a tracer kinetic model corrects for recirculating 11C-activity and may provide more consistent estimates of myocardial oxygen consumption.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1919738/
Evaluation of serotonergic transporters using PET and [11C](+)McN-5652: assessment of methods,"A Buck, P M Gucker, R D Schönbächler, M Arigoni, S Kneifel, F X Vollenweider, S M Ametamey, C Burger","[11C](+)McN-5652 is an established positron emission tomography tracer used to assess serotonergic transporter density. Several methods have been used to analyze [11C](+)McN-5652 data; however, no evaluation of candidate methods has been published in detail yet. In this study, compartmental modeling using a one-tissue compartment model (K1, k2""), a two-tissue compartment model (K1 to k4), and a noncompartmental method that relies on a reference region devoid of specific binding sites were assessed. Because of its low density of serotonergic transporters, white matter was chosen as reference. Parameters related to transporter density were the total distribution volume DV"" (= K1/k2"", one tissue compartment), DVtot, (=K1/k1' (1 + k3/k4), two tissue compartments), and Rv (= k3'/k4, noncompartmental method). The DV"", DVtot, and Rv values extended over a similar range and reflected the known pattern of serotonergic transporters. However, all parameters related to transporter density were markedly confounded by nonspecific binding. With regard to K1, the one-tissue compartment model yielded markedly lower values, which were, however, more stable. The minimal study duration needed to determine stable values for the distribution volume was approximately 60 minutes. The choice of the method to analyze [11C](+)McN-5652 data depends on the situation. Parametric maps of Rv are useful if no information on K1 is needed. If compartmental modeling is chosen, both the one- and the two-tissue compartment models have advantages. The one-tissue compartment model underestimates K1 but yields more robust values. The distribution volumes calculated with both models contain a similar amount of information. None of the parameters reflected serotonergic transporter density in a true quantitative manner, as all were confounded by nonspecific binding.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10698061/
Evaluation of cardiac beta-adrenoreceptors in the isolated perfused rat heart using (S)-11C-CGP12388,"Mitsuru Momose, Sybille Reder, David M Raffel, Petra Watzlowik, Hans-Jürgen Wester, Ngoc Nguyen, Philip H Elsinga, Frank M Bengel, Joerg Remien, Markus Schwaiger","(S)-(11)C-CGP12388 ((11)C-CGP12388) was recently developed as an in vivo PET tracer for the evaluation of cardiac beta-adrenergic receptors. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the myocardial kinetics of (11)C-CGP12388 using the perfused rat heart model.

Methods: Normal rat hearts were cannulated for retrograde perfusion according to the Langendorff method. Studies were performed using constant coronary flow rates of 12 mL/min (high flow: n = 6) and 6 mL/min (low flow: n = 6). Beta-adrenergic-blocking studies were also done using propranolol (blocking: n = 6). Two bolus injections of (11)C-CGP12388 were administered at a 25-min interval, and time-activity curves were measured using bismuth germanate detectors. The beta-adrenergic receptor density (B(max)) and total distribution volume (DV(tot)) were estimated using compartmental modeling. After the experiment, B(max) in vitro was measured for all hearts using (3)H-CGP12177, and the values were compared with the B(max) estimated in isolated hearts.

Results: DV(tot) was significantly lower in the blocking group than in the high-flow group (P < 0.01), and there was no significant difference in DV(tot) between the high- and the low-flow groups. B(max) values estimated from (11)C-CGP12388 kinetics were 5.05 +/- 0.90 pmol/g under the high-flow model and 5.20 +/- 0.63 pmol/g under the low-flow model. The B(max) results in isolated hearts correlated significantly with the measured in vitro B(max) values (r(2) = 0.69; P < 0.001).

Conclusion: Beta-adrenoreceptor density in the isolated rat heart can be quantified using (11)C-CGP12388 and a 2-injection protocol. The binding of the tracer was flow independent, with low nonspecific binding. These results suggest that (11)C-CGP12388 is a promising PET tracer that may be applicable to human studies.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15001690/
Catalytic activities of a cocaine hydrolase engineered from human butyrylcholinesterase against (+)- and (-)-cocaine,"Liu Xue, Shurong Hou, Wenchao Yang, Lei Fang, Fang Zheng, Chang-Guo Zhan","It can be argued that an ideal anti-cocaine medication would be one that accelerates cocaine metabolism producing biologically inactive metabolites via a route similar to the primary cocaine-metabolizing pathway, i.e., hydrolysis catalyzed by butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) in plasma. However, wild-type BChE has a low catalytic efficiency against naturally occurring (-)-cocaine. Interestingly, wild-type BChE has a much higher catalytic activity against unnatural (+)-cocaine. According to available positron emission tomography (PET) imaging analysis using [(11)C](-)-cocaine and [(11)C](+)-cocaine tracers in human subjects, only [(11)C](-)-cocaine was observed in the brain, whereas no significant [(11)C](+)-cocaine signal was observed in the brain. The available PET data imply that an effective therapeutic enzyme for treatment of cocaine abuse could be an exogenous cocaine-metabolizing enzyme with a catalytic activity against (-)-cocaine comparable to that of wild-type BChE against (+)-cocaine. Our recently designed A199S/F227A/S287G/A328 W/Y332G mutant of human BChE has a considerably improved catalytic efficiency against (-)-cocaine and has been proven active in vivo. In the present study, we have characterized the catalytic activities of wild-type BChE and the A199S/F227A/S287G/A328 W/Y332G mutant against both (+)- and (-)-cocaine at the same time under the same experimental conditions. Based on the obtained kinetic data, the A199S/F227A/S287G/A328 W/Y332G mutant has a similarly high catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM) against (+)- and (-)-cocaine, and indeed has a catalytic efficiency (k(cat/)K(M) = 1.84 × 10(9) M(-1) min(-1)) against (-)-cocaine comparable to that (k(cat)/K(M) = 1.37 × 10(9) M(-1) min(-1)) of wild-type BChE against (+)-cocaine. Thus, the mutant may be used to effectively prevent (-)-cocaine from entering brain and producing physiological effects in the enzyme-based treatment of cocaine abuse.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22917637/
Detection of Active Caspase-3 in Mouse Models of Stroke and Alzheimer's Disease with a Novel Dual Positron Emission Tomography/Fluorescent Tracer [68Ga]Ga-TC3-OGDOTA,"Valeriy G Ostapchenko, Jonatan Snir, Mojmir Suchy, Jue Fan, M Rebecca Cobb, Blaine A Chronik, Michael Kovacs, Vania F Prado, Robert H E Hudson, Stephen H Pasternak, Marco A M Prado, Robert Bartha","Apoptosis is a feature of stroke and Alzheimer's disease (AD), yet there is no accepted method to detect or follow apoptosis in the brain in vivo. We developed a bifunctional tracer [68Ga]Ga-TC3-OGDOTA containing a cell-penetrating peptide separated from fluorescent Oregon Green and68Ga-bound labels by the caspase-3 recognition peptide DEVD. We hypothesized that this design would allow [68Ga]Ga-TC3-OGDOTA to accumulate in apoptotic cells. In vitro, Ga-TC3-OGDOTA labeled apoptotic neurons following exposure to camptothecin, oxygen-glucose deprivation, andβ-amyloid oligomers. In vivo, PET showed accumulation of [68Ga]Ga-TC3-OGDOTA in the brain of mouse models of stroke or AD. Optical clearing revealed colocalization of [68Ga]Ga-TC3-OGDOTA and cleaved caspase-3 in brain cells. In stroke, [68Ga]Ga-TC3-OGDOTA accumulated in neurons in the penumbra area, whereas in AD mice [68Ga]Ga-TC3-OGDOTA was found in single cells in the forebrain and diffusely around amyloid plaques. In summary, this bifunctional tracer is selectively associated with apoptotic cells in vitro and in vivo in brain disease models and represents a novel tool for apoptosis detection that can be used in neurodegenerative diseases.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30755766/
On the accuracy of an [18F]FDOPA compartmental model: evidence for vesicular storage of [18F]fluorodopamine in vivo,"P Deep, A Gjedde, P Cumming","The biological accuracy of a nonlinear compartmental model describing the in vivo kinetics of L-3,4-dihydroxy-6-[18F]fluorophenylalanine ([18F]FDOPA) metabolism was investigated. Tissue activities for [18F]FDOPA and its labeled metabolites 3-O-methyl-[18F]FDOPA ([18F]OMFD), 6-[18F]fluorodopamine ([18F]FDA), L-3,4-dihydroxy-6-[18F]fluorophenylacetic acid ([18F]FDOPAC), and 6-[18F]fluorohomovanillic acid ([18F]FHVA) were calculated using a plasma [18F]FDOPA input function, and kinetic constants estimated previously by chromatographic fractionation of 18F-labeled compounds in plasma and brain extracts from rat. Present data accurately reflected the measured radiochemical composition in rat brain for tracer circulation times past 10 min. We formulated the hypothesis that the discrepancy between calculated and measured fractions of [18F]FDOPA and the deaminated metabolite [18F]FDOPAC at times earlier than 10 min reflected storage of [18F]FDA in vesicles without monoamine oxidase. This hypothesis explained the initially rapid appearance of [18F]FDOPAC in striatum by delayed transfer of [18F]FDA from cytosol into vesicles. We conclude that the simpler model of [18F]FDOPA compartmentation is accurate when the cytosolic and vesicular fractions of [18F]FDA are at steady-state; the approach to equilibrium has a time constant of 15-30 min. The present model is valid for positron emission tomography studies of [18F]FDOPA metabolism in living brain.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9350967/
Dissociation between global markers of bone formation and direct measurement of spinal bone formation in osteoporosis,"Michelle L Frost, Ignac Fogelman, Glen M Blake, Paul K Marsden, Gary Cook Jr","Regional bone metabolism measured using 18F-fluoride PET was assessed in 72 postmenopausal women classified as normal, osteopenic, or osteoporotic. Lower values of regional bone formation activity at the lumbar spine were seen in osteoporotic women, whereas global markers of bone formation were significantly increased.

Introduction: Evaluations of global bone remodeling have revealed that increased bone turnover is a feature of patients with osteoporosis. The noninvasive functional imaging technique of 18F-fluoride positron emission tomography (PET) allows the direct quantitative assessment of bone metabolism at specific sites in the skeleton, including the clinically important site of the lumbar spine.

Materials and methods: The aim of this study was to compare regional skeletal kinetics in 72 postmenopausal women (mean age, 61 years) classified as normal, osteopenic, or osteoporotic according to their BMD T score at the lumbar spine. Each woman had a dynamic PET scan of the lumbar spine after injection of 90 MBq 18F-fluoride ion and measurements of biochemical markers of bone formation and resorption. The arterial plasma input function was derived using aorta arterial activity from the PET image. Time-activity curves were obtained by placing regions of interest over the lumbar vertebrae. A three-compartmental model was used to calculate bone blood flow (K1) and the net plasma clearance of tracer to bone mineral (Ki), reflecting regional osteoblastic activity (ml/minutes/ml). Rate constants k2, k3, and k4, which describe transport between plasma, the extracellular fluid (ECF) compartment, and the bone mineral compartment, were also measured.

Results: The net uptake of fluoride to the bone mineral compartment (Ki) was significantly lower in the osteoporotic group compared with both the osteopenic and normal groups, with a mean difference of 0.005 ml/minutes/ml (16.7%). The fraction of the tracer in the extravascular tissue space that underwent specific binding to bone mineral (k3/k2 + k3) was also significantly reduced in the women classified as osteoporotic. In contrast, levels of bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSALP) were significantly higher in the osteoporotic group compared with the normal and osteopenic groups by 35% and 27%, respectively. A significant negative correlation (r = -0.41) was observed between levels of BSALP and the fraction of the tracer that underwent specific binding to bone mineral.

Conclusion: Lower values of Ki, a measurement of regional bone formation activity, were seen in women classified as osteoporotic, whereas levels of BSALP, a measure of global bone formation, were significantly increased. These findings are suggestive of increased global skeletal bone turnover in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis but with relatively reduced regional bone formation at the predominantly trabecular site of the lumbar spine.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15476579/
Comparison of methods to quantitate 18F-FDG uptake with PET during experimental acute lung injury,"Delphine L Chen, Mark A Mintun, Daniel P Schuster","PET with 18F-FDG may be useful for quantifying neutrophilic activation. We previously demonstrated that pulmonary neutrophil sequestration could be detected during acute lung injury (ALI), even without migration into the alveolar compartment. Using the influx constant Ki as the method to quantify lung 18F-FDG uptake, we also showed that Ki correlated positively with in vitro assays of 3H-deoxyglucose (3H-DG) uptake in cells harvested via bronchoalveolar lavage. In the present study, we have reanalyzed data from that study to determine if simpler nonkinetic methods of quantifying the pulmonary uptake of 18F-FDG could be as powerful as calculating Ki.

Methods: 18F-FDG uptake was quantified as Ki, calculated by 3-compartmental model analysis (used as the gold standard) and Patlak graphical analysis, with and without normalization for initial volume of tracer distribution; the standardized uptake value; and the tissue-to-plasma activity ratio (TPR).

Results: Values for Ki, determined either from a 3-compartmental model analysis of the time-activity data or by Patlak graphical analysis, were highly correlated (R2 = 0.97). The correlation was worse if these variables were normalized for the initial volume of tracer distribution. TPR was highly correlated with Ki determined by the compartmental model (R2 = 0.96) and with in vitro measurements of 3H-DG uptake (R2 = 0.63).

Conclusion: The TPR is a simple and equally effective alternative to dynamic imaging in determining net 18F-FDG uptake during ALI. Normalization of the kinetic data for differences in the initial volume of tracer distribution does not contribute significantly to signal interpretation during ALI.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15347728/
Measurement of transferrin receptor kinetics in the baboon liver using dynamic positron emission tomography imaging and [18F]holo-transferrin,"L Aloj, R E Carson, L Lang, P Herscovitch, W C Eckelman","We have evaluated the use of [18F]holo-transferrin ([18F]Tf) and positron emission tomography (PET) to measure in vivo Tf receptor expression and recycling using the baboon liver as a model. [18F]Tf was intravenously injected in three baboons and dynamic PET was performed over the region containing liver and spleen. In two of the three baboons, [18F]albumin ([18F]Alb), labeled with the same technique, was administered 3 hours later. Time activity curves (TACs) were obtained from liver and spleen for both tracers. TACs for [18F]Tf over the liver were fit to a pharmacokinetic model including vascular radioactivity and an extravascular tissue compartment corresponding to transferrin uptake and release. [18F]Alb data provided an independent estimate of plasma volume. Kinetic analysis showed the presence of a tissue compartment for [18F]Tf that rapidly reaches equilibrium (half time 7-10 minutes). In this organ, the measured rates for Tf turnover obtained with quantitative PET are similar to previously published data using cell culture systems. A model for [18F]Tf in the spleen was not statistically improved by adding a tissue compartment. These data and the pharmacokinetic modeling provide in vivo evidence of a high flux equilibrium binding compartment in the liver, consistent with Tf internalization and recycling.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9096608/
Positron emission tomography measures of benzodiazepine receptors in Huntington's disease,"V A Holthoff, R A Koeppe, K A Frey, J B Penney, D S Markel, D E Kuhl, A B Young","We performed positron emission tomographic (PET) measurements of the regional distribution volume of benzodiazepine receptors and regional glucose metabolism in 6 drug-free patients with early Huntington's disease following injection of [11C]flumazenil, a nonsubtype selective central benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, and 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose, respectively. Flumazenil data were analyzed with a recently developed two-compartment, two-parameter tracer kinetic model. Benzodiazepine receptor density is related to distribution volume for flumazenil. In comparison with a group of healthy volunteers, benzodiazepine receptor density was significantly decreased in the caudate nucleus. Glucose metabolism was significantly reduced not only in the caudate nucleus but also in the putamen and thalamus. The changes in benzodiazepine receptor density observed in the caudate nucleus are commensurate with data obtained in postmortem autoradiographic studies of receptor density. Based on such postmortem studies we also anticipated changes in putamen and thalamic benzodiazepine receptor density. However, relatively little is known on receptor changes in early Huntington's disease, because the autoradiographic data available were obtained mostly in patients with advanced disease. The decreased glucose metabolism in the caudate and putamen agrees well with previously published results of PET studies, whereas metabolic impairment of the thalamus has not yet been described in Huntington's disease. The present study suggests that regional metabolism and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-benzodiazepine receptor changes in subcortical structures of patients with early Huntington's disease do not occur with the same time course: Caudate benzodiazepine receptor density is already severely impaired when other subcortical structures reveal only minor abnormalities.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8390806/
Evaluation of new bone formation in normal and osteoporotic rats with a 3-mm femur defect: functional assessment with dynamic PET-CT (dPET-CT) using 2-deoxy-2-[(18)F]fluoro-D-glucose ( (18)F-FDG) and (18)F-fluoride,"Caixia Cheng, Volker Alt, Antonia Dimitrakopoulou-Strauss, Leyun Pan, Ulrich Thormann, Reinhard Schnettler, Klaus Weber, Ludwig G Strauss","Purpose: The aim of the current study was to assess the formation of new bone in a 3-mm created defect in the femur and its adjacent bone tissue in osteoporotic and normal animals. The assessment is based on bone remodeling and glucose metabolism in a rat model with a 3-mm created defct in the femur using (18)F-fluoride and 2-deoxy-2-[(18)F]fluoro-D-glucose ((18)F-FDG) as tracers for dynamic PET-CT (dPET-CT). The (18)F-fluoride PET data were compared with those of (18)F-FDG.

Procedures: Osteoporosis was induced by ovariectomy and a calcium restricted diet in each rat (n = 7). Alternatively, a sham operation was performed in the control group (n = 8). After 3 months, all rats were operated to create a 3-mm defect using an oscillating saw in the distal metaphyseal femur, which was internally fixed with a metal plate. Eighteen weeks after osteoporosis induction and 6 weeks following femoral surgery, dPET-CT studies scan were performed with (18)F-FDG and (18)F-fluoride. Following PET data acquisition, standardized uptake values (SUVs) were calculated from the tracer concentration values. Then, a two-tissue compartmental learning-machine model was applied to the data for the calculation of the compartment parameters (K1-k4, VB, Ki). Furthermore, a non-compartmental model based on the fractal dimension was applied for quantitative analysis of both groups and both tracers. Finally, multivariate analysis was performed for the statistical analysis of the kinetic data.

Results: The values for K1 and Ki were higher in the osteoporotic rats than in the control group. Ki and K1 of (18)F-fluoride in the adjacent bone tissue differ significantly based on the Wilcoxon rank-sum test for the osteoporotic and control group (p < 0.05). The sensitivity and the negative predictive value (NPV) based on linear discriminant analysis was high with a value of 100 % for both tracers and both evaluated regions (defect and adjacent bone tissue) when comparing control and osteoporotic rats. The overall accuracy with (18)F-FDG was generally higher than that with (18)F-fluoride for both evaluated regions for the control and osteoporotic rats based on a multiparameter evaluation.

Conclusion: In this study, the changes in tracer kinetics accurately discriminated differences in the created defect in the femur and its adjacent bone tissue between osteoporotic and control rats.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22965489/
Glucose transport across the blood-brain barrier in normal human subjects and patients with cerebral tumours studied using [11C]3-O-methyl-D-glucose and positron emission tomography,"D J Brooks, R P Beaney, A A Lammertsma, S Herold, D R Turton, S K Luthra, R S Frackowiak, D G Thomas, J Marshall, T Jones","The kinetics of the regional cerebral uptake of [11C]3-O-methyl-D-glucose ([11C]MeG), a competitive inhibitor of D-glucose transport, have been studied in normal human subjects and patients with cerebral tumours using positron emission tomography (PET). Concomitant measurement of regional cerebral blood volume and blood flow enabled corrections for the contribution of intravascular tracer signal in PET scans to be carried out and regional unidirectional cerebral [11C]MeG extractions to be determined. A three-compartment model containing an arterial plasma and two cerebral compartments was required to produce satisfactory fits to experimental regional cerebral [11C]MeG uptake data. Under fasting, resting conditions, normal controls had mean unidirectional whole-brain, cortical, and white matter [11C]MeG extractions of 14, 13, and 17%, respectively. Mean values of k1 and k2, first-order rate constants describing forward and back transport, respectively, of tracer into the first cerebral compartment, were similar for [11C]MeG and [18F]2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (18FDG), a second competitive inhibitor of D-glucose transport. k3, a rate constant describing FDG phosphorylation, was 20 times higher for cortical FDG uptake than the k3 fitted for [11C]MeG cortical uptake. Glioma [11C]MeG extractions ranged from normal levels of 12% to raised levels of 30%. Transport of [11C]MeG in and out of contralateral cortical tissue was significantly depressed in patients with gliomas. It is concluded that under fasting, resting conditions, regional cerebral glucose extraction remains relatively uniform throughout normal brain tissue. Gliomas, however, may have raised levels of glucose extraction. The nature of the second cerebral compartment required to describe [11C]MeG uptake is unclear, but it could represent either a useless phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle or nonspecific tracer uptake by a cerebral subcompartment.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3007547/
Assessment of cerebral P-glycoprotein expression and function with PET by combined [11C]inhibitor and [11C]substrate scans in rats,"Julia Müllauer, Rudolf Karch, Jens P Bankstahl, Marion Bankstahl, Johann Stanek, Thomas Wanek, Severin Mairinger, Markus Müller, Wolfgang Löscher, Oliver Langer, Claudia Kuntner","Introduction: The adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette (ABC) transporter P-glycoprotein (Pgp) protects the brain from accumulation of lipophilic compounds by active efflux transport across the blood-brain barrier. Changes in Pgp function/expression may occur in neurological disorders, such as epilepsy, Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease. In this work we investigated the suitability of the radiolabeled Pgp inhibitors [(11)C]elacridar and [(11)C]tariquidar to visualize Pgp density in rat brain with PET.

Methods: Rats underwent a first PET scan with [(11)C]elacridar (n = 5) or [(11)C]tariquidar (n = 6) followed by a second scan with the Pgp substrate (R)-[(11)C]verapamil after administration of unlabeled tariquidar at a dose which half-maximally inhibits cerebral Pgp (3 mg/kg). Compartmental modeling using an arterial input function and Logan graphical analysis were used to estimate rate constants and volumes of distribution (VT) of radiotracers in different brain regions.

Results: Brain PET signals of [(11)C]elacridar and [(11)C]tariquidar were very low (~0.5 standardized uptake value, SUV). There was a significant negative correlation between VT and K1 (i.e. influx rate constant from plasma into brain) values of [(11)C]elacridar or [(11)C]tariquidar and VT and K1 values of (R)-[(11)C]verapamil in different brain regions which was consistent with binding of [(11)C]inhibitors to Pgp and efflux of (R)-[(11)C]verapamil by Pgp.

Conclusion: The small Pgp binding signals obtained with [(11)C]elacridar and [(11)C]tariquidar limit the applicability of these tracers to measure cerebral Pgp density. PET tracers with higher (i.e. subnanomolar) binding affinities will be needed to visualize the low density of Pgp in brain.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23774004/
Analysis of D2 dopamine receptor occupancy with quantitative SPET using the high-affinity ligand [123I]epidepride: resolving conflicting findings,"Kjell Erlandsson, Rodrigo A Bressan, Rachel S Mulligan, Peter J Ell, Vincent J Cunningham, Lyn S Pilowsky","Recent studies of limbic cortical dopamine D(2) receptor occupancy by clozapine using high-affinity PET and SPET radioligands have produced conflicting findings. It has been suggested that these divergent findings are due to between-study differences in the method used to estimate D(2) receptor-binding potential. We compared different methods for estimating striatal and temporal cortical D(2) receptor occupancy with high-affinity tracers. In vivo experimental SPET data, obtained with [(123)I]epidepride were analysed with reference tissue kinetic modeling and with the ratio method, applied to data corresponding to short (60 min) and long (240 min) acquisition times. Dopamine D(2) receptor occupancy by the atypical antipsychotic drug risperidone was evaluated. Simulation experiments were also performed, comparing occupancy values obtained for different receptor densities in relation to different data acquisition times. The simulation results revealed that previously published data regarding errors in occupancy estimation by analysis of time activity data acquired for 60 min cannot be extrapolated to studies performed over 240 min. The ratio method provided accurate temporal cortical D(2) receptor occupancy values when applied to data from a late time period, but underestimated the occupancy with earlier data. In striatum, both the late data ratio method and reference tissue kinetic modeling using all data underestimated D(2) receptor occupancy. However, more accurate analyses of striatal D(2) occupancy still showed selective limbic/cortical occupancy by risperidone. Our results substantiate the previous [(123)I]epidepride findings of high temporal cortical occupancy by other atypical antipsychotic drugs and suggest that a potential source of conflicting findings might be short scanning times imposed by [(11)C]FLB 457, leading to underestimation of temporal cortical D(2) receptor occupancy by this method.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12880845/
The simplified reference tissue model for SPECT/PET brain receptor studies. Interpretation of its parameters,"R Buchert, F Thiele","Aim: The SRTM (simplified reference tissue model) of brain receptor imaging assumes that the time activity curve in the receptor-rich region of interest can be fitted satisfactorily by the 1-tissue compartment model. This assumption has been formulated by a rather restrictive constraint on the rate constants. Empirically, the SRTM might well describe also tracers which do not fulfil this constraint, such as [(11)C]raclopride, for example. However, this has not been justified rigorously.

Methods: The requirements for the SRTM to be applicable are analyzed in detail.

Results: The SRTM is applicable under a less restrictive constraint than described previously. The interpretation of the SRTM parameters R(1) and k(2) in physiological terms depends on the constraint, while the interpretation of BP(ND) does not.

Conclusion: Correct interpretation of the results of the SRTM is tracer specific. In particular, the parameter R(1), which in case of compliance with the original constraint might be used to detect perfusion and/or extraction effects, might not be appropriate for this purpose in case of raclopride-like tracers.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18690377/
Assessment of quantitative FDG PET data in primary colorectal tumours: which parameters are important with respect to tumour detection?,"Ludwig G Strauss, Sven Klippel, Leyun Pan, Klaus Schönleben, Uwe Haberkorn, Antonia Dimitrakopoulou-Strauss","Purpose: The impact of quantitative parameters on the differentiation of primary colorectal tumours from normal colon tissue was assessed. Dynamic PET data (DPET) were acquired, and compartment and non-compartment modelling applied. The discriminant power of single parameters and the combination of PET parameters was assessed. All lesions were confirmed by histology.

Methods: FDG DPET studies were acquired in 22 patients with colorectal tumours prior to surgery. Five of these patients also had liver metastases at the time of the PET study. The SUV 56-60 min p.i. was included in the evaluation. A two-tissue compartment model was applied and the parameters k1-k4 as well as the fractional blood volume (VB) were obtained. The FDG influx was calculated from the compartment data. Non-compartment modelling was used to calculate the fractal dimension (FD) of the time-activity data.

Results: FD, SUV, influx and k3 were the most important single parameters for lesion differentiation. The highest accuracy was achieved for FD (88.78%). The overall tracer uptake was mainly dependent on k3 and not on k1 or VB. The support vector machines (SVM) algorithm was used to predict the classification based on the combination of individual PET parameters. The overall accuracy was 97.3%, with only one false positive case and no false negative results. The analysis of the subgroup of five patients with primary tumours and synchronous metastases revealed no significant differences for the individual PET parameters. However, VB tended to be lower while k1 and k2 were higher in patients with synchronous metastases. The SVM classification analysis predicted the presence of metastases based on the PET data of the primary tumour in three of five patients.

Conclusion: Quantitative FDG PET studies provide very accurate data for the differentiation of primary colorectal tumours from normal tissue. The use of quantitative data has the advantage that the detection of a colorectal tumour is not primarily dependent on the individual assessment and experience of the physician evaluating the FDG PET data only visually. The results suggest that the presence of metastatic lesions may be predicted by analysis of the dynamic PET data of the corresponding primary tumour. Further studies are needed to assess this aspect in detail.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17219134/
Preclinical evaluation and quantification of [¹⁸F]MK-9470 as a radioligand for PET imaging of the type 1 cannabinoid receptor in rat brain,"Cindy Casteels, Michel Koole, Sofie Celen, Guy Bormans, Koen Van Laere","Purpose: [(18)F]MK-9470 is an inverse agonist for the type 1 cannabinoid (CB1) receptor allowing its use in PET imaging. We characterized the kinetics of [(18)F]MK-9470 and evaluated its ability to quantify CB1 receptor availability in the rat brain.

Methods: Dynamic small-animal PET scans with [(18)F]MK-9470 were performed in Wistar rats on a FOCUS-220 system for up to 10 h. Both plasma and perfused brain homogenates were analysed using HPLC to quantify radiometabolites. Displacement and blocking experiments were done using cold MK-9470 and another inverse agonist, SR141716A. The distribution volume (V(T)) of [(18)F]MK-9470 was used as a quantitative measure and compared to the use of brain uptake, expressed as SUV, a simplified method of quantification.

Results: The percentage of intact [(18)F]MK-9470 in arterial plasma samples was 80 ± 23 % at 10 min, 38 ± 30 % at 40 min and 13 ± 14 % at 210 min. A polar radiometabolite fraction was detected in plasma and brain tissue. The brain radiometabolite concentration was uniform across the whole brain. Displacement and pretreatment studies showed that 56 % of the tracer binding was specific and reversible. V (T) values obtained with a one-tissue compartment model plus constrained radiometabolite input had good identifiability (≤10 %). Ignoring the radiometabolite contribution using a one-tissue compartment model alone, i.e. without constrained radiometabolite input, overestimated the [(18)F]MK-9470 V(T), but was correlated. A correlation between [(18)F]MK-9470 V(T) and SUV in the brain was also found (R(2) = 0.26-0.33; p ≤ 0.03).

Conclusion: While the presence of a brain-penetrating radiometabolite fraction complicates the quantification of [(18)F]MK-9470 in the rat brain, its tracer kinetics can be modelled using a one-tissue compartment model with and without constrained radiometabolite input.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22699528/
Parametric Imaging and Test-Retest Variability of ¹¹C-(+)-PHNO Binding to D₂/D₃ Dopamine Receptors in Humans on the High-Resolution Research Tomograph PET Scanner,"Jean-Dominique Gallezot, Ming-Qiang Zheng, Keunpoong Lim, Shu-fei Lin, David Labaree, David Matuskey, Yiyun Huang, Yu-Shin Ding, Richard E Carson, Robert T Malison","(11)C-(+)-4-propyl-9-hydroxynaphthoxazine ((11)C-(+)-PHNO) is an agonist radioligand for imaging dopamine D2 and D3 receptors in the human brain with PET. In this study we evaluated the reproducibility of (11)C-(+)-PHNO binding parameters using a within-day design and assessed parametric imaging methods.

Methods: Repeated studies were performed in 8 subjects, with simultaneous measurement of the arterial input function and plasma free fraction. Two (11)C-(+)-PHNO scans for the same subject were separated by 5.4 ± 0.7 h. After compartment models were evaluated, (11)C-(+)-PHNO volumes of distribution (V(T)) and binding potentials relative to the concentration of tracer in plasma (BP(P)), nondisplaceable tracer in tissue (BP(ND)), and free tracer in tissue (BP(F)) were quantified using the multilinear analysis MA1 method, with the cerebellum as the reference region. Parametric images of BP(ND) were also computed using the simplified reference tissue model (SRTM) and SRTM2.

Results: The test-retest variability of (11)C-(+)-PHNO BP(ND) was 9% in D2-rich regions (caudate and putamen). Among D3-rich regions, variability was low in the pallidum (6%) but higher in substantia nigra (19%), thalamus (14%), and hypothalamus (21%). No significant mass carry-over effect was observed in D3-rich regions, although a trend in BP(ND) was present in the substantia nigra (-14% ± 15%). Because of the relatively fast kinetics, low-noise BP(ND) parametric images were obtained with both SRTM and SRTM2 without spatial smoothing.

Conclusion: (11)C-(+)-PHNO can be used to compute low-noise parametric images in both D2- and D3-rich regions in humans.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24732151/
Models for in vivo kinetic interactions of dopamine D2-neuroreceptors and 3-(2'-[18F]fluoroethyl)spiperone examined with positron emission tomography,"M M Bahn, S C Huang, R A Hawkins, N Satyamurthy, J M Hoffman, J R Barrio, J C Mazziotta, M E Phelps","The in vivo tracer kinetics of 3-(2'-[18F]fluoroethyl)spiperone (FESP) in the caudate/striatum and cerebellar regions of the human and monkey brain were studied with positron emission tomography (PET). The minimal model configuration that can describe the kinetics was determined statistically. Three two-compartment model configurations were found to be suitable for describing the kinetics in caudate/striatum and cerebellum: (1) a nonlinear model (five parameters) applicable to studies using nontracer (partially saturating) quantities of FESP in monkey striatum, (2) a linear four-parameter model applicable to the caudate/striatal and cerebellar kinetics in human and monkey studies with tracer quantities of FESP, and (3) a linear three-parameter model derived from the four-parameter model by assuming irreversible binding applicable to tracer studies of the human caudate. In the human studies, when the caudate kinetics (n = 4) were fit by model 2 (with four parameters), the value of the in vivo ligand dissociation constant kd was found to be 0.0015 +/- 0.0032/min. The three-parameter model (model 3) was found to fit the data equally well: this model is equivalent to model 2 with kd set to zero. In the monkey studies, it was found that for short (90 min) studies using tracer quantities of FESP, model 2 fit the striatal kinetics better than model 3. The parameters estimated using model 2 (four parameters) were in better agreement with those estimated by the nonlinear model (model 1) than those estimated using model 3 (three parameters). The use of a graphical approach gives estimates of the plasma-tissue fractional transport rate constant K1 and the net uptake constant K3 comparable to estimates using model 3 for both human and monkey studies.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2531147/
A non-linear mixed effect modelling approach for metabolite correction of the arterial input function in PET studies,"Mattia Veronese, Roger N Gunn, Stefano Zamuner, Alessandra Bertoldo","Quantitative PET studies with arterial blood sampling usually require the correction of the measured total plasma activity for the presence of metabolites. In particular, if labelled metabolites are found in the plasma in significant amounts their presence has to be accounted for, because it is the concentration of the parent tracer which is required for data quantification. This is achieved by fitting a Parent Plasma fraction (PPf) model to discrete metabolite measurements. The commonly used method is based on an individual approach, i.e. for each subject the PPf model parameters are estimated from its own metabolite samples, which are, in general, sparse and noisy. This fact can compromise the quality of the reconstructed arterial input functions, and, consequently, affect the quantification of tissue kinetic parameters. In this study, we proposed a Non-Linear Mixed Effect Modelling (NLMEM) approach to describe metabolite kinetics. Since NLMEM has been developed to provide robust parameter estimates in the case of sparse and/or noisy data, it has the potential to be a reliable method for plasma metabolite correction. Three different PET datasets were considered: [11C]-(+)-PHNO (54 scans), [11C]-PIB (22 scans) and [11C]-DASB (30 scans). For each tracer both simulated and measured data were considered and NLMEM performance was compared with that provided by individual analysis. Results showed that NLMEM provided improved estimates of the plasma parent input function over the individual approach when the metabolite data were sparse or contained outliers.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23108277/
Evaluation of the metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5 using PET and 11C-ABP688: assessment of methods,"Valerie Treyer, Johannes Streffer, Matthias T Wyss, Andrea Bettio, Simon M Ametamey, Uta Fischer, Mark Schmidt, Fabrizio Gasparini, Christoph Hock, Alfred Buck","(11)C-ABP688 is a new PET ligand to assess the subtype 5 metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGlu(5)). The purpose of this study was to evaluate different methods for the analysis of human (11)C-ABP688 data acquired from 6 healthy, young volunteers.

Methods: The methods were a 1-tissue-compartment model (K(1), k(2)''), a 2-tissue-compartment model (K1-k4), and the noncompartmental method developed by Logan. Parameters related to receptor density were the total distribution volume (DV), DV'' (= K(1)/k(2)'', 1 tissue compartment); specific DV, DV(C2) (= K(1)/k(2)' x k(3)'/k(4), 2 tissue compartments); and DV(tot) for the noncompartmental method.

Results: The 1-tissue-compartment model was too simple to adequately fit the data. DV(C2) calculated with the 2-tissue-compartment model ranged from 5.45 +/- 1.47 (anterior cingulate) to 1.91 +/- 0.32 (cerebellum). The corresponding values for DV(tot), calculated with the 2-tissue-compartment model and the Logan method (in parentheses), were 6.57 +/- 1.45 (6.35 +/- 1.32) and 2.93 +/- 0.53 (2.48 +/- 0.40). There was no clear evidence of a region devoid of mGlu(5) receptors. The first-pass extraction fraction exceeded 95%. The minimal scan duration to obtain stable results was estimated to be 45 min.

Conclusion: (11)C-ABP688 displays favorable kinetics for assessing mGlu(5) receptors. For tracer kinetic modeling, 2-tissue-compartment models are clearly superior to models with only 1 tissue compartment. In comparison to the compartmental models, the Logan method is equally useful if only DV(tot) values are required and fast pixelwise parametric maps are desired. The lack of regions devoid of receptors limits the use of reference region methods that do not require arterial blood sampling. Another advantage of the tracer is the fast kinetics that allow for relatively short acquisitions.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17574984/
Assessing non-invasive quantitative methods for [18F]SynVesT-1 PET imaging of synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A in the rat brain,"Lori Berckmans, Claudia Schrauwen, Alan Miranda, Steven Staelens, Daniele Bertoglio","Purpose: Synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A) is a critical biomarker for evaluating synaptic density in neurological research. Among available radioligands, [18F]SynVesT-1 is increasingly used in PET research because of its extended half-life, while having comparable pharmacokinetic properties to the widely used [11C]UCB-J. However, quantitative application in rat models remains unexplored for [18F]SynVesT-1. This study aims to validate quantitative kinetic modelling methods for [18F]SynVesT-1 and develop non-invasive quantification methods for synaptic density in rats.

Methods: First, blood analysis of [18F]SynVesT-1 was performed to generate metabolite-corrected plasma input functions. Then, kinetic modelling was evaluated using compartmental analysis approaches, as well as Logan plot. Furthermore, non-invasive image-derived input functions (IDIF), with and without non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) were compared against the arterial input function (AIF).

Results: Blood analysis showed that the parent fraction of the tracer decreased over time following a sigmoid curve, while the plasma-to-whole blood ratio remained stable over time (0.89 ± 0.02). The two-tissue compartmental model (2TCM) and Logan plot were determined to be the most accurate methods for quantification of [18F]SynVesT-1 kinetics in rats. Additionally, the results demonstrated strong agreement between AIF-derived and image-derived volume of distribution (VT) values, with both image-derived input approaches (IDIF and IDIF-NMF) performing equally well.

Conclusion: These findings validate kinetic modelling methods for [18F]SynVesT-1 PET, enabling their application in further rat studies for preclinical neuroscience research and prove that image-derived input functions are reliable non-invasive alternatives to AIF.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40032689/
A method to predict the ratio of the tracer conversion rate to the tracer back-diffusion rate of an irreversible-type radiotracer in humans by preclinical evaluations,"Tomoyuki Ohya, Ming-Rong Zhang, Toshimitsu Fukumura, Kiyoshi Fukushi, Tatsuya Kikuchi, Toshiaki Irie","Objective: The aim of this study was to develop a method to predict a tracer's α-value in the human brain on the basis of animal data. The α-value is the ratio of the conversion rate and the back-diffusion rate (k3/k2) and is one of the critical kinetic features of the detection sensitivity of target molecule activity, such as enzyme activity, in the measurement of PET and single-photon emission computed tomography using an irreversible-type radiotracer.

Method: The α-value in the rat brain was estimated by a simultaneous assay of the tracer uptake and the target biochemical activity using N-[C]-methylpiperidin-4-yl acetate ([C]MP4A) and N-[C]-methylpiperidin-4-yl propionate ([C]MP4P) as test tracers, both of which are metabolic trapping tracers for measurement of brain acetylcholinesterase. The α-value in humans was then extrapolated from the α-value in rats by considering the differences between the species. The predicted human α-values were compared with those obtained from the kinetic analyses of human PET studies using [C]MP4A and [C]MP4P.

Result: The α-values in the human brain cortex were predicted to be 0.51±0.1 for MP4A and 0.25±0.05 for MP4P. These results were close to values reported in other PET studies: 0.48±0.1 to 0.73±0.2 for MP4A and 0.15±0.04 to 0.18±0.04 for MP4P.

Conclusion: The α-value predicted by this method would be used for practical selection or development of irreversible-type radiotracers for human use.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22850605/
Interstitial diffusion and the relationship between compartment modelling and multi-scale spatial-temporal modelling of (18)F-FLT tumour uptake dynamics,"Dan Liu, Anastasia Chalkidou, David B Landau, Paul K Marsden, John D Fenwick","Tumour cell proliferation can be imaged via positron emission tomography of the radiotracer 3'-deoxy-3'-18F-fluorothymidine (18F-FLT). Conceptually, the number of proliferating cells might be expected to correlate more closely with the kinetics of 18F-FLT uptake than with uptake at a fixed time. Radiotracer uptake kinetics are standardly visualized using parametric maps of compartment model fits to time-activity-curves (TACs) of individual voxels. However the relationship between the underlying spatiotemporal accumulation of FLT and the kinetics described by compartment models has not yet been explored. In this work tumour tracer uptake is simulated using a mechanistic spatial-temporal model based on a convection-diffusion-reaction equation solved via the finite difference method. The model describes a chain of processes: the flow of FLT between the spatially heterogeneous tumour vasculature and interstitium; diffusion and convection of FLT within the interstitium; transport of FLT into cells; and intracellular phosphorylation. Using values of model parameters estimated from the biological literature, simulated FLT TACs are generated with shapes and magnitudes similar to those seen clinically. Results show that the kinetics of the spatial-temporal model can be recovered accurately by fitting a 3-tissue compartment model to FLT TACs simulated for those tumours or tumour sub-volumes that can be viewed as approximately closed, for which tracer diffusion throughout the interstitium makes only a small fractional change to the quantity of FLT they contain. For a single PET voxel of width 2.5-5 mm we show that this condition is roughly equivalent to requiring that the relative difference in tracer uptake between the voxel and its neighbours is much less than one.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25138724/
Kinetics and metabolism of apocynin in the mouse brain assessed with positron-emission tomography,"Toshimitsu Okamura, Maki Okada, Tatsuya Kikuchi, Hidekatsu Wakizaka, Ming-Rong Zhang","Background: Apocynin is a constituent of the medicinal herb Picrorhiza kurroa. It is an inhibitor of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase. This compound shows potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects and has been tested as a neuroprotectant in many animal models of brain disease. In such studies, understanding the brain kinetics of apocynin would be important for interpreting its in vivo efficacy; however, little has been reported on the kinetics of apocynin in the brain.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to investigate the kinetics and metabolism of apocynin in the brain of mice.

Study design: The kinetics and metabolism of apocynin were examined using [11C]apocynin and positron-emission tomography (PET).

Methods: In vivo PET scanning was performed in mice for 20min after intraperitoneal administration of an apocynin solution containing [11C]apocynin. Metabolites in the brain were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography. The doses of apocynin used ranged from <1.5 µg/kg (tracer dose) to 100mg/kg.

Results: Brain radioactivity during the period of 0 to 20min after administration was negligible at the tracer dose and extremely low at the dose of 10mg/kg. Moderate radioactivity was observed in the brain a few minutes after administration at the doses of 25 and 50mg/kg and rapidly decreased thereafter. At a dose of 100mg/kg, [11C]apocynin resulted in a high uptake of radioactivity followed by a gradual washout. In contrast to the brain, a clear dose-dependent increase in radioactivity was not observed in the blood. The fraction of the unchanged form in the brain decreased with time, and the degree of the reduction depended on apocynin doses: apocynin was rapidly metabolized in the brain at lower doses, whereas it was slowly decomposed at higher doses. On the basis of these data, the maximum apocynin concentrations in the brain were calculated to be 10 µM (10mg/kg), 49 µM (25mg/kg), 150 µM (50mg/kg), and 380 µM (100mg/kg). A metabolite observed in the brain was found to be apocynin glucuronide but not diapocynin, an active metabolite.

Conclusion: These results would be useful for an evaluation of the potential efficacy of apocynin as a neuroprotective agent.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29425658/
Quantification of delta-opioid receptors in human brain with N1'-([11C]methyl) naltrindole and positron emission tomography,"J S Smith, J K Zubieta, J C Price, J E Flesher, I Madar, J R Lever, C M Kinter, R F Dannals, J J Frost","The regional binding of N1'-([11C]methyl)naltrindole (MeNTI), a selective delta-opioid antagonist, was studied in healthy human subjects with positron emission tomography (PET). After the bolus intravenous administration of high specific activity [11C]MeNTI, PET was performed over 90 minutes. Arterial plasma samples were obtained during the scanning period and assayed for the presence of radiolabeled metabolites. The data were analyzed with various kinetic (two- and three-compartment models, Patlak graphical analysis) and nonkinetic (apparent volume of distribution and activity at a late scanning time) approaches. This tracer showed irreversible binding characteristics during the scanning period used. The results of the analyses also were compared with the density and distribution of delta-opioid receptors in the human brain in vitro. Additionally, computer simulations were performed to assess the effects of changes in receptor binding and tracer transport changes on the perceived binding parameters obtained with the models. A constrained three-compartment kinetic model was demonstrated to be superior to other quantification models for the description of MeNTI kinetics and quantification of delta receptor binding in the human brain with 11C-labeled MeNTI.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10478647/
18 F-fluoromisonidazole uptake in advanced stage non-small cell lung cancer: A voxel-by-voxel PET kinetics study,"Daniel R McGowan, Ruth E Macpherson, Sara L Hackett, Dan Liu, Fergus V Gleeson, W Gillies McKenna, Geoff S Higgins, John D Fenwick","Purpose: The aim of this study was to determine the relative abilities of compartment models to describe time-courses of18F-fluoromisonidazole (FMISO) uptake in tumor voxels of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) imaged using dynamic positron emission tomography. Also to use fits of the best-performing model to investigate changes in fitted rate-constants with distance from the tumor edge.

Methods: Reversible and irreversible two- and three-tissue compartment models were fitted to 24 662 individual voxel time activity curves (TACs) obtained from tumors in nine patients, each imaged twice. Descriptions of the TACs provided by the models were compared using the Akaike and Bayesian information criteria (AIC and BIC). Two different models (two- and three-tissue) were fitted to 30 measured voxel TACs to provide ground-truth TACs for a statistical simulation study. Appropriately scaled noise was added to each of the resulting ground-truth TACs, generating 1000 simulated noisy TACs for each ground-truth TAC. The simulation study was carried out to provide estimates of the accuracy and precision with which parameter values are determined, the estimates being obtained for both assumptions about the ground-truth kinetics. A BIC clustering technique was used to group the fitted rate-constants, taking into consideration the underlying uncertainties on the fitted rate-constants. Voxels were also categorized according to their distance from the tumor edge.

Results: For uptake time-courses of individual voxels an irreversible two-tissue compartment model was found to be most precise. The simulation study indicated that this model had a one standard deviation precision of 39% for tumor fractional blood volumes and 37% for the FMISO binding rate-constant. Weighted means of fitted FMISO binding rate-constants of voxels in all tumors rose significantly with increasing distance from the tumor edge, whereas fitted fractional blood volumes fell significantly. When grouped using the BIC clustering, many centrally located voxels had high-fitted FMISO binding rate-constants and low rate-constants for tracer flow between the vasculature and tumor, both indicative of hypoxia. Nevertheless, many of these voxels had tumor-to-blood (TBR) values lower than the 1.4 level commonly expected for hypoxic tissues, possibly due to the low rate-constants for tracer flow between the vasculature and tumor cells in these voxels.

Conclusions: Time-courses of FMISO uptake in NSCLC tumor voxels are best analyzed using an irreversible two-tissue compartment model, fits of which provide more precise parameter values than those of a three-tissue model. Changes in fitted model parameter values indicate that levels of hypoxia rise with increasing distance from tumor edges. The average FMISO binding rate-constant is higher for voxels in tumor centers than in the next tumor layer out, but the average value of the more simplistic TBR metric is lower in tumor centers. For both metrics, higher values might be considered indicative of hypoxia, and the mismatch in this case is likely to be due to poor perfusion at the tumor center. Kinetics analysis of dynamic PET images may therefore provide more accurate measures of the hypoxic status of such regions than the simpler TBR metric, a hypothesis we are presently exploring in a study of tumor imaging versus histopathology.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28644546/
A generalised spatio-temporal registration framework for dynamic PET data: application to neuroreceptor imaging,"Jieqing Jiao, Julia A Schnabel, Roger N Gunn","This work presents a novel pharmacokinetic model based registration algorithm for the motion correction of dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) images. The algorithm employs a generalised model that derives the input function from the tomographic data itself to model the PET tracer kinetics and thus eliminates the need of arterial blood sampling. Both the temporal constraint from the tracer kinetic behaviour and spatial constraint from the image similarity are integrated in a joint probabilistic model, in which the subject motion and tracer kinetic parameters are iteratively optimised, leading to a group-wise registration framework of motion corrupted dynamic PET data. The algorithm is evaluated with simulated and measured human dopamine D3 receptor imaging data using [11C]-(+)-PHNO. The simulation-based validation demonstrates that the new algorithm has a subvoxel registration accuracy on average for noisy data with simulated motion artefacts. The algorithm also shows reductions in motion on initial experiments with measured clinical [11C]-(+)-PHNO brain data.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24505668/
Determinants of [13N]ammonia kinetics in hepatic PET experiments: a minimal recirculatory model,"Michael Weiss, Klaus Roelsgaard, Dirk Bender, Susanne Keiding","The aim of this study was the development of a modelling approach for the analysis of the systemic kinetics of the tracer nitrogen-13 ammonia administered for dynamic liver scanning. The radioactive half-life of this tracer is 9.8 min, which limits the time span in which data are available in a positron emission tomography experimental setting. A circulatory pharmacokinetic model was applied to the metabolism of ammonia in anaesthetised pigs, which incorporated data from serial measurements of [(13)N]ammonia and [(13)N]metabolite activity in arterial and portal venous blood together with blood flow rates through the portal vein and through the hepatic artery obtained over 20 min after intravenous injection of [(13)N]ammonia. Model analysis showed that up to 20 min after injection the time course of [(13)N]ammonia concentration in arterial blood is primarily determined by distribution kinetics (steady-state volume of distribution 1,856+/-531 ml kg(-1)). Simultaneous fitting of arterial ammonia and metabolite blood concentrations allowed for estimation of the hepatic [(13)N]ammonia clearance (10.25+/-1.84 ml min(-1) kg(-1)), which accounted for the formation of the circulating metabolites.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12458400/
Multisoftware reproducibility study of stress and rest myocardial blood flow assessed with 3D dynamic PET/CT and a 1-tissue-compartment model of 82Rb kinetics,"Robert A Dekemp, Jerome Declerck, Ran Klein, Xiao-Bo Pan, Ryo Nakazato, Christine Tonge, Parthiban Arumugam, Daniel S Berman, Guido Germano, Rob S Beanlands, Piotr J Slomka","Routine quantification of myocardial blood flow (MBF) requires robust and reproducible processing of dynamic image series. The goal of this study was to evaluate the reproducibility of 3 highly automated software programs commonly used for absolute MBF and flow reserve (stress/rest MBF) assessment with (82)Rb PET imaging.

Methods: Dynamic rest and stress (82)Rb PET scans were selected in 30 sequential patient studies performed at 3 separate institutions using 3 different 3-dimensional PET/CT scanners. All 90 scans were processed with 3 different MBF quantification programs, using the same 1-tissue-compartment model. Global (left ventricle) and regional (left anterior descending, left circumflex, and right coronary arteries) MBF and flow reserve were compared among programs using correlation and Bland-Altman analyses.

Results: All scans were processed successfully by the 3 programs, with minimal operator interactions. Global and regional correlations of MBF and flow reserve all had an R(2) of at least 0.92. There was no significant difference in flow values at rest (P = 0.68), stress (P = 0.14), or reserve (P = 0.35) among the 3 programs. Bland-Altman coefficients of reproducibility (1.96 × SD) averaged 0.26 for MBF and 0.29 for flow reserve differences among programs. Average pairwise differences were all less than 10%, indicating good reproducibility for MBF quantification. Global and regional SD from the line of perfect agreement averaged 0.15 and 0.17 mL/min/g, respectively, for MBF, compared with 0.22 and 0.26, respectively, for flow reserve.

Conclusion: The 1-tissue-compartment model of (82)Rb tracer kinetics is a reproducible method for quantification of MBF and flow reserve with 3-dimensional PET/CT imaging.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23447656/
Strategies for in vivo measurement of receptor binding using positron emission tomography,"J S Perlmutter, K B Larson, M E Raichle, J Markham, M A Mintun, M R Kilbourn, M J Welch","Dopaminergic ligands labeled with positron-emitting radionuclides have been synthesized for quantitative evaluation of dopaminergic binding in vivo. Two different methods, the explicit method and an operationally simplified ratio method, have been proposed for analysis of these positron emission tomographic (PET) data. The basis for both methods is the same three-compartment model. The two methods differ in the assumptions necessary for practical implementation. We have compared these two approaches using PET data obtained in our laboratory. Sequential scans and serial arterial blood samples from a baboon following intravenous injection of [18F]spiroperidol were collected. Application of the two methods to the same data yielded different values for corresponding parameters. Values calculated by the ratio method for the specific rate constant describing receptor binding varied depending upon the time after tracer injection, thus demonstrating an internal inconsistency in this approach. Tracer metabolism markedly affected the binding measurements calculated with either method and thus cannot be ignored. Our results indicate that the adoption of simplifying assumptions for operational convenience can lead to substantial errors and must be done with caution. Alternatively, we present simple new analytical solutions of the tracer conservation equations describing the complete, unsimplified three-compartment model that vastly reduce the computations necessary to implement the explicit method.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3485640/
"Simultaneous blood-tissue exchange of oxygen, carbon dioxide, bicarbonate, and hydrogen ion","Ranjan K Dash, James B Bassingthwaighte","A detailed nonlinear four-region (red blood cell, plasma, interstitial fluid, and parenchymal cell) axially distributed convection-diffusion-permeation-reaction-binding computational model is developed to study the simultaneous transport and exchange of oxygen (O2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) in the blood-tissue exchange system of the heart. Since the pH variation in blood and tissue influences the transport and exchange of O2 and CO2 (Bohr and Haldane effects), and since most CO2 is transported as HCO3(-) (bicarbonate) via the CO2 hydration (buffering) reaction, the transport and exchange of HCO3(-) and H+ are also simulated along with that of O2 and CO2. Furthermore, the model accounts for the competitive nonlinear binding of O2 and CO2 with the hemoglobin inside the red blood cells (nonlinear O2-CO2 interactions, Bohr and Haldane effects), and myoglobin-facilitated transport of O2 inside the parenchymal cells. The consumption of O2 through cytochrome-c oxidase reaction inside the parenchymal cells is based on Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The corresponding production of CO2 is determined by respiratory quotient (RQ), depending on the relative consumption of carbohydrate, protein, and fat. The model gives a physiologically realistic description of O2 transport and metabolism in the microcirculation of the heart. Furthermore, because model solutions for tracer transients and steady states can be computed highly efficiently, this model may be the preferred vehicle for routine data analysis where repetitive solutions and parameter optimization are required, as is the case in PET imaging for estimating myocardial O2 consumption.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16775761/
Strategies to improve neuroreceptor parameter estimation by linear regression analysis,"Masanori Ichise, Hiroshi Toyama, Robert B Innis, Richard E Carson","In an attempt to improve neuroreceptor distribution volume (V) estimates, the authors evaluated three alternative linear methods to Logan graphical analysis (GA): GA using total least squares (TLS), and two multilinear analyses, MA1 and MA2, based on mathematical rearrangement of GA equation and two-tissue compartments, respectively, using simulated and actual PET data of two receptor tracers, [(18)F]FCWAY and [(11)C]MDL 100,907. For simulations, all three methods decreased the noise-induced GA bias (up to 30%) at the expense of increased variability. The bias reduction was most pronounced for MA1, moderate to large for MA2, and modest to moderate for TLS. In addition, GA, TLS, and MA1, methods that used only a portion of the data (T > t*, chosen by an automatic process), showed a small underestimation for [(11)C]MDL 100,907 with its slow kinetics, due to selection of t* before the true point of linearity. These noniterative methods are computationally simple, allowing efficient pixelwise parameter estimation. For tracers with kinetics that permit t* to be accurately identified within the study duration, MA1 appears to be the best. For tracers with slow kinetics and low to moderate noise, however, MA2 may provide the lowest bias while maintaining computational ease for pixelwise parameter estimation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12368666/
Comparative evaluation of two glycine transporter 1 radiotracers [11C]GSK931145 and [18F]MK-6577 in baboons,"Ming-Qiang Zheng, Shu-Fei Lin, Daniel Holden, Mika Naganawa, Jim R Ropchan, Soheila Najafzaden, Michael Kapinos, Mike Tabriz, Richard E Carson, Terence G Hamill, Yiyun Huang","Glycine transporter type-1 (GlyT1) has been proposed as a target for drug development for schizophrenia. PET imaging with a GlyT1 specific radiotracer will allow for the measurement of target occupancy of GlyT1 inhibitors, and for in vivo investigation of GlyT1 alterations in schizophrenia. We conducted a comparative evaluation of two GlyT1 radiotracers, [(11) C]GSK931145, and [(18) F]MK-6577, in baboons. Two baboons were imaged with [(11) C]GSK931145 and [(18) F]MK-6577. Blocking studies with GSK931145 (0.3 or 0.2 mg/kg) were conducted to determine the level of tracer specific binding. [(11) C]GSK931145 and [(18) F]MK-6577 were synthesized in good yield and high specific activity. Moderately fast metabolism was observed for both tracers, with ∼ 30% of parent at 30 min post-injection. In the brain, both radiotracers showed good uptake and distribution profiles consistent with regional GlyT1 densities. [(18) F]MK-6577 displayed higher uptake and faster kinetics than [(11) C]GSK931145. Time activity curves were well described by the two-tissue compartment model. Regional volume of distribution (VT ) values were higher for [(18) F]MK-6577 than [(11) C]GSK931145. Pretreatment with GSK931145 reduced tracer uptake to a homogeneous level throughout the brain, indicating in vivo binding specificity and lack of a reference region for both radiotracers. Linear regression analysis of VT estimates between tracers indicated higher specific binding for [(18) F]MK-6577 than [(11) C]GSK931145, consistent with higher regional binding potential (BPND ) values of [(18) F]MK-6577 calculated using VT from the baseline scans and non-displaceable distribution volume (VND ) derived from blocking studies. [(18) F]MK-6577 appears to be a superior radiotracer with higher brain uptake, faster kinetics, and higher specific binding signals than [(11) C]GSK931145.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26671330/
Autoradiography of Intracerebral Tumours in the Chick Embryo Model: A Feasibility Study Using Different PET Tracers,"Sandra Krause, Alexandru Florea, Chang-Hoon Choi, Wieland A Worthoff, Alexander Heinzel, Saskia Fischer, Nicole Burda, Bernd Neumaier, N Jon Shah, Philipp Lohmann, Felix M Mottaghy, Karl-Josef Langen, Carina Stegmayr","Purpose: In addition to rodent models, the chick embryo model has gained attention for radiotracer evaluation. Previous studies have investigated tumours on the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM), but its value for radiotracer imaging of intracerebral tumours has yet to be demonstrated.

Procedures: Human U87 glioblastoma cells and U87-IDH1 mutant glioma cells were implanted into the brains of chick embryos at developmental day 5. After 12-14 days of tumour growth, blood-brain-barrier integrity was evaluated in vivo using MRI contrast enhancement or ex vivo with Evans blue dye. The tracers O-(2-[18F]fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine ([18F]FET) (n = 5), 3,4-dihydroxy-6-[18F]-fluoro-L-phenylalanine ([18F]FDOPA) (n = 3), or [68Ga] labelled quinoline-based small molecule fibroblast activation protein inhibitor ([68Ga]FAPI-46) (n = 4) were injected intravenously if solid tumours were detected with MRI. For time-activity curves for [18F]FET, additional micro PET (µPET) was performed. The chick embryos were sacrificed 60 min post-injection, and cryosections of the tumour-bearing brains were produced and evaluated with autoradiography and immunohistochemistry.

Results: Intracerebral tumours were produced with a 100% success rate in viable chick embryos at the experimental endpoint. However, 52% of chick embryos (n = 85) did not survive the procedure to embryonic development day 20. For the evaluated radiotracers, the tumour-to-brain ratios (TBR) derived from ex vivo autoradiography, as well as the tracer kinetics derived from µPET for intracerebral chick embryo tumours, were comparable to those previously reported in rodents and patients: the TBRmean for [18F]FET was 1.69 ± 0.54 (n = 5), and 3.8 for one hypermetabolic tumour and < 2.0 for two isometabolic tumors using [18F]FDOPA, with a TBRmean of 1.92 ± 1,11 (n = 3). The TBRmean of [68Ga]FAPI-46 for intracerebral chick embryo tumours was 19.13 ± 0.64 (n = 4). An intact blood-tumour barrier was observed in one U87-MG tumour (n = 5).

Conclusions: Radiotracer imaging of intracerebral tumours in the chick embryo offers a fast model for the evaluation of radiotracer uptake, accumulation, and kinetics. Our results indicate a high comparability between intracerebral tumour imaging in chick embryos and xenograft rodent models or brain tumour patients.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39838234/
Reproducibility of O-(2-(18)F-fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine uptake kinetics in brain tumors and influence of corticoid therapy: an experimental study in rat gliomas,"Carina Stegmayr, Michael Schöneck, Dennis Oliveira, Antje Willuweit, Christian Filss, Norbert Galldiks, N Jon Shah, Heinz H Coenen, Karl-Josef Langen","Purpose: Positron emission tomography (PET) using O-(2-(18)F-fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine ((18)F-FET) is a well-established method for the diagnostics of brain tumors. This study investigates reproducibility of (18)F-FET uptake kinetics in rat gliomas and the influence of the frequently used dexamethasone (Dex) therapy.

Methods: F98 glioma or 9L gliosarcoma cells were implanted into the striatum of 31 Fischer rats. After 10-11 days of tumor growth, the animals underwent dynamic PET after injection of (18)F-FET (baseline). Thereafter, animals were divided into a control group and a group receiving Dex injections, and all animals were reinvestigated 2 days later. Tumor-to-brain ratios (TBR) of (18)F-FET uptake (18-61 min p.i.) and the slope of the time-activity-curves (TAC) (18-61 min p.i.) were evaluated using a Volume-of-Interest (VOI) analysis. Data were analyzed by two-way repeated measures ANOVA and reproducibility by the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC).

Results: The slope of the tumor TACs showed high reproducibility with an ICC of 0.93. A systematic increase of the TBR in the repeated scans was noted (3.7 ± 2.8 %; p < 0.01), and appeared to be related to tumor growth as indicated by a significant correlation of TBR and tumor volume (r = 0.77; p < 0.0001). After correction for tumor growth TBR showed high longitudinal stability with an ICC of 0.84. Dex treatment induced a significant decrease of the TBR (-8.2 ± 6.1 %; p < 0.03), but did not influence the slope of the tumor TAC.

Conclusion: TBR of (18)F-FET uptake and tracer kinetics in brain tumors showed high longitudinal stability. Dex therapy may induce a minor decrease of the TBR; this needs further investigation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26646781/
Early effects of FOLFOX treatment of colorectal tumour in an animal model: assessment of changes in gene expression and FDG kinetics,"Ludwig G Strauss, Johannes Hoffend, Dirk Koczan, Leyun Pan, Uwe Haberkorn, Antonia Dimitrakopoulou-Strauss","Purpose: The very early chemotherapeutic effects of the FOLFOX (fluorouracil, folinic acid, oxaliplatin) protocol were assessed in mice implanted with a human colorectal cell line. The aim of this study was to identify changes in gene expression patterns and to detect combinations of PET parameters that may be helpful in identifying treated tumours early after chemotherapy using dynamic PET studies.

Methods: A human colorectal cell line (HCT 116) was used in nude mice. Dynamic PET studies were performed in untreated (n = 13) and treated (n = 12) animals. The data were assessed using compartmental and noncompartmental analysis. The removed tumour specimens were assessed by gene array analysis to obtain quantitative information on gene expression.

Results: One chemotherapeutic treatment using the FOLFOX protocol resulted in an upregulation of 2,078 gene probes by more than 25%, while 2,254 probes were downregulated following treatment. The gene array data demonstrated primarily an enhancement of genes related to apoptosis. In particular, the apoptosis antigen 1 (APO-1), p21 and the G protein-coupled receptor 87 (G-87) were 2.6- to 3.3-fold upregulated as compared to the expression in untreated animals. There was a 100% separation of untreated and treated animals on the basis of these three genes. The SUV and the FDG kinetic parameters obtained by compartmental and noncompartmental fitting were not significantly different when individual parameters were compared between groups. However, classification analysis of the combination of the PET parameters VB, K1, k3, and influx revealed an overall accuracy of 84%. We were able to identify 91.7% (11/12) of the treated animals and 76.9% (10/13) of the untreated animals correctly using the classification analysis of PET data.

Conclusion: Even one chemotherapeutic treatment using FOLFOX has an impact on gene expression and significantly modulates FDG kinetics. Quantitative assessment of the tracer kinetics and the application of classification analysis to the data are promising tools to identify those tumours that demonstrate a chemotherapeutic effect very early following treatment.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19280186/
Estimation of input functions from dynamic [18F]FLT PET studies of the head and neck with correction for partial volume effects,"Sara L Hackett, Dan Liu, Anastasia Chalkidou, Paul Marsden, David Landau, John D Fenwick","Background: We present a method for extracting arterial input functions from dynamic [18F]FLT PET images of the head and neck, directly accounting for the partial volume effect. The method uses two blood samples, for which the optimum collection times are assessed.

Methods: Six datasets comprising dynamic PET images, co-registered computed tomography (CT) scans and blood-sampled input functions were collected from four patients with head and neck tumours. In each PET image set, a region was identified that comprised the carotid artery (outlined on CT images) and surrounding tissue within the voxels containing the artery. The time course of activity in the region was modelled as the sum of the blood-sampled input function and a compartmental model of tracer uptake in the surrounding tissue.The time course of arterial activity was described by a mathematical function with seven parameters. The parameters of the function and the compartmental model were simultaneously estimated, aiming to achieve the best match between the modelled and imaged time course of regional activity and the best match of the estimated blood activity to between 0 and 3 samples. The normalised root-mean-square (RMSnorm) differences and errors in areas under the curves (AUCs) between the measured and estimated input functions were assessed.

Results: A one-compartment model of tracer movement to and from the artery best described uptake in the tissue surrounding the artery, so the final model of the input function and tissue kinetics has nine parameters to be estimated. The estimated and blood-sampled input functions agreed well when two blood samples, obtained at times between 2 and 8 min and between 8 and 60 min, were used in the estimation process (RMSnorm values of 1.1 ± 0.5 and AUC errors for the peak and tail region of the curves of 15% ± 9% and 10% ± 8%, respectively). A third blood sample did not significantly improve the accuracy of the estimated input functions.

Conclusions: Input functions for FLT-PET studies of the head and neck can be estimated well using a one-compartment model of tracer movement and TWO blood samples obtained after the peak in arterial activity.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24369816/
Transport of volatile compounds in porous media in the presence of a trapped gas phase,"O A Cirpka, P K Kitanidis","The presence of an immobile gaseous phase in an otherwise-saturated porous medium affects the transport of volatile compounds. The linear theory of partitioning tracers suggests that a volatile tracer introduced into such a system should be retarded with a constant retardation factor. Using high concentrations, however, the saturation of the gaseous phase will change as an effect of the tracer test itself. Competitive gas transfer among all volatile compounds and the change of saturation may lead to tracer concentrations that are temporarily higher than those injected. We analyze the system in the framework of the coherence theory by Helfferich [Soc. Pet. Eng. J. 21 (1) (1981) 51]. The governing equations are formulated as functions of total concentration, i.e., the mass of solutes in all phases per pore volume. Neglecting dispersion and mass-transfer kinetics, we derive the characteristic form of the resulting system of hyperbolic equations. In a system with N volatile compounds, a variation of the concentrations splits up into N waves, each traveling with its own characteristic velocity. If the presence of a gaseous phase is sustained, one wave will be a standing one. We perform numerical model calculations for tracers with various Henry's law coefficients and show that the results agree with the semi-analytical solution obtained by coherence theory.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11411400/
Mechanistic positron emission tomography studies: demonstration of a deuterium isotope effect in the monoamine oxidase-catalyzed binding of [11C]L-deprenyl in living baboon brain,"J S Fowler, A P Wolf, R R MacGregor, S L Dewey, J Logan, D J Schlyer, B Langstrom","The application of positron emission tomography (PET) to the study of biochemical transformations in the living human and animal body requires the development of highly selective radiotracers whose concentrations in tissue provide a record of a discrete metabolic process. L-N-[11C-methyl]Deprenyl ([11C]L-deprenyl), a suicide inactivator of monoamine oxidase (MAO) type B, has been developed as a radiotracer for mapping MAO B in the living human and animal brain. In this investigation, [11C]L-deprenyl (1) and [11C]L-deprenyl-alpha, alpha-2H2 (2) have been compared in three different baboons by PET measurement of carbon-11 uptake and retention in the brain and the measurement of the amount of unchanged tracer in the arterial plasma over a 90-min time interval. For one baboon, N-[11C-methyl-2H3]L-deprenyl (3) was also studied. Kinetic parameters calculated using a three-compartment model revealed a deuterium isotope effect of 3.8 +/- 1.1. Comparison of the two tracers (1 and 2) in mouse brain demonstrated that deuterium substitution significantly reduced the amount of radioactivity bound to protein. HPLC and GLC analysis of the soluble radioactivity in mouse brain after injection of [11C]L-deprenyl showed the presence of [11C]methamphetamine as a major product along with unidentified labeled products. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide electrophoresis with carbon-14-labeled L-deprenyl showed that a protein of molecular weight 58,000 was labeled. These results establish that MAO-catalyzed cleavage of the alpha carbon-hydrogen bond on the propargyl group is the rate limiting (or a major rate contributing) step in the retention of carbon-11 in brain and that the in vivo detection of labeled products in brain after the injection of [11C]L-deprenyl provides a record of MAO activity.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3139834/
[Evaluation of partial volume effect in quantitative measurement of regional cerebral blood flow using positron emission tomography],"Y Narita, H Iida, B A Ardekani, J Hatazawa, I Kanno, T Nakamura, K Uemura","Effects of limited spatial resolution of the positron emission tomography (PET) scanner on the quantitative measurement of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was investigated for various tracer kinetic models with use of 15O labeled water and PET. Using a numerical brain phantom consisting of a gray matter, white matter and cerebrospinal fluid components, dynamical tracer distribution images were calculated for the H215O bolus injection and for the C15O2 gas inhalation protocols. The tracer distribution images were convoluted with a 2 dimensional gaussian function with full-width at half maximum (FWHM) of 4, 7, 12 mm to simulate a limited spatial resolution of the PET scanner, and rCBF images were calculated according to some kinetic models. Smoothing the tracer distribution images caused a heterogeneous structure (tissue mixture) in a given volume element. rCBF values calculated by models with use of 15O-water and PET were found to provide rCBF values that were systematically underestimated compared with those obtained by the microsphere model for a mixed tissue region. Moreover, the magnitude of the underestimation was shown to be highly dependent on the tracer kinetic models employed, those errors for mixed tissue of gray and white matter were 20% on steady state, 9% on autoradiography and on weighted integration method, and 2% on non-linear least squares fitting, compared with microsphere model. More errors observed by steady state method and autoradiography method happened for tissue mixture consisting gray matter, white matter and cerebrospinal fluid components. It is important to take into account for difference of the partial volume effect for each models in calculated rCBF.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7715102/
Characterisation of [¹¹C]PR04.MZ in Papio anubis baboon: a selective high-affinity radioligand for quantitative imaging of the dopamine transporter,"Patrick J Riss, Jacob M Hooker, Colleen Shea, Youwen Xu, Pauline Carter, Donald Warner, Valentina Ferrari, Sung-Won Kim, Franklin I Aigbirhio, Joanna S Fowler, Frank Roesch","N-(4-fluorobut-2-yn-1-yl)-2β-carbomethoxy-3β-(4'-tolyl)nortropane (PR04.MZ, 1) is a PET radioligand for the non-invasive exploration of the function of the cerebral dopamine transporter (DAT). A reliable automated process for routine production of the carbon-11 labelled analogue [(11)C]PR04.MZ ([(11)C]-1) has been developed using GMP compliant equipment. An adult female Papio anubis baboon was studied using a test-retest protocol with [(11)C]-1 in order to assess test-retest reliability, metabolism and CNS distribution profile of the tracer in non-human primates. Blood sampling was performed throughout the studies for determination of the free fraction in plasma (f(P)), plasma input functions and metabolic degradation of the radiotracer [(11)C]-1. Time-activity curves were derived for the putamen, the caudate nucleus, the ventral striatum, the midbrain and the cerebellum. Distribution volumes (V(T)) and non-displaceable binding potentials (BP(ND)) for various brain regions and the blood were obtained from kinetic modelling. [(11)C]-1 shows promising results as a selective marker of the presynaptic dopamine transporter.

Kinetic modelling using basis functions derived from two-tissue compartmental models with a plasma input function: general principle and application to [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography,"Young T Hong, Tim D Fryer","A kinetic modelling method for the determination of influx constant, Ki is given that utilises basis functions derived from plasma input two-tissue compartmental models (BAFPIC). Two forms of the basis functions are given: BAFPICI with k4=0 (no product loss) and BAFPICR with k4 non-zero. Simulations were performed using literature rate constant values for [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) in both normal and abnormal brain pathology. Both homogeneous and heterogeneous tissues were simulated and this data was also used as input for other methods commonly used to determine Ki: non-linear least squares compartmental modelling (NLLS), autoradiographic method and Patlak-Gjedde graphical analysis (PGA). The four methods were also compared for real FDG positron emission tomography (PET) data. For both k4=0 and k4 non-zero simulated data BAFPIC had the best bias properties of the four methods. The autoradiographic method was always the best for variability but BAFPICI had lower variability than PGA and NLLS. For non-zero k4 data, the variance of BAFPICR was inferior to PGA but still significantly superior to NLLS. Ki maps calculated from real data substantiate the simulation results, with BAFPICI having lower noise than PGA. Voxel Ki values from BAFPICI correlated well with those from PGA (r2=0.989). BAFPIC is easy to implement and combines low bias with good noise properties for voxel-wise determination of Ki for FDG. BAFPIC is suitable for determining Ki for other tracers well characterised by a serial two-tissue compartment model and has the advantage of also producing values for individual kinetic constants and blood volume.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20156574/
6-[18F]fluoro-L-dopa uptake and [76Br]bromolisuride binding in the excitotoxically lesioned caudate-putamen of nonhuman primates studied using positron emission tomography,"P Hantraye, C Loc'H, B Maziere, M Khalili-Varasteh, C Crouzel, D Fournier, J C Yorke, O Stulzaft, D Riche, O Isacson","The functional status of the dopaminergic system following striatal excitotoxic lesions was studied in living baboons by positron emission tomography (PET) using 6-[18F]fluoro-L-dopa as specific tracer for the presynaptic dopaminergic terminals and [76Br]bromolisuride as selective dopamine D2-receptor marker. The glutamate receptor agonist ibotenic acid (IA) was injected into the right caudate-putamen of six baboons to induce a neuropathological and behavioral model of Huntington's disease (HD). In vivo PET studies performed 3 to 6 months after the IA injections showed that subtotal excitotoxic lesions of the CP were accompanied by changes in the kinetic of [76Br]bromolisuride binding indicating a dose-dependent reduction in binding sites in the lesioned striatum of all IA-injected animals. In the most severely lesioned animals, there was also a decrease in the uptake of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic marker. The loss of D2-receptors and decrease in striatal dopamine uptake are consistent with clinical and postmortem findings in HD. In addition, the decrease in 6-[18F]fluoro-L-dopa uptake confirms previous studies performed in a rat model of HD suggesting a continuous decline of nigral dopamine cell function following destruction of their intrinsic striatal target neurons. The results of our experience to date in PET studies of 6-[18F]fluoro-L-dopa and [76Br]bromolisuride binding in IA-lesioned primates indicate that PET can identify effects of cell loss on markers of pre- and postsynaptic function in the striatum of living subjects.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1531196/
Is the physical decay correction of the (18)F-FDG input function in dynamic PET imaging justified?,"Eric Laffon, Olivier Barret, Roger Marthan, Dominique Ducassou","In this theoretic note, the rationale for the physical decay correction of the (18)F-FDG input function in dynamic PET is investigated, using the Patlak equation as an example.

Methods: The Patlak equation conventionally obtained when correcting the (18)F-FDG input function and correcting the tissue activity measurement for (18)F physical decay can also be derived from a 2-compartment analysis that does not conceptually involve any physical decay correction of the (18)F-FDG input function but accounts only for the physical decay of the trapped tracer.

Results: We demonstrate that exactly the same equation can be derived from the 2 conceptual approaches, and hence each approach yields the correct uptake rate of the tracer.

Conclusion: No advantage in (18)F-FDG dynamic PET can be expected from using the concept of uncorrected data rather than that of decay-corrected data. Nevertheless, conceptually, we show that correcting the (18)F-FDG input function for radioactive decay cannot be justified and that this correction is not compatible with the calculation of patient radiation dose.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19447853/
Evaluating pulmonary vascular permeability with radiolabeled proteins: an error analysis,"M A Mintun, T E Warfel, D P Schuster","Using techniques of mathematical simulation, we compared two methods of evaluating pulmonary vascular permeability, i.e., transvascular protein flux. Both methods calculate a transport rate constant [pulmonary transcapillary escape rate (PTCER)] after making external radiation detection measurements of an intravenously administered radiolabeled protein. With one method, lung tissue time-activity data are acquired by positron emission tomography (PET) and are interpreted with a two-compartment model. With the other method, the time-activity data are acquired with simple detector probes and are interpreted by linear regression after normalizing for various physical factors (slope-intercept or SI method). The results show that significant errors in calculating PTCER can result from using the SI method, because it ignores the effects of back-flux on the tissue time-activity measurements. Both methods produce errors if the data analysis includes activity from vascular volumes not involved in tracer exchange with the extravascular compartment. Significant errors can also occur with the PET method, particularly when permeability is nearly normal, if pulmonary vascular volume changes significantly during the period of data collection. On balance, the PET method appears to be the method of choice for accurately evaluating pulmonary vascular permeability by protein flux measurements, although both methods may be useful in clinical applications.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2347807/
Computed tomography assessment of cerebral perfusion using a distributed parameter tracer kinetics model: validation with H(2)((15))O positron emission tomography measurements and initial clinical experience in patients with acute stroke,"Sotirios Bisdas, Frank Donnerstag, Georg Berding, Thomas J Vogl, Choon Hua Thng, Tong San Koh","We describe a distributed parameter (DP) model for tracer kinetic analysis in brain and validate the derived perfusion values with positron emission tomography (PET) scans. The proposed model is applied on actual clinical cases of hemispheric stroke. Nine patients with experienced transient ischaemic attack or minor stroke and a stenosis of the internal carotid artery were referred for computed tomography (CT) and PET imaging. The applicability of the DP model in clinical practice was tested in seven patients with acute stroke who received a baseline perfusion CT study and a noncontrast follow-up CT study after 2.4+/-1.8 days. The mean blood flow (F) value for all patients with carotid stenosis in the pooled data (54 regions of interest (ROIs)) was 37.9+/-11.2 mL/min per 100 g in perfusion CT and 35.6+/-9.8 mL/min per 100 g in perfusion PET imaging [r=0.77 (P=0.00)]. Regression analysis of the pooled ROIs for every patient revealed significant correlation between F values in seven patients [r=0.50 to 0.79 (r(2)-values ranged from 0.45 to 0.79), (0.01 < or = P < or = 0.05)]. Parametric maps that corresponded to all physiologic parameters were generated for every perfusion CT in the patients with acute stroke using the DP model. The ischaemic area was better delineated in F, intravascular blood volume and lag time (t(lag)) maps. The correlation coefficient comparing the visually outlined regions of abnormality between the t(lag) parametric map and the follow-up CT scans was 0.81 (P=0.003). In conclusion, DP physiological model using more realistic pharmacokinetics is feasible in dynamic contrast-enhanced CT of the brain in patients with acute and chronic cerebrovascular disease.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17593946/

Further evaluation of quantum chemical methods for the prediction of non-specific binding of positron emission tomography tracers,"Callum J Dickson, Antony D Gee, Idriss Bennacef, Ian R Gould, Lula Rosso","The non-specific binding of candidate positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracers causes resulting PET images to have poor contrast and is a key determinant for the success or failure of imaging drugs. Non-specific binding is thought to arise when radiotracers bind to cell membranes and moieties other than their intended target. Our previous preliminary work has proposed the use of the drug-lipid interaction energy descriptor to predict the level of non-specific binding in vivo using a limited set of ten well known PET radiotracers with kinetic modelling data taken from the literature. This work validates and extends the use of the drug-lipid interaction energy descriptor using a new set of twenty-two candidate PET radiotracers with non-specific binding data recently collected at the same imaging centre with consistent methodology. As with the previous set of radiotracers, a significant correlation is found between the quantum chemical drug-lipid interaction energy and in vivo non-specific binding experimental values. In an effort to speed up the calculation process, several semi-empirical quantum chemical methods were assessed for their ability to reproduce the ab initio results. However no single semi-empirical method was found to consistently reproduce the level of correlation achieved with ab initio quantum chemical methods.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22052158/
Estimation of local cerebral glucose utilization by positron emission tomography: comparison of [18F]2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose and [18F]2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-mannose in patients with focal brain lesions,"K Wienhard, G Pawlik, B Nebeling, J Rudolf, G Fink, K Hamacher, G Stöcklin, W D Heiss","A comparative PET study of [18F]2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) and [18F]2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-mannose (FDM) uptake was performed in 13 patients with focal brain lesions. Differences between FDG and FDM with respect to model rate constants, lumped constant, and estimated metabolic rate for glucose were determined on a regional basis. Across whole brain, the transport rate constant K1* was almost unchanged, whereas k2*, describing the transport back from tissue to plasma, was 6% higher, and the phosphorylation rate constant k3* was 9% lower for FDM compared to FDG. This implies a 20% lower lumped constant for FDM. No significant regional variability of this differential tracer behavior was observed in normal or in lesioned brain tissue. Thus, results from previous FDG studies, where the radiotracer was not 100% pure FDG but contained varying amounts of FDM, can easily be corrected by adjustment of the lumped constant employed in metabolic quantitation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2016357/

The authors have formulated four mathematical models that describe the dynamic behavior of a freely diffusible tracer (H215O) in a region of interest (ROI) incorporating estimates of regional tissue flow that are independent of PVE. The current study was intended to evaluate the feasibility of these models and to establish a methodology to accurately quantify regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) corrected for PVE in cortical gray matter regions. Five monkeys were studied with PET after IV H2(15)O two times (n = 3) or three times (n = 2) in a row. Two ROIs were drawn on structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans and projected onto the PET images in which regional CBF values and the water perfusable tissue fraction for the cortical gray matter tissue (hence the volume of gray matter) were estimated. After the PET study, the animals were killed and stereologic analysis was performed to assess the gray matter mass in the corresponding ROIs. Reproducibility of the estimated parameters and sensitivity to various error sources were also evaluated. All models tested in the current study yielded PVE-corrected regional CBF values (approximately 0.8 mL x min(-1) x g(-1) for models with a term for gray matter tissue and 0.5 mL x min(-1) x g(-1) for models with a term for a mixture of gray matter and white matter tissues). These values were greater than those obtained from ROIs tracing the gray matter cortex using conventional H2(15)O autoradiography (approximately 0.40 mL x min(-1) x g(-1)). Among the four models, configurations that included two parallel tissue compartments demonstrated better results with regards to the agreement of tissue time-activity curve and the Akaike's Information Criteria. Error sensitivity analysis suggested the model that fits three parameters of the gray matter CBF, the gray matter fraction, and the white matter fraction with fixed white matter CBF as the most reliable and suitable for estimating the gray matter CBF. Reproducibility with this model was 11% for estimating the gray matter CBF. The volume of gray matter tissue can also be estimated using this model and was significantly correlated with the results from the stereologic analysis. However, values were significantly smaller compared with those measured by stereologic analysis by 40%, which can not be explained by the methodologic errors. In conclusion, the partial volume correction was essential in quantitation of regional CBF. The method presented in this article provided the PVE-corrected regional CBF in the cortical gray matter tissue. This study also suggests that further studies are required before using MRI derived anatomic information for PVE correction in PET.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10950386/
"Design, synthesis, radiolabeling, and in vitro and in vivo evaluation of bridgehead iodinated analogues of N-{2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)piperazin-1-yl]ethyl}-N-(pyridin-2-yl)cyclohexanecarboxamide (WAY-100635) as potential SPECT ligands for the 5-HT1A receptor","Rana Al Hussainy, Joost Verbeek, Dion van der Born, Anton H Braker, Josée E Leysen, Remco J Knol, Jan Booij, J Koos D M Herscheid","Here we describe the design, synthesis, and pharmacological profile of 5-HT(1A) receptor ligands related to 1 (WAY-100635). The cyclohexyl moiety in 1 and its O-desmethylated analogue 3 were replaced by the bridgehead iodinated bridge-fused rings: adamantyl, cubyl, bicyclo[2.2.2]octyl, or bicyclo[2.2.1]heptyl. All analogues displayed a (sub)nanomolar affinity for the 5-HT(1A) receptor in vitro. Compounds 6b and 7b appeared to be selective for this receptor over other relevant receptors and could easily be iodinated with radioactive iodine-123. In humane hepatocytes, [(123)I]6b showed a low propensity for amide hydrolysis and a stable carbon-iodine bond. The biodistribution of [(123)I]6b and [(123)I]7b in rats revealed that the carbon-iodine bond was also stable in vivo. Unfortunately, the brain uptake and the specificity for both radioligands were significantly lower than those of the parent molecule 1. In conclusion, the designed tracers are not suitable for SPECT imaging.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21520940/
Effects of shortened scanning intervals on calculated regional rates of cerebral protein synthesis determined with the L-[1-11C]leucine PET method,"Giampaolo Tomasi, Mattia Veronese, Alessandra Bertoldo, Carolyn Beebe Smith, Kathleen C Schmidt","To examine effects of scan duration on estimates of regional rates of cerebral protein synthesis (rCPS), we reanalyzed data from thirty-nine previously reported L-[1-11C]leucine PET studies. Subjects consisted of 12 healthy volunteers studied twice, awake and under propofol sedation, and 15 subjects with fragile X syndrome (FXS) studied once under propofol sedation. All scans were acquired on a high resolution scanner. We used a basis function method for voxelwise estimation of parameters of the kinetic model of L-[1-11C]leucine and rCPS over the interval beginning at the time of tracer injection and ending 30, 45, 60, 75 or 90 min later. For each study and scan interval, regional estimates in nine regions and whole brain were obtained by averaging voxelwise estimates over all voxels in the region. In all three groups rCPS was only slightly affected by scan interval length and was very stable between 60 and 90 min. Furthermore, statistical comparisons of rCPS between awake and sedated healthy volunteers provided almost identical results when they were based on 60 min scan data as when they were based on data from the full 90 min interval. Statistical comparisons between sedated healthy volunteers and sedated subjects with FXS also yielded almost identical results when based on 60 and 90 min scan intervals. We conclude that, under the conditions of our studies, scan duration can be shortened to 60 min without loss of precision.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29659612/
A strategy for removing the bias in the graphical analysis method,"J Logan, J S Fowler, N D Volkow, Y S Ding, G J Wang, D L Alexoff","The graphical analysis method, which transforms multiple time measurements of plasma and tissue uptake data into a linear plot, is a useful tool for rapidly obtaining information about the binding of radioligands used in PET studies. The strength of the method is that it does not require a particular model structure. However, a bias is introduced in the case of noisy data resulting in the underestimation of the distribution volume (DV), the slope obtained from the graphical method. To remove the bias, a modification of the method developed by Feng et al. (1993), the generalized linear least squares (GLLS) method, which provides unbiased estimates for compartment models was used. The one compartment GLLS method has a relatively simple form, which was used to estimate the DV directly and as a smoothing technique for more general classes of model structures. In the latter case, the GLLS method was applied to the data in two parts, that is, one set of parameters was determined for times 0 to T1 and a second set from T1 to the end time. The curve generated from these two sets of parameters then was used as input to the graphical method. This has been tested using simulations of data similar to that of the PET ligand [11C]-d-threo-methylphenidate (MP, DV = 35 mL/mL) and 11C raclopride (RAC, DV = 1.92 mL/mL) and compared with two examples from image data with the same tracers. The noise model was based on counting statistics through the half-life of the isotope and the scanning time. Five hundred data sets at each noise level were analyzed. Results (DV) for the graphical analysis (DV(G)), the nonlinear least squares (NLS) method (DV(NLS)), the one-tissue compartment GLLS method (DV(F)), and the two part GLLS followed by graphical analysis (DV(FG)) were compared. DV(FG) was found to increase somewhat with increasing noise and in some data sets at high noise levels no estimate could be obtained. However, at intermediate levels it provided a good estimation of the true DV. This method was extended to use a reference tissue in place of the input function to generate the distribution volume ratio (DVR) to the reference region. A linearized form of the simplified reference tissue method of Lammertsma and Hume (1996) was used. The DVR generated directly from the model (DVR(FL)) was compared with DVR(FG) (determined from a ""smoothed"" uptake curve as for DV(FG)) using the graphical method.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11295885/
Modeling [18 F]MPPF positron emission tomography kinetics for the determination of 5-hydroxytryptamine(1A) receptor concentration with multiinjection,"Nicolas Costes, Isabelle Merlet, Luc Zimmer, Franck Lavenne, Luc Cinotti, Jacques Delforge, André Luxen, Jean-François Pujol, Didier Le Bars","The selectivity of [18F]MPPF (fluorine-18-labeled 4-(2;-methoxyphenyl)-1-[2;-(N-2""-pirydynyl)-p-fluorobenzamido]ethylpiperazine) for serotonergic 5-hydroxytryptamine(1A) (5-HT1A) receptors has been established in animals and humans. The authors quantified the parameters of ligand-receptor exchanges using a double-injection protocol. After injection of a tracer and a coinjection dose of [18F]MPPF, dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) data were acquired during a 160-minute session in five healthy males. These PET and magnetic resonance imaging data were coregistered for anatomical identification. A three-compartment model was used to determine six parameters: Fv (vascular fraction), K1, k2 (plasma/free compartment exchange rate), koff, kon/Vr (association and dissociation rate), Bmax (receptor concentration), and to deduce Kd (apparent equilibrium dissociation rate). The model was fitted with regional PET kinetics and arterial input function corrected for metabolites. Analytical distribution volume and binding potential were compared with indices generated by Logan-Patlak graphical analysis. The 5HT1A specificity for MPPF was evidenced. A Bmax of 2.9 pmol/mL and a Kd of 2.8 nmol/L were found in hippocampal regions, Kd and distribution volume in the free compartment were regionally stable, and the Logan binding potential was linearly correlated to Bmax. This study confirms the value of MPPF in the investigation of normal and pathologic systems involving the limbic network and 5-HT1A receptors. Standard values can be used for the simulation of simplified protocols.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12045674/
Labeling of histamine H1-receptors in vivo: a compartment model analysis and positron emission tomographic imaging,"K Yanai, T Watanabe, M Itoh, J Hatazawa, R Iwata, T Ido","Binding of [3H]-pyrilamine to guinea-pig brain in vivo was studied and analyzed kinetically on the basis of a four-compartment model to establish the method of analysis for the in vivo binding. The pharmacological properties of the [3H]-pyrilamine binding in vivo were similar to those of the in vitro binding to brain homogenate. The distribution of histamine H1-receptors in dog brain, which was obtained by positron emission tomography (PET) with [11C]-pyrilamine or doxepin as a tracer, was in good correlation to that obtained by the in vitro binding method.

Graphical analysis of PET data applied to reversible and irreversible tracers,J Logan,"The differential equations of compartmental analysis form the basis of the models describing the uptake of tracers used in imaging studies. Graphical analyses convert the model equations into linear plots, the slopes of which represent measures of tracer binding. The graphical methods are not dependent upon a particular model structure but the slopes can be related to combinations of the model parameters if a model structure is assumed. The input required is uptake data from a region of interest vs time and an input function that can either be plasma measurements or uptake data from a suitable reference region. Graphical methods can be applied to both reversible and irreversibly binding tracers. They provide considerable ease of computation compared to the optimization of individual model parameters in the solution of the differential equations generally used to describe the binding of tracers. Conditions under which the graphical techniques are applicable and some problems encountered in separating tracer delivery and binding are considered. Also the effect of noise can introduce a bias in the distribution volume which is the slope of the graphical analysis of reversible tracers. Smoothing techniques may minimize this problem and retain the model independence. In any case graphical techniques can provide insight into the binding kinetics of tracers in a visual way.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11091109/
Change in binding potential as a quantitative index of neurotransmitter release is highly sensitive to relative timing and kinetics of the tracer and the endogenous ligand,"Karmen K Yoder, Chunzhi Wang, Evan D Morris","Change in binding potential (deltaBP) is often used to indicate alterations in neurotransmitter concentration in response to stimuli. Increasingly, it is being used in bolus studies as a quantitative index of dopamine (DA) release. In bolus studies, however, BP is an average quantity over time that is influenced by the dynamics of both the tracer and the neurotransmitter. We sought to characterize the sensitivity of deltaBP to changes in endogenous DA concentration and to elucidate possible biases in deltaBP with respect to timing of task-induced or drug-induced increases in DA.

Methods: Noiseless simulations of (11)C-raclopride PET curves were performed in a specific binding region with concomitant increases in endogenous DA. DA changes were modeled as delta-functions, gamma-variates, or as realistic drug-induced increases in DA over time, based on published results. Graphical estimation of BP with a reference region as the input function was used, with a multilinear formulation of the operational equation.

Results: Simulations demonstrated that deltaBP (a). is linear over a narrow range of integrated DA release, (b). has an inherent sensitivity to timing of DA perturbations, and (c). could incorrectly infer the relative amounts of DA released between subject populations or experimental conditions. These results are explained by what we term the effective weighted availability, which describes the interaction of a DA function and free raclopride concentration over time and follows directly from earlier work.

Conclusion: We illustrate how, under quite plausible circumstances, deltaBP may lead to erroneous conclusions about relative amounts of DA released after dopaminergic perturbations. Our findings caution against using deltaBP as a quantitative or rank index of DA release when comparing different dopaminergic stimuli.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15136642/
A method for the in vivo investigation of the serotonergic 5-HT2 receptors in the human cerebral cortex using positron emission tomography and 18F-labeled setoperone,"J Blin, G Sette, M Fiorelli, O Bletry, J L Elghozi, C Crouzel, J C Baron","Following previous validation in baboons, we have studied the characteristics of [18F]setoperone as a radioligand for investigating serotonergic 5-hydroxytryptamine2 (5-HT2) receptors in the normal, unmedicated human brain with positron emission tomography (PET); subjects orally pretreated with therapeutic amounts of ketanserin, sulpiride, or prazosin were also studied to evaluate the specificity and sensitivity of [18F]setoperone brain specific binding. In controls (n = 10), the tracer showed a clear-cut retention in both frontal cortex and striatum (known to contain a high density of 5-HT2 receptors) relative to cerebellum (known to be devoid of 5-HT2 receptors). In the seven young controls (20-39 years old), the frontal cortex/cerebellum and striatum/cerebellum ratios increased during the first hour to reach similar values of 2.53 +/- 0.12 and 2.38 +/- 0.11 (mean +/- SEM), respectively, and were essentially stable during the second hour. Pretreatment with ketanserin (a 5-HT2 blocker) significantly reduced the frontal cortex/cerebellum ratio to 0.7-1.0 at 65 min, whereas the striatum/cerebellum ratio was significantly, but only partially, reduced. During sulpiride treatment (a D2 blocker), the frontal cortex/cerebellum ratio was not altered, whereas the striatum/cerebellum ratio was significantly, but only partially, reduced. With prazosin pretreatment (an alpha 1-adrenergic blocker), neither the frontal cortex/cerebellum nor the striatum/cerebellum ratio was modified. These data in humans with PET demonstrate that [18F]setoperone labels with high sensitivity and selectivity 5-HT2 receptors in the frontal cortex; in striata, however, binding is to both 5-HT2 and D2 receptors. The deproteinated-to-whole plasma radio-activity concentration ratio increased with time following injection. The mean percentage of intact [18F]setoperone, in deproteinated plasma, was 82, 74, 53, 45, 30, and 22% at 5, 10, 20, 30, 60, and 110 min following injection, respectively. These data indicate that [18F]setoperone (a) is significantly bound to plasma proteins and (b) is significantly metabolized into several labeled metabolites that are much more hydrophilic than setoperone and, hence, presumably do not cross the blood-brain barrier. These results suggest the suitability of [18F]setoperone data for modeling of 5-HT2 receptor binding in brain.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2182776/
Direct 4D parametric imaging for linearized models of reversibly binding PET tracers using generalized AB-EM reconstruction,"Arman Rahmim, Yun Zhou, Jing Tang, Lijun Lu, Vesna Sossi, Dean F Wong","Due to high noise levels in the voxel kinetics, development of reliable parametric imaging algorithms remains one of most active areas in dynamic brain PET imaging, which in the vast majority of cases involves receptor/transporter studies with reversibly binding tracers. As such, the focus of this work has been to develop a novel direct 4D parametric image reconstruction scheme for such tracers. Based on a relative equilibrium (RE) graphical analysis formulation (Zhou et al 2009b Neuroimage 44 661-70), we developed a closed-form 4D EM algorithm to directly reconstruct distribution volume (DV) parametric images within a plasma input model, as well as DV ratio (DVR) images within a reference tissue model scheme (wherein an initial reconstruction was used to estimate the reference tissue time-activity curves). A particular challenge with the direct 4D EM formulation is that the intercept parameters in graphical (linearized) analysis of reversible tracers (e.g. Logan or RE analysis) are commonly negative (unlike for irreversible tracers, e.g. using Patlak analysis). Subsequently, we focused our attention on the AB-EM algorithm, derived by Byrne (1998, Inverse Problems 14 1455-67) to allow inclusion of prior information about the lower (A) and upper (B) bounds for image values. We then generalized this algorithm to the 4D EM framework, thus allowing negative intercept parameters. Furthermore, our 4D AB-EM algorithm incorporated and emphasized the use of spatially varying lower bounds to achieve enhanced performance. As validation, the means of parameters estimated from 55 human (11)C-raclopride dynamic PET studies were used for extensive simulations using a mathematical brain phantom. Images were reconstructed using conventional indirect as well as proposed direct parametric imaging methods. Noise versus bias quantitative measurements were performed in various regions of the brain. Direct 4D EM reconstruction resulted in notable qualitative and quantitative accuracy improvements (over 35% noise reduction, with matched bias, in both plasma and reference-tissue input models). Similar improvements were also observed in the coefficient of variation of the estimated DV and DVR values even for relatively low uptake cortical regions, suggesting the enhanced ability for robust parameter estimation. The method was also tested on a 90 min (11)C-raclopride patient study performed on the high-resolution research tomograph wherein the proposed method was shown across a variety of regions to outperform the conventional method in the sense that for a given DVR value, improved noise levels were observed.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22252120/

MicroPET imaging in anesthetized cynomolgus monkeys with [(18)F]1-[(18)F]4 demonstrated that all four tracers behave similarly with peak uptake in the SERT-rich brain regions achieved after 45-55 min, followed by a steady washout. An awake monkey study was performed with [(18)F]1, which demonstrated that the uptake of [(18)F]1 was not influenced by anesthesia. Chase studies with the SERT ligand 15 displaced [(18)F]1-[(18)F]4, but chase studies with the DAT ligand 16 did not displace [(18)F]1-[(18)F]4 thus indicating that the tracers were binding specifically to the SERT.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19053782/
Spatial regularization applied to factor analysis of medical image sequences (FAMIS),"F Frouin, A De Cesare, Y Bouchareb, A Todd-Pokropek, A Herment","Dynamic image sequences allow physiological mechanisms to be monitored after the injection of a tracer. Factor analysis of medical image sequences (FAMIS) hence creates a synthesis of the information in one image sequence. It estimates a limited number of structures (factor images) assuming that the tracer kinetics (factors) are similar at each point inside the structure. A spatial regularization method for computing factor images (REG-FAMIS) is proposed to remove irregularities due to noise in the original data while preserving discontinuities between structures. REG-FAMIS has been applied to two sets of simulations: (a) dynamic data with Gaussian noise and (b) dynamic studies in emission tomography (PET or SPECT), which respect real tomographic acquisition parameters and noise characteristics. Optimal regularization parameters are estimated in order to minimize the distance between reference images and regularized factor images. Compared with conventional factor images, the root mean square error between regularized images and reference factor images is improved by 3 for the first set of simulations, and by about 1.5 for the second set of simulations. In all cases, regularized factor images are qualitatively and quantitatively improved.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10495122/
[Kinetics of glucose metabolism in central neurocytomas],"H Shioya, K Mineura, T Sasajima, M Kowada, H Iida, T Ogawa, J Hatazawa, K Uemura","To estimate proliferating activity of central neurocytoma, we measured kinetic rate constants and glucose metabolic rate (kinetic-rCMRGI) using dynamic positron emission tomography (PET), as well as autoradiographic rCMRG1 (arg-rCMRG1), in patients with histologically verified central neurocytoma. The subject included five patients, four males and one female, aged from 23 to 53 years with a mean age of 41 years old. All tumors were located in the lateral ventricle and two extended into the third ventricle through the forearm of Monro. Tumor lesion on the PET images was determined using CT or MRI, which was performed at levels equivalent to those for the PET scans. The kinetic rate constants of tracer transport from blood to brain (k1), reverse transport from brain to blood (k2), and phosphorylation (k3) were analyzed according to the three compartment 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) model. For quantitative analysis, regions of interest (ROI) on PET images were delineated on the tumor and the contralateral gray matter. Tumor k1 and k2 values were similar to or higher than those of the contralateral gray matter, suggesting high permeability due to lack of blood-brain barrier. Tumor k3 value, an indicator of hexokinase activity, and kinetic-rCMRG1 were exceedingly lower in three of five patients. These three patients have been free from tumor recurrence or regrowth, postoperatively. The other two patients, tumor kinetic-rCMRG1 was similar to or higher than that of the contralateral gray matter. One patient suffered from tumor regrowth shortly after resection, and the other has been followed up postoperatively. Thus, k3 and kinetic-rCMRG1 are indicative parameters of proliferative activity in central neurocytoma.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7577144/
Feasibility of assessing [(18)F]FDG lung metabolism with late dynamic PET imaging,"Eric Laffon, Henri de Clermont, Jean-Marc Vernejoux, Jacques Jougon, Roger Marthan","Purpose: The aim of this work was to non-invasively establish the feasibility of assessing 2-deoxy-2-[(18)F]fluoro-D-glucose ((18)F-FDG) lung metabolism with the use of a late dynamic positron emission tomograpy (PET) acquisition, i.e., beyond 2 h after injection.

Procedures: The present method has been probed in 11 patients without any respiratory disease, under fasting conditions, by assessing mean values of (18)F-FDG lung metabolism. A kinetic model analysis has been implemented on a simple calculation sheet. An arbitrary (population based) input function has been used in each individual, which was obtained from literature data.

Results: In the healthy lung, no (18)F-FDG release was found, and the mean values (±SD) of the (18)F-FDG uptake rate constant and of the fraction of the free tracer in blood and interstitial volume were: K = 0.0016 min(-1) (±0.0005), and F = 0.18 (±0.10), respectively. These results were in very close agreement with literature data that were obtained by both three-compartment model analysis and Patlak graphical analysis (gold standards), and that used an invasive blood sampling. Furthermore, K and the standard uptake value index have been compared.

Conclusion: We conclude that assessing lung metabolism of (18)F-FDG in humans with the use of late dynamic PET imaging is feasible. The arbitrary input function of this non-invasive feasibility study could be replaced in further experiments by an input function obtained by arterial sampling. It is suggested that this method may prove useful to quantify (18)F-FDG lung metabolism under pathological conditions.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20524071/
[Hemocirculation and metabolism in intraventricular tumors: kinetic analysis of glucose metabolism],"H Shioya, K Mineura, M Kowada, H Iida, M Murakami, T Ogawa, J Hatazawa, K Uemura","To estimate hemocirculation and proliferating activity of intraventricular tumor, we measured kinetic rate constants (k1, k2, k3) and glucose metabolic rate (kinetic-rCMRGl) using dynamic positron emission tomography (PET), as well as regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), blood volume (rCBV), oxygen extraction fraction (rOEF), oxygen metabolic rate (rCMRO2) and autoradiographic rCMRGl (arg-rCMRGl), in patients with intraventricular tumor. The subjects included ten patients, five males and five females, aged from 13 to 53 years with a mean age of 32 years old. Eight tumors were located in the lateral ventricle and two extended into the third ventricle through the foramen of Monro. Another two tumors were located in the fourth ventricle. Histological diagnosis was as follows: five cases of central neurocytoma, one subependymal giant cell astrocytoma, one ependymoma, one choroid plexus carcinoma, one subependymoma, and one meningioma. Tumor lesion on the PET images was determined using CT or MRI, which was performed at levels equivalent to those for the PET scans. For quantitative analysis, regions of interest (ROI) on PET images were delineated on the tumor and the contralateral gray matter. Hemocirculation (rCBF, rCBV) of the tumor was similar to or higher than that of the contralateral gray matter, which corresponded to neuroradiological findings of abundant tumor vessels. Oxygen metabolic parameters (rOEF, rCMRO2) were significantly lower than those of the contralateral gray matter. Especially, low rOEF resulted in an excessive blood flow beyond oxygen demand of the tumor. The raised metabolic rate (rCMRO2/rCMRGl), as compared with that of meningiomas or malignant gliomas, suggested aerobic glycolysis. The kinetic rate constants of tracer transport from blood to brain (k1), reverse transport from brain to blood (k2), and phosphorylation (k3) were analyzed according to the three-compartment model of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18FDG). Tumor k1 and k2 values were similar to or higher than those of the contralateral gray matter, suggesting high permeability due to lack of blood-brain barrier and an abundant blood supply. Tumor k3 value, an indicator of hexokinase activity, and kinetic-rCMRGl were lower in six of eight patients. These six patients have been free from tumor recurrence or regrowth, postoperatively. In the other two patients, tumor kinetic-rCMRGl was similar to or higher than that of the contralateral gray matter, suggesting high activity of proliferation. However, one patient received irradiation and has been followed up, and the other received total resection and has shown no recurrence. Functional information concerning intraventricular tumor is obtained by PET analysis, and kinetic analysis of the rate constants is useful for interpreting a detailed metabolic process of glucose, and provides additional information on intraventricular tumor aggressiveness.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8851949/
Development and Evaluation of a Bayesian Optimization FDG Population-Based Input Function for Implementing Parametric Imaging in the Clinical Practice,"Alessia Artesani, Lorenzo Leonardi, Jelena Jandric, Lorenzo Muraglia, Charalampos Tsoumpas, Marcello Rodari, Laura Evangelista","Parametric imaging from dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) has gained interest for tumour diagnostics and treatment response evaluation. However, the lack of a standardized method for generating the input function ‒ reference curve for kinetic modelling ‒ has led to inconsistent descriptors, contributing to uncertainties in parametric imaging reliability. This study aims to address this challenge by proposing a hyperparametric optimization method for deriving FDG population-based input function (PBIF), independent of acquisition and injection protocols.&#xD;Method. This study included ten patients undergoing FDG PET scans using a standard axial field of view scanner. Image-derived input functions (IDIF) were extracted from the descending aorta, normalized, and utilized as input for PBIF modelling. Bayesian hyperparameter optimization was employed to estimate global optima for ten parameters that describe the input function through independent runs of up to 600 iterations each. The injection profile was integrated as a double rectangular profile, representing both the tracer injection and the saline flush tracer residual. &#xD;Results. The Bayesian optimization successfully modelled patient-specific IDIFs (R²=0.97). The algorithm estimated injection and flush durations in agreement with recorded values. Parameter distributions showed low variability, with median amplitude and time constant values varying by around 15%. The glucose-affine molecule dynamics were characterized by distinct time constants of 6 seconds, 4 minutes, and 70 minutes. Analytical and numerical comparisons of parametric imaging from IDIF and PBIF show that Patlak analysis is unaffected by the injection characteristics.&#xD;Conclusion. The study highlights the benefits of Bayesian optimization for modelling PBIF without prior knowledge of injection characteristics. These findings support the existence of unified FDG PBIF, facilitating the utilization of parametric imaging across PET centres. Although the present study is based on a limited, single-centre cohort, this methodological development is intended as a foundational study to further multi-centre validation on larger population.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40354791/
Positron emission tomography (PET) in the study of dopamine receptors in the primate brain: evaluation of a kinetic model using 11C-N-methyl-spiperone,"S A Eckernäs, S M Aquilonius, P Hartvig, J Hägglund, H Lundqvist, K Någren, B Långström",The regional kinetics of 11C-N-methyl-spiperone (11C-NMSP) are described in the monkey brain under tracer conditions and after displacement and protection experiments.

Special emphasis was placed on the evaluation of different mathematical approximations of a general compartment model. Different mathematical procedures are described and the results indicate that the approximations performed are reasonable. The simplest method for obtaining a reliable measurement of the rate constant k3 (which is approximately equal to proportional to the number of receptors) and k4 (the receptor dissociation rate constant) uses the radioactivity in the cerebellum as a measure of the tissue concentration of ligand equilibrating with the receptor compartment.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3495092/

Estimation of radioligand kinetics, including saturation of receptor binding was performed by use of non-linear mixed effects modelling. Data from the regions with the highest (ventral striatum) and lowest (cerebellum) radioligand concentrations were included in the analysis. It was assumed that the extent of non-displaceable brain uptake was the same in both regions while the rate of CNS uptake and the receptor density differed. The results of the analysis showed that AZD9272 binding at the receptor is saturable with an estimated plasma concentration corresponding to 50% occupancy of approximately 200 nM. The density of the receptor binding sites was estimated to 800 nM and 200 nM in ventral striatum and cerebellum respectively. By simultaneously analysing data from several PET measurements and different brain regions in a non-linear mixed effects framework it was possible to estimate parameters of interest that would otherwise be difficult to quantify.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22425672/
Effects of tracer blood measurement noise on glucose metabolic rate estimation,"D Feng, X Wang, R Fulton, B Hutton, J Morris","Tracer kinetic modeling with Positron Emission Tomography (PET) requires measurements of the time-activity curves in both plasma (PTAC) and tissue (TTAC) to estimate physiological parameters. However, the estimation usually ignores the measurement noise in plasma tracer activity curves. The accuracy and reliability of the physiological parameters estimated by ignoring such noise are not well understood. In this paper, computer simulations were performed to investigate the influence of input measurement noise on the accuracy of estimates. The results show that input measurement noise causes considerable variability in the parameter estimates.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2065176/
A rapid vesicle electrokinetic chromatography method for the in vitro prediction of non-specific binding for potential PET ligands,"Zhengjin Jiang, John Reilly, Brian Everatt, Emmanuelle Briard","High non-specific binding (NSB) is one of the most common reasons for candidate failure in potential positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer development. It is of interest to develop high throughput in vitro methods for predicting non-specific binding prior to radiolabeling, which would help guide radiotracer candidate selection and assist decision making in new radiotracer discovery. We evaluated several electrokinetic chromatographic (EKC) systems to help identify PET ligands with low non-specific binding characteristics by mimicking the ligand-brain tissue interaction. The measured retention factors of tracers in clinical use or terminated candidates within AOT vesicle EKC systems were compared with literature in vitro or in vivo NSB data. We conclude that there is a statistical correlation between the chromatographic retention parameters of tested drugs and their NSB. The AOT vesicle EKC method can provide NSB in vitro trend analysis for a large number of drug candidates early in the novel radiotracer discovery process with minimal resources.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21126842/
Quantitative PET studies in pretreated melanoma patients: a comparison of 6-[18F]fluoro-L-dopa with 18F-FDG and (15)O-water using compartment and noncompartment analysis,"A Dimitrakopoulou-Strauss, L G Strauss, C Burger","The purpose of the study was to evaluate the 6-[18F]fluoro-L-dopa (FDOPA) kinetics with PET in patients with treated melanoma metastases and to compare it with the standard tracer 18F-FDG as well as with the perfusion tracer (15)O-water in selected cases.

Methods: The study included 11 patients (22 lesions) with pretreated metastatic melanomas. Dynamic studies with FDG and in selected cases with (15)O-water (eight patients) preceded the FDOPA study. A one-tissue-compartment model was used for the evaluation of the FDOPA and (15)O-water studies, and a two-tissue-compartment model and Patlak analysis were used for the FDG data. A noncompartment model based on chaos theory was used for calculating fractal dimension, which is a parameter for heterogeneity.

Results: The FDG studies showed a 1.5-fold increased uptake in comparison with surrounding tissue in 19 of 22 metastatic lesions (sensitivity of 86.4%). False-negative FDG results were obtained in 2 patients (three lesions). FDOPA uptake was enhanced in 14 of 22 metastatic lesions (sensitivity of 64%). FDG uptake was 1.5-fold higher than FDOPA uptake in 18 of 22 metastases from melanoma, whereas FDOPA uptake was 1.5-fold higher than FDG uptake in 2 patients with liver metastases. The data did not show a statistically significant correlation between the transport constant (K1) for FDOPA and that for FDG or between the standardized uptake value for FDOPA and FDG in metastases. No statistically significant correlation was found between K1 for FDOPA and that for (15)O-water. The data show that FDOPA uptake is not perfusion dependent and provides different information from FDG. The fractal dimension was similar for all tracers within the tumor region. Detectability of metastases was enhanced when both tracers were used (sensitivity of 95%).

Conclusion: In patients with negative FDG findings, FDOPA can help to identify viable melanoma metastases and thus may help to select patients who would benefit from further treatment.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11216523/
Estimation of myocardial glucose utilisation with PET using the left ventricular time-activity curve as a non-invasive input function,"X Li, D Feng, K P Lin, S C Huang","The validation study is described of a new modelling method that has been developed, using tracer kinetic modelling with positron emission tomography (PET) to achieve non-invasive measurement of myocardial metabolic rate of glucose (MMRGlc). Eight data sets obtained from dynamic cardiac PET 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) studies on human subjects are employed, and the estimation of MMRGlc using both the new and traditional methods is compared. The results from all eight human FDG studies are consistent with those from previous computer simulations. With the new method, the estimated mean of K (a parameter directly proportional to MMRGlc) increases by about 8%, and that of k 4 (the rate constant of FDG dephosphorylation) decreases by about 48%. The approach should be more suitable for use in dynamic cardiac PET studies when non-invasive means are used to obtain the plasma time-activity curve from left-ventricle PET images.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9614758/
The diabetic heart: a porcine model evaluated with positron emission tomography using 1-11C-palmitate and 3-11C-pyruvate,"P Hartvig, A Waldenström, G Wikström, T Zielinski, H J Martinussen, J Carslsten, L M Voipio-Pulkki, H Lundqvist, P Bjurling, K Någren","The potential value of positron emission tomography (PET) in evaluating the myocardial energy metabolism was studied in two previously healthy mini-pigs before, during and after the induction of non-insulin dependent diabetes with alloxan. The distribution and kinetics of radioactivity derived from trace amounts of 11C-pyruvate and 1-11C-palmitate were followed in different sections of the myocardium. The early distribution of both tracers was similar even after the development of diabetes. The elimination of 11C-pyruvate derived radioactivity was slower in the diabetic heart. The rate of beta-oxidation was also decreased as suggested by the elimination curve of 11C-palmitate and the incorporation of 11C-palmitate into the triglyceride and phospholipid pool of the myocardium was increased in the diabetic animals. The results are consistent with previous observations using other techniques. Positron emission tomography offers the opportunity to characterize regional tissue metabolism quantitatively in vivo. This method may become a powerful tool in studying myocardial metabolism and the metabolic basis for the cardiac dysfunction in diabetes mellitus.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2630151/
Joint parametric reconstruction and motion correction framework for dynamic PET data,"Jieqing Jiao, Alexandre Bousse, Kris Thielemans, Pawel Markiewicz, Ninon Burgos, David Atkinson, Simon Arridge, Brian F Hutton, Sébastien Ourselin","In this paper we propose a novel algorithm for jointly performing data based motion correction and direct parametric reconstruction of dynamic PET data. We derive a closed form update for the penalised likelihood maximisation which greatly enhances the algorithm's computational efficiency for practical use. Our algorithm achieves sub-voxel motion correction residual with noisy data in the simulation-based validation and reduces the bias of the direct estimation of the kinetic parameter of interest. A preliminary evaluation on clinical brain data using [18F]Choline shows improved contrast for regions of high activity. The proposed method is based on a data-driven kinetic modelling method and is directly applicable to reversible and irreversible PET tracers, covering a range of clinical applications.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25333108/
View of the brain through a flow-coloured time window,E Ryding,Radioactive tracer substances administered to study cerebral functions open a time-dependent window to the brain. We can study e.g. regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) or chemical properties such as receptors for transmitter substances. Since the tracer substance is carried by the blood flow into the brain its initial distribution will be proportional to the rCBF. The possibility to study more specific brain functions depends on the available time for redistribution of the tracer substance according to its specific chemical affinity. I have studied with the aid of a simple mathematic model the time needed for distribution and redistribution of freely diffusable tracer substances in the brain. The results indicate that SPECT measurements of brain receptor properties in theory give at least as good recording conditions as corresponding PET studies. Clinical SPECT receptor studies will presumably soon contribute to our knowledge of the epileptic pathogenic mechanisms.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8209638/
Study of the binding interaction between fluorinated matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors and Human Serum Albumin,"Giuseppe Digilio, Tiziano Tuccinardi, Francesca Casalini, Claudio Cassino, David M Dias, Carlos F G C Geraldes, Valeria Catanzaro, Alessandro Maiocchi, Armando Rossello","Fluorinated, arylsulfone-based inhibitors of Matrix Metalloproteinases (MMP) have been used, in the [(18)F]-radiolabelled version, as radiotracers targeted to MMP-2/9 for Positron Emission Tomography (PET). Although they showed acceptable tumour uptake, specificity was rather low. To get further insights into the reason of low specificity, the binding interaction of these compounds with Human Serum Albumin (HSA) has been investigated. (19)F NMR spectroscopy showed that all compounds considered partition between multiple HSA binding sites, being characterized by either slow-exchange kinetics (with Ka in the order of 10(5) M(-1)) and fast-exchange kinetics (with Ka in the order of 10(4) M(-1)). For 2-(2-(4'-(2-fluoroethoxy)biphenyl-4-ylsulfonyl)phenyl)acetic acid (1a) and 2-(2-(4'-(2-fluoroacetamido)biphenyl-4-ylsulfonyl)phenyl)acetic acid (1c), these slow and fast-exchanging binding sites could be mapped to Sudlow's site I and II, respectively. It is shown that high affinity albumin binding constitutes a theoretical limitation for the specificity achievable by MMP-inhibitors as MMP-targeted PET tracers in cancer imaging, because albumin accumulating aspecifically in tumours lowers the binding potential of radiotracers.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24704692/
Kinetic analysis of [11C]McN5652: a serotonin transporter radioligand,"Z Szabo, U Scheffel, W B Mathews, H T Ravert, K Szabo, M Kraut, S Palmon, G A Ricaurte, R F Dannals","The impulse response function of a radioligand is the most fundamental way to describe its pharmacokinetics and to assess its tissue uptake and retention pattern. This study investigates the impulse response function of [11C](+)McN5652, a radioligand used for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of the serotonin transporter (SERT) in the brain. Dynamic PET studies were performed in eight healthy volunteers injected with [11C](+)McN5652 and subsequently with its pharmacologically inactive enantiomer [11C](-)McN5652. The impulse response function was calculated by deconvolution analysis of regional time-activity curves, and its peak value (f(max)), its retention value at 75 minutes (fT), and its normalized retention (f(rel) = fT/f(max)) were obtained. Alternatively, compartmental models were applied to calculate the apparent total distribution volume (DV(T)) and its specific binding component (DV(S)). Both the noncompartmental (fT,f(rel)) and the compartmental parameters (DV) were investigated with and without correction for nonspecific binding by simple subtraction of the corresponding value obtained with [11C](-)McN5652. The impulse response function obtained by deconvolution analysis demonstrated high tracer extraction followed by a slow decline in the form of a monoexponential function. Statistical analysis revealed that the best compartmental model in terms of analysis of variance F and condition number of the parameter variance-covariance matrix was the one that was based on a single tissue compartment with parameters k1 and k2 and that also included the parameter of regional cerebral blood volume (BV). The parameter f(rel) demonstrated low between-subject variance (coefficient of variation [CV] = 19%), a midbrain to cerebellum ratio of 1.85, and high correlation with the known density of SERT (r = 0.787 where r is the coefficient of linear correlation between the parameter and the known density of SERT). After correction for nonspecific binding, f(rel) demonstrated further improvement in correlation (r = 0.814) and midbrain to cerebellum ratio (3.09). The variance of the distribution volumes was acceptable when the logarithmic transform lnDV was used instead of DV (17% for the three-parameter model), but correlation of this compartmental parameter was slightly less (r = 0.652 for the three-parameter model) than the correlation of the noncompartmental f(rel) with the known density of SERT, and the midbrain to cerebellum ratio was only 1.5 (uncorrected) and 1.8 (corrected). At the expense of increasing variance, the correlation was increased after correction for nonspecific binding using the inactive enantiomer (r = 0.694; CV = 22%). These results indicate that the kinetics of [11C](+)McN5652 can best be described by a one-tissue compartment model with three parameters (k1, k2, and BV), and that both the noncompartmental parameter f(rel) and the compartmental distribution volumes have the potential for quantitative estimation of the density of SERT. Further validation of the radioligand in experimental and clinical situations is warranted.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10478648/
Selection of weighting factors for quantification of PET radioligand binding using simplified reference tissue models with noisy input functions,"M D Normandin, R A Koeppe, E D Morris","Input function noise contributes to model-predicted values and should be accounted for during parameter estimation. This problem has been examined in the context of PET data analysis using a noisy image-derived arterial input function. Huesman and Mazoyer (1987 Phys. Med. Biol 32 1569-79) incorporated the effect of error in the measured input function into the objective function and observed a subsequent improvement in the accuracy of parameters estimated from a kinetic model of cardiac blood flow. Such a treatment has not been applied to the reference region models commonly used to analyze dynamic positron emission tomography data with receptor-ligand tracers. Here, we propose a strategy for selection of weighting factors that accounts for noise in the reference region input function and test the method on two common formulations of the simplified reference tissue model (SRTM). We present a simulation study which demonstrates that the proposed weighting approach improves the accuracy of estimated binding potential at high noise levels and when the reference tissue and target regions of interest are of comparable size. In the second simulation experiment, we show that using a small, homogeneous reference tissue with our weighting technique may have advantages over input functions derived from a larger (and thus less noisy), heterogeneous region with conventional weighting. A comparative analysis of clinical [(11)C]flumazenil data found a small but significant increase in estimated binding potential when using the proposed weighting method, consistent with the finding of reduced negative bias in our simulation study. The weighting strategy described here accounts for noise in the reference region input function and may improve the performance of the SRTM in applications where data are noisy and the reference region is relatively small. This technique may offer similar benefits to other models using reference region inputs, particularly those derived from the SRTM.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22241524/
Small animal imaging using a conventional gamma camera exemplified in studies on the striatal dopaminergic system,"Christoph Scherfler, Clemens Decristoforo","Background: Small animal imaging has recently been the subject of increasing interest and specific imaging devices in particular for positron emission tomography (PET) have been developed. To bypass limitations arising from high acquisition costs and dependence on an in-house cyclotron unit inevitably associated with PET, a conventional gamma camera has been equipped with a pinhole collimator and used to visualize striatal pre- and post-synaptic dopaminergic function in rats measured by the dopamine transporter ligand [123I]beta-CIT and the dopamine D2/dopamine D3 receptor ligand [123I]IBZM. In order to precisely estimate brain regions of low radioligand uptake, single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) images were coregistered onto an MRI template.

Material and methods: Our pinhole SPECT/MRI approach has been employed in animal models of pre- and postsynaptic dopaminergic dysfunction. The physical characteristics of the scanner, the tracer kinetics and modelling as well as image postprocessing have been addressed and associated intrinsic problems and constraints discussed.

Conclusions: An outlook has been provided on the application of pinhole SPECT and MRI coregistration towards non-invasive investigations of drug-receptor interactions and binding characteristics of newly developed radiopharmaceuticals.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16791797/
Identifiability analysis and parameter identification of an in vivo ligand-receptor model from PET data,"J Delforge, A Syrota, B M Mazoyer","Identifiability problem is a very important topic in the framework of model justification and not accounting for it during the modeling procedure can lead to meaningless results. While studying the receptor-ligand model parameter estimation from dynamic positron emission tomography data, each of the three possible conclusions to the identifiability problem (i.e., unidentifiable model, multiple solutions, or unique solution) are reached depending on the experimental protocol used. The identification of the model parameters from data obtained with a single tracer injection leads to disappointing numerical results since most of the parameters have to be considered as unidentifiable. A protocol including two injections, a first injection of the labeled ligand and a second injection of the cold ligand (displacement experiment) leads to two very different numerical solutions, which is surprising since such multiplicity of solutions was not indicated by a preliminary theoretical identifiability study. We show that a three-injections protocol, including both a displacement and coinjection experiment, allows to determine which of these two solutions is biologically valid.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2394453/
An iterative image-based inter-frame motion compensation method for dynamic brain PET imaging,"Tao Sun, Yaping Wu, Yan Bai, Zhenguo Wang, Chushu Shen, Wei Wang, Chenwei Li, Zhanli Hu, Dong Liang, Xin Liu, Hairong Zheng, Yongfeng Yang, Meiyun Wang","As a non-invasive imaging tool, positron emission tomography (PET) plays an important role in brain science and disease research. Dynamic acquisition is one way of brain PET imaging. Its wide application in clinical research has often been hindered by practical challenges, such as patient involuntary movement, which could degrade both image quality and the accuracy of the quantification. This is even more obvious in scans of patients with neurodegeneration or mental disorders. Conventional motion compensation methods were either based on images or raw measured data, were shown to be able to reduce the effect of motion on the image quality. As for a dynamic PET scan, motion compensation can be challenging as tracer kinetics and relatively high noise can be present in dynamic frames. In this work, we propose an image-based inter-frame motion compensation approach specifically designed for dynamic brain PET imaging. Our method has an iterative implementation that only requires reconstructed images, based on which the inter-frame subject movement can be estimated and compensated. The method utilized tracer-specific kinetic modelling and can deal with simple and complex movement patterns. The synthesized phantom study showed that the proposed method can compensate for the simulated motion in scans with18F-FDG,18F-Fallypride and18F-AV45. Fifteen dynamic18F-FDG patient scans with motion artifacts were also processed. The quality of the recovered image was superior to the one of the non-corrected images and the corrected images with other image-based methods. The proposed method enables retrospective image quality control for dynamic brain PET imaging, hence facilitating the applications of dynamic PET in clinics and research.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35021156/
Nonparametric Residue Analysis of Dynamic PET Data With Application to Cerebral FDG Studies in Normals,"Finbarr O'Sullivan, Mark Muzi, Alexander M Spence, David M Mankoff, Janet N O'Sullivan, Niall Fitzgerald, George C Newman, Kenneth A Krohn","Kinetic analysis is used to extract metabolic information from dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) uptake data. The theory of indicator dilutions, developed in the seminal work of Meier and Zierler (1954), provides a probabilistic framework for representation of PET tracer uptake data in terms of a convolution between an arterial input function and a tissue residue. The residue is a scaled survival function associated with tracer residence in the tissue. Nonparametric inference for the residue, a deconvolution problem, provides a novel approach to kinetic analysis-critically one that is not reliant on specific compartmental modeling assumptions. A practical computational technique based on regularized cubic B-spline approximation of the residence time distribution is proposed. Nonparametric residue analysis allows formal statistical evaluation of specific parametric models to be considered. This analysis needs to properly account for the increased flexibility of the nonparametric estimator. The methodology is illustrated using data from a series of cerebral studies with PET and fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) in normal subjects. Comparisons are made between key functionals of the residue, tracer flux, flow, etc., resulting from a parametric (the standard two-compartment of Phelps et al. 1979) and a nonparametric analysis. Strong statistical evidence against the compartment model is found. Primarily these differences relate to the representation of the early temporal structure of the tracer residence-largely a function of the vascular supply network. There are convincing physiological arguments against the representations implied by the compartmental approach but this is the first time that a rigorous statistical confirmation using PET data has been reported. The compartmental analysis produces suspect values for flow but, notably, the impact on the metabolic flux, though statistically significant, is limited to deviations on the order of 3%-4%. The general advantage of the nonparametric residue analysis is the ability to provide a valid kinetic quantitation in the context of studies where there may be heterogeneity or other uncertainty about the accuracy of a compartmental model approximation of the tissue residue.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19830267/
Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor expression after myocardial infarction: Imaging study using 68Ga-NODAGA-exendin-4 positron emission tomography,"Mia Ståhle, Ville Kytö, Max Kiugel, Heidi Liljenbäck, Olli Metsälä, Meeri Käkelä, Xiang-Guo Li, Vesa Oikonen, Pekka Saukko, Pirjo Nuutila, Juhani Knuuti, Anne Roivainen, Antti Saraste","Background: Activation of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) signaling protects against cardiac dysfunction and remodeling after myocardial infarction (MI). The aim of the study was to evaluate68Ga-NODAGA-exendin-4 positron emission tomography (PET) for assessment of GLP-1R expression after MI in rats.

Methods and results: Rats were studied at 3 days, 1 and 12 weeks after permanent coronary ligation or a sham-operation. Rats were injected with68Ga-NODAGA-exendin-4 and scanned with PET and contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) followed by digital autoradiography and histology of left ventricle tissue sections.68Ga-NODAGA-exendin-4 PET/CT showed focally increased tracer uptake in the infarcted regions peaking at 3 days and continuing at 1 week after MI. Pre-treatment with an unlabeled exendin-4 peptide significantly reduced68Ga-NODAGA-exendin-4 uptake. By autoradiography,68Ga-NODAGA-exendin-4 uptake was 8.6-fold higher in the infarcted region and slightly increased also in the remote, non-infarcted myocardium at 1 week and 12 weeks post-MI compared with sham. Uptake of68Ga-NODAGA-exendin-4 correlated with the amount of CD68-positive macrophages in the infarcted area and alpha-smooth muscle actin staining in the remote myocardium.

Conclusions: 68Ga-NODAGA-exendin-4 PET detects up-regulation of cardiac GLP-1R expression during healing of MI in rats and may provide information on the activated repair mechanisms after ischemic myocardial injury.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30547299/
Effects of Smoking Cessation on Presynaptic Dopamine Function of Addicted Male Smokers,"Lena Rademacher, Susanne Prinz, Oliver Winz, Karsten Henkel, Claudia A Dietrich, Jörn Schmaljohann, Siamak Mohammadkhani Shali, Ina Schabram, Christian Stoppe, Paul Cumming, Ralf-Dieter Hilgers, Yoshitaka Kumakura, Mark Coburn, Felix M Mottaghy, Gerhard Gründer, Ingo Vernaleken","Background: There is evidence of abnormal cerebral dopamine transmission in nicotine-dependent smokers, but it is unclear whether dopaminergic abnormalities are due to acute nicotine abuse or whether they persist with abstinence. We addressed this question by conducting longitudinal positron emission tomography (PET) examination of smokers before and after 3 months of abstinence.

Methods: We obtained baseline 6-[(18)F]fluoro-L-DOPA (FDOPA)-PET scans in 15 nonsmokers and 30 nicotine-dependent smokers, who either smoked as per their usual habit or were in acute withdrawal. All smokers then underwent cessation treatment, and successful abstainers were re-examined by FDOPA-PET after 3 months of abstinence (n = 15). Uptake of FDOPA was analyzed using a steady-state model yielding estimates of the dopamine synthesis capacity (K); the turnover of tracer dopamine formed in living brain (kloss); and the tracer distribution volume (Vd), which is an index of dopamine storage capacity.

Results: Compared with nonsmokers, K was 15% to 20% lower in the caudate nuclei of consuming smokers. Intraindividual comparisons of consumption and long-term abstinence revealed significant increases in K in the right dorsal and left ventral caudate nuclei. Relative to acute withdrawal, Vd significantly decreased in the right ventral and dorsal caudate after prolonged abstinence. Severity of nicotine dependence significantly correlated with dopamine synthesis capacity and dopamine turnover in the bilateral ventral putamen of consuming smokers.

Conclusions: The results suggest a lower dopamine synthesis capacity in nicotine-dependent smokers that appears to normalize with abstinence. Further investigations are needed to clarify the role of dopamine in nicotine addiction to help develop smoking prevention and cessation treatments.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26803340/
Validation of image-derived input function using a long axial field of view PET/CT scanner for two different tracers,"Xavier Palard-Novello, Denise Visser, Nelleke Tolboom, Charlotte L C Smith, Gerben Zwezerijnen, Elsmarieke van de Giessen, Marijke E den Hollander, Frederik Barkhof, Albert D Windhorst, Bart Nm van Berckel, Ronald Boellaard, Maqsood Yaqub","Background: Accurate image-derived input function (IDIF) from highly sensitive large axial field of view (LAFOV) PET/CT scanners could avoid the need of invasive blood sampling for kinetic modelling. The aim is to validate the use of IDIF for two kinds of tracers, 3 different IDIF locations and 9 different reconstruction settings.

Methods: Eight [18F]FDG and 10 [18F]DPA-714 scans were acquired respectively during 70 and 60 min on the Vision Quadra PET/CT system. PET images were reconstructed using various reconstruction settings. IDIFs were taken from ascending aorta (AA), descending aorta (DA), and left ventricular cavity (LV). The calibration factor (CF) extracted from the comparison between the IDIFs and the manual blood samples as reference was used for IDIFs accuracy and precision assessment. To illustrate the effect of various calibrated-IDIFs on Patlak linearization for [18F]FDG and Logan linearization for [18F]DPA-714, the same target time-activity curves were applied for each calibrated-IDIF.

Results: For [18F]FDG, the accuracy and precision of the IDIFs were high (mean CF ≥ 0.82, SD ≤ 0.06). Compared to the striatum influx (Ki) extracted using calibrated AA IDIF with the updated European Association of Nuclear Medicine Research Ltd. standard reconstruction (EARL2), Kimean differences were < 2% using the other calibrated IDIFs. For [18F]DPA714, high accuracy of the IDIFs was observed (mean CF ≥ 0.86) except using absolute scatter correction, DA and LV (respectively mean CF = 0.68, 0.47 and 0.44). However, the precision of the AA IDIFs was low (SD ≥ 0.10). Compared to the distribution volume (VT) in a frontal region obtained using calibrated continuous arterial sampler input function as reference, VTmean differences were small using calibrated AA IDIFs (for example VTmean difference = -5.3% using EARL2), but higher using calibrated DA and LV IDIFs (respectively + 12.5% and + 19.1%).

Conclusions: For [18F]FDG, IDIF do not need calibration against manual blood samples. For [18F]DPA-714, AA IDIF can replace continuous arterial sampling for simplified kinetic quantification but only with calibration against arterial blood samples. The accuracy and precision of IDIF from LAFOV PET/CT system depend on tracer, reconstruction settings and IDIF VOI locations, warranting careful optimization.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38472680/
Input function and modeling for determining bone metabolic flux using [18 F] sodium fluoride PET imaging: A step-by-step guide,"Tanuj Puri, Michelle L Frost, Amelia E B Moore, Gary J R Cook, Glen M Blake","Studies of skeletal metabolism using measurements of bone metabolic flux (Ki) obtained with [18F] sodium fluoride ([18F]NaF) positron emission tomography (PET) scans have been used in clinical research for the last 30 years. The technique has proven useful as an imaging biomarker in trials of novel drug treatments for osteoporosis and investigating other metabolic bone diseases, including chronic kidney disease mineral and bone disorder. It has also been shown to be valuable in metastatic bone disease in breast cancer patients and may have potential in other cancer types, such as prostate cancer, to assess early bone fracture risk. However, these studies have usually required a 60-min dynamic PET scan and measurement of the arterial input function (AIF), making them difficult to translate into the clinic for diagnostic purposes. We have previously proposed a simplified method that estimates the Kivalue at an imaging site from a short (4-min) static scan and venous blood samples. A key advantage of this method is that, by acquiring a series of static scans, values of Kican be quickly measured at multiple sites using a single injection of the tracer. To date, the widespread use of [18F]NaF PET has been limited by the need to measure the AIF required for the mathematical modeling of tracer kinetics to derive Kiand other kinetic parameters. In this report, we review different methods of measuring the AIF, including direct arterial sampling, the use of a semi-population input function (SP-AIF), and image-derived input function, the latter two requiring only two or three venous blood samples obtained between 30 and 60 min after injection. We provide an SP-AIF model and a spreadsheet for calculating Kivalues using the static scan method that others can use to study bone metabolism in metabolic and metastatic bone diseases without requiring invasive arterial blood sampling. The method shortens scan times, simplifies procedures, and reduces the cost of multicenter trials without losing accuracy or precision.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36433629/
Physiologic smoothing of blood time-activity curves for PET data analysis,M M Graham,"Blood or plasma time-activity curves (TACs) are used as the input function for mathematical models of tracer kinetics in several applications including PET. Uncertainty associated with both the blood data and the PET tissue data can result in uncertainty in the estimates of metabolic rates, blood flow, etc.

Methods: This article presents an approach to reduce the uncertainty in the blood TAC by fitting a model to the curve. The model includes a choice of bolus or infusion input and has three compartments (plasma, interstitial fluid and tissue fluid) with exchange between them. There is a parameter for loss from the plasma compartment. To test the utility of smoothing blood TACs with this approach, a program was set up, using the fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) model, with simulated noisy blood and tissue TACs. The smoothed blood TAC was compared to a linearly interpolated TAC as the input function with a compartmental model parameter estimation program and with graphical analysis.

Results: With a well sampled blood TAC (19 points), the model approach is somewhat more accurate than linear interpolation if the s.d. of noise added to the data exceeded 10%. With sparsely sampled blood TACs (five points) or with a large gap in the blood TAC, the modeled approach was markedly better. For graphical analysis, the model smoothed TAC was also more accurate, although, in general, the results were not as sensitive to the input function.

Conclusion: This approach, using a physiologically reasonable model to smooth the blood TAC, is a useful aid in PET data analysis, particularly when the data are quite noisy or when there are large gaps in the data.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9225813/
Kinetics and modeling of L-6-[18F]fluoro-dopa in human positron emission tomographic studies,"S C Huang, D C Yu, J R Barrio, S Grafton, W P Melega, J M Hoffman, N Satyamurthy, J C Mazziotta, M E Phelps","Kinetics of L-3,4-dihydroxy-6-[18F]fluorophenylalanine (FDOPA) in striatum and cerebellum were measured in 10 normal human subjects with positron emission tomography (PET) from 0 to 120 min after an intravenous bolus injection of the tracer. The time course of the arterial plasma concentrations of the tracer and its metabolites was also assayed biochemically. FDOPA compartmental models that are based on biochemical information were investigated for their consistency with the measured striatal and cerebellar tissue kinetics. A modeling approach was also developed for separating plasma FDOPA and metabolite time-activity curves from the measured total 18F time-activity curve in plasma. Results showed that a model consisting of three separate compartments for tissue FDOPA, tissue 6-[18F]fluorodopamine (FDA) and its metabolites, and tissue L-3,4-dihydroxy-6-[18F]fluoro-3-O-methylphenylalanine (3-OMFD) could describe adequately the striatal kinetics in humans. Based on this model, the FDOPA transport constant across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) (K1), the FDOPA decarboxylation rate constant (k3), and the turn-over rate constant of FDA and its metabolites (k4) could be estimated by model fitting to the tissue kinetics and were found for the normal subjects to be 0.031 +/- 0.006 ml/min/g (mean +/- SD), 0.041 +/- 0.015/min, and 0.004 +/- 0.002/min, respectively. About 50% of the FDOPA that crossed the BBB from plasma to striatum was decarboxylated. The decarboxylation constant with respect to plasma FDOPA (K3) was 0.015 +/- 0.003 ml/min/g. The BBB transport corresponded to a permeability-surface area product of 0.032 ml/min/g for FDOPA. For 3-OMFD, the BBB transport was 1.7 times faster. The effects of tissue heterogeneity on the FDOPA kinetics and on the estimated model parameters were also investigated. The usefulness and implications of these findings for interpretation of PET FDOPA studies are discussed.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1939385/
PET studies of patients with partial epilepsy: visual interpretation vs. semi-quantification/quantification,"B Sadzot, R Debets, P Maquet, C Comar, G Franck","One of the advantages of PET is to allow for precise regional measurements of radioactive tracers in slices of brain. Furthermore, complex compartment modelling methods have been designed to transform the regional radioactive concentrations into biological units. The question is often raised whether quantification of PET studies is necessary in clinical practice. In epileptology, the regional biochemical changes associated with temporal lobe epilepsy are easily detected by experienced eyes and quantification is not required for diagnosis purposes. By contrast, inter-patient or inter-population comparisons can only be performed if regional measures have been obtained; if the PET method has been previously validated, simple measurements (regional activity) are sufficient and (kinetic) compartmental modelling is not necessary in routine.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8209641/
NiftyPAD - Novel Python Package for Quantitative Analysis of Dynamic PET Data,"Jieqing Jiao, Fiona Heeman, Rachael Dixon, Catriona Wimberley, Isadora Lopes Alves, Juan Domingo Gispert, Adriaan A Lammertsma, Bart N M van Berckel, Casper da Costa-Luis, Pawel Markiewicz, David M Cash, M Jorge Cardoso, Sebastién Ourselin, Maqsood Yaqub, Frederik Barkhof","Current PET datasets are becoming larger, thereby increasing the demand for fast and reproducible processing pipelines. This paper presents a freely available, open source, Python-based software package called NiftyPAD, for versatile analyses of static, full or dual-time window dynamic brain PET data. The key novelties of NiftyPAD are the analyses of dual-time window scans with reference input processing, pharmacokinetic modelling with shortened PET acquisitions through the incorporation of arterial spin labelling (ASL)-derived relative perfusion measures, as well as optional PET data-based motion correction. Results obtained with NiftyPAD were compared with the well-established software packages PPET and QModeling for a range of kinetic models. Clinical data from eight subjects scanned with four different amyloid tracers were used to validate the computational performance. NiftyPAD achieved [Formula: see text] correlation with PPET, with absolute difference [Formula: see text] for linearised Logan and MRTM2 methods, and [Formula: see text] correlation with QModeling, with absolute difference [Formula: see text] for basis function based SRTM and SRTM2 models. For the recently published SRTM ASL method, which is unavailable in existing software packages, high correlations with negligible bias were observed with the full scan SRTM in terms of non-displaceable binding potential ([Formula: see text]), indicating reliable model implementation in NiftyPAD. Together, these findings illustrate that NiftyPAD is versatile, flexible, and produces comparable results with established software packages for quantification of dynamic PET data. It is freely available ( https://github.com/AMYPAD/NiftyPAD ), and allows for multi-platform usage. The modular setup makes adding new functionalities easy, and the package is lightweight with minimal dependencies, making it easy to use and integrate into existing processing pipelines.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36622500/

[(18)F]8 exhibits a high affinity to Aβ and suitable brain uptake kinetics combined with a high metabolic stability in the brain. In a double transgenic APP/PS1 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease, we demonstrated a specific uptake of [(18)F]8 in Aβ-containing telencephalic brain regions. The specific binding of [(18)F]8 to Aβ was confirmed by regional brain biodistribution and autoradiography and correlated to immunohistochemistry staining. Analysis of brain sections of APP/PS1 mouse injected with a cocktail of [(18)F]8 and reference compound [(3)H]PiB revealed that the two tracers bind to Aβ plaques in the brain of mouse in a comparable binding pattern. [(18)F]8 represents the first high-contrast PET imaging agent for detection of Aβ plaques in transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease and holds promise for transfer to a clinical evaluation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24900362/
Quantification of [Carbonyl-(11)C]WAY-100635 binding: considerations on the cerebellum,"V Oikonen, T Allonen, K Någren, J Kajander, J Hietala","The specific binding of [carbonyl-(11)C]WAY-100635 to 5-hydroxytryptamine(1A) receptors was quantitated using different kinetic models. Ten healthy subjects were studied using a GE Advance PET scanner. We suggest that tissue heterogeneity explains part of the nonspecific binding seen in cerebellum, which leads to an underestimation of binding potential with reference tissue methods. The nonlinear three-compartmental model with metabolite-corrected plasma input provides accurate estimates of receptor binding because of the favorable kinetics of tracer in the brain and circulation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10962255/
Assessment of extrastriatal vesicular monoamine transporter binding site density using stereoisomers of [11C]dihydrotetrabenazine,"R A Koeppe, K A Frey, D E Kuhl, M R Kilbourn","Previous studies have demonstrated the utility of [11C]dihydrotetrabenazine ([11C]DTBZ) as a ligand for in vivo imaging of the vesicular monoamine transporter system. The (+)-isomer has a high affinity (approximately 1 nmol/L) for the vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT2) binding site, whereas the (-)-isomer has an extremely low affinity (approximately 2 micromol/L). Efforts to model dynamic (+)-[11C]DTBZ data demonstrate the difficulty in separating the specific binding component from the free plus nonspecific component of the total positron emission tomography (PET) measure. The authors' previous PET work, as well as in vitro studies, indicate that there is little specific VMAT2 binding in neocortical regions. However, precise determination of in vivo binding levels have not been made, leaving important questions unanswered. At one extreme, is there sufficient specific binding in cortex or other extrastriate regions to be estimated reliably with PET? At the other extreme, is there sufficiently little binding in cortex so that it can be used as a reference region representing nonsaturable tracer uptake? The authors address these questions using paired studies with both active (+) and inactive (-) stereoisomers of [11C]DTBZ. Six normal control subjects were scanned twice, 2 hours apart, after injections of 16 mCi of (+)- and (-)-[11C]DTBZ (order counter-balanced). Three-dimensional PET acquisition consisted of 15 frames over 60 minutes for each scan. Arterial samples were acquired throughout, plasma counted, and corrected for radiolabeled metabolites. Analysis of specific binding was assessed by comparison of total distribution volume measures from the (+)- and (-)-[11C]DTBZ scans. The authors' findings indicate that only approximately 5% of the cortical signal in (+)-[11C]DTBZ scans results from binding to VMAT2 sites. The strongest extrastriatal signal comes from the midbrain regions where approximately 30% of the PET measure results from specific binding. The authors conclude that (1) the density of VMAT2 binding sites in cortical regions is not high enough to be quantified reliably with DTBZ PET, and (2) binding does appear to be low enough so that cortex can be used as a free plus nonspecific reference region for striatum.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10598942/
Positron emission tomography for measurement of copper fluxes in live organisms,Fangyu Peng,"Copper is an essential nutrient for the physiology of live organisms, but excessive copper can be harmful. Copper radioisotopes are used for measurement of copper fluxes in live organisms using a radioactivity assay of body fluids or whole-body positron emission tomography (PET). Hybrid positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET/CT) is a versatile tool for real-time measurement of copper fluxes combining the high sensitivity and quantification capability of PET and the superior spatial resolution of CT for anatomic localization of radioactive tracer activity. Kinetic analysis of copper metabolism in the liver and extrahepatic tissues of Atp7b(-/-) knockout mice, a mouse model of Wilson's disease, demonstrated the feasibility of measuring copper fluxes in live organisms with PET/CT using copper-64 chloride ((64) CuCl2 ) as a radioactive tracer ((64) CuCl2 -PET/CT).

Investigation of these receptors in vivo depends on the availability of imaging agents such as radioactively labelled ligands applicable in positron emission tomography (PET). We report on a series of new ligands for α₇ nAChRs designed by the combination of dibenzothiophene dioxide as a novel hydrogen bond acceptor functionality with diazabicyclononane as an established cationic center. To assess the structure-activity relationship (SAR) of this new basic structure, we further modified the cationic center systematically by introduction of three different piperazine-based scaffolds. Based on in vitro binding affinity and selectivity, assessed by radioligand displacement studies at different rat and human nAChR subtypes and at the structurally related human 5-HT₃ receptor, we selected the compound 7-(1,4-diazabicyclo[3.2.2]nonan-4-yl)-2-fluorodibenzo-[b,d]thiophene 5,5-dioxide (10a) for radiolabeling and further evaluation in vivo. Radiosynthesis of [18F]10a was optimized and transferred to an automated module. Dynamic PET imaging studies with [18F]10a in piglets and a monkey demonstrated high uptake of radioactivity in the brain, followed by washout and target-region specific accumulation under baseline conditions. Kinetic analysis of [18F]10a in pig was performed using a two-tissue compartment model with arterial-derived input function. Our initial evaluation revealed that the dibenzothiophene-based PET radioligand [18F]10a ([18F]DBT-10) has high potential to provide clinically relevant information about the expression and availability of α₇ nAChR in the brain.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26473809/
Effects of anesthesia and species on the uptake or binding of radioligands in vivo in the Göttingen minipig,"Aage K O Alstrup, Anne M Landau, James E Holden, Steen Jakobsen, Anna C Schacht, Helene Audrain, Gregers Wegener, Axel K Hansen, Albert Gjedde, Doris J Doudet","Progress in neuroscience research often involves animals, as no adequate alternatives exist to animal models of living systems. However, both the physiological characteristics of the species used and the effects of anesthesia raise questions of common concern. Here, we demonstrate the confounding influences of these effects on tracer binding in positron emission tomography (PET). We determined the effects of two routinely used anesthetics (isoflurane and propofol) on the binding of two tracers of monoamine function, [(11)C]SCH23390, a tracer of the dopamine D1 and D5 receptors, and the alpha2-adrenoceptor antagonist, [(11)C]yohimbine, in Göttingen minipigs. The kinetics of SCH23390 in the pigs differed from those of our earlier studies in primates. With two different graphical analyses of uptake of SCH23390, the initial clearance values of this tracer were higher with isoflurane than with propofol anesthesia, indicative of differences in blood flow, whereas no significant differences were observed for the volumes of distribution of yohimbine. The study underscores the importance of differences of anesthesia and species when the properties of radioligands are evaluated under different circumstances that may affect blood flow and tracer uptake. These differences must be considered in the choice of a particular animal species and mode of anesthesia for a particular application.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24083242/
A Monte Carlo study of the dependence of early frame sampling on uncertainty and bias in pharmacokinetic parameters from dynamic PET,"Ida Häggström, Jan Axelsson, Charles Ross Schmidtlein, Mikael Karlsson, Anders Garpebring, Lennart Johansson, Jens Sörensen, Anne Larsson","Compartmental modeling of dynamic PET data enables quantification of tracer kinetics in vivo, through the calculated model parameters. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of early frame sampling and reconstruction method on pharmacokinetic parameters obtained from a 2-tissue model, in terms of bias and uncertainty (SD).

Methods: The GATE Monte Carlo software was used to simulate 2 × 15 dynamic 3'-deoxy-3'-(18)F-fluorothymidine ((18)F-FLT) brain PET studies, typical in terms of noise level and kinetic parameters. The data were reconstructed by both 3-dimensional (3D) filtered backprojection with reprojection (3DRP) and 3D ordered-subset expectation maximization (OSEM) into 6 dynamic image sets with different early frame durations of 1, 2, 4, 6, 10, and 15 s. Bias and SD were evaluated for fitted parameter estimates, calculated from regions of interest.

Results: The 2-tissue-model parameter estimates K1, k2, and fraction of arterial blood in tissue depended on early frame sampling, and a sampling of 6-15 s generally minimized bias and SD. The shortest sampling of 1 s yielded a 25% and 42% larger bias than the other schemes, for 3DRP and OSEM, respectively, and a parameter uncertainty that was 10%-70% higher. The schemes from 4 to 15 s were generally not significantly different in regards to bias and SD. Typically, the reconstruction method 3DRP yielded less frame-sampling dependence and less uncertain results, compared with OSEM, but was on average more biased.

Conclusion: Of the 6 sampling schemes investigated in this study, an early frame duration of 6-15 s generally kept both bias and uncertainty to a minimum, for both 3DRP and OSEM reconstructions. Very-short frames of 1 s should be avoided because they typically resulted in the largest parameter bias and uncertainty. Furthermore, 3DRP may be preferred over OSEM for short frames with poor statistics.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25613339/
Analysis of (R)- and (S)-[(11)C]rolipram kinetics in canine myocardium for the evaluation of phosphodiesterase-4 with PET,"Mireille Lortie, Jean N DaSilva, Miran Kenk, Stephanie Thorn, Darryl Davis, David Birnie, Rob S B Beanlands, Robert A deKemp","Purpose: (R)-[(11)C]rolipram and (S)-[(11)C]rolipram have been proposed to investigate phosphodiesterase-4 and, indirectly, cAMP-mediated signaling with PET. This study assessed binding of these tracers to phosphodiesterase-4 in canine myocardium.

Procedures: Seven dogs underwent (R)-[(11)C]rolipram and (S)-[(11)C]rolipram dynamic PET imaging at baseline and with co-injection of saturating doses of (R)-rolipram. Dual-input compartment models were applied to estimate the volumes of distribution (V(T)).

Results: The model comprising one compartment for unmetabolized tracer and one compartment for labeled metabolites provided excellent fits to data acquired with (S)-[(11)C]rolipram at baseline and with both enantiomers during co-injection scans. Use of two compartments for unmetabolized (R)-[(11)C]rolipram at baseline was warranted according to Akaike and Schwarz criteria. V(T) estimates obtained with these models were robust (CV ≤ 8.2%) and reproducible (CV ≤ 15%).

Conclusion: An important fraction (~65%) of the V (T) of (R)-[(11)C]rolipram at baseline reflects specific binding. Thus, the latter may be a useful index of phosphodiesterase-4 levels in canine myocardium.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21424298/
In vivo imaging of brain androgen receptors in rats: a [(18)F]FDHT PET study,"M A Khayum, J Doorduin, I F Antunes, C Kwizera, R Zijlma, J A den Boer, R A J O Dierckx, E F J de Vries","Introduction: Steroid hormones like androgens play an important role in the development and maintenance of several brain functions. Androgens can act through androgen receptors (AR) in the brain. This study aims to demonstrate the feasibility of positron emission tomography (PET) with 16β-[(18)F]fluoro-5α-dihydrotestosterone ([(18)F]FDHT) to image AR expression in the brain.

Methods: Male Wistar rats were either orchiectomized to inhibit endogenous androgen production or underwent sham-surgery. Fifteen days after surgery, rats were subjected to a 90-min dynamic [(18)F]FDHT PET scan with arterial blood sampling. In a subset of orchiectomized rats, 1mg/kg dihydrotestosterone was co-injected with the tracer in order to saturate the AR. Plasma samples were analyzed for the presence of radioactive metabolites by radio-TLC. Pharmacokinetic modeling was performed to quantify brain kinetics of the tracer. After the PET scan, the animals were terminated for ex-vivo biodistribution.

Results: PET imaging and ex vivo biodistribution studies showed low [(18)F]FDHT uptake in all brain regions, except pituitary. [(18)F]FDHT uptake in the surrounding cranial bones was high and increased over time. [(18)F]FDHT was rapidly metabolized in rats. Metabolism was significantly faster in orchiectomized rats than in sham-orchiectomized rats. Quantitative analysis of PET data indicated substantial spill-over of activity from cranial bones into peripheral brain regions, which prevented further analysis of peripheral brain regions. Logan graphical analysis and kinetic modeling using 1- and 2-tissue compartment models showed reversible and homogenously distributed tracer uptake in central brain regions. [(18)F]FDHT uptake in the brain could not be blocked by endogenous androgens or administration of dihydrotestosterone.

Conclusion: The results of this study indicate that imaging of AR availability in rat brain with [(18)F]FDHT PET is not feasible. The low AR expression in the brain, the rapid metabolism of [(18)F]FDHT in rats and the poor brain penetration of the tracer likely contributed to the poor performance of [(18)F]FDHT PET in this study.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25735222/
Head-to-head comparison of tau positron emission tomography tracers [18F]flortaucipir and [18F]RO948,"Ruben Smith, Michael Schöll, Antoine Leuzy, Jonas Jögi, Tomas Ohlsson, Olof Strandberg, Oskar Hansson","Purpose: [18F]flortaucipir binds to paired helical filament tau and accurately identifies tau in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, ""off-target"" binding interferes with the quantification of [18F]flortaucipir in several brain regions. Recently, other tau PET tracers have been developed. Here, we compare [18F]flortaucipir with the novel tau tracer [18F]RO948 head-to-head in vivo.

Methods: We included 18 participants with AD, three with amyloid-β-positive amnestic mild cognitive impairment, and four healthy controls. All underwent [18F]flortaucipir (80-100 min) and [18F]RO948 (70-90) PET scans within approximately 1 month. Four study participants underwent 0-100-min dynamic scanning. Standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs) were created using an inferior cerebellar reference region.

Results: Neocortical tracer retention was highly comparable using both SUVR and distribution volume ratio-1 values obtained from dynamic scans. However, [18F]RO948 retention was significantly higher in the entorhinal cortex and lower in the basal ganglia, thalamus, and choroid plexus compared with [18F]flortaucipir. Increased off-target binding was observed with age for both tracers. Several cases exhibited strong [18F]RO948 retention in the skull/meninges. This extra-cerebral signal, however, did not affect diagnostic accuracy and remained relatively unchanged when re-examining a subsample after 1 year. Kinetic modeling showed an increase in [18F]flortaucipir SUVR over the scanning interval, compared with a plateau for [18F]RO948.

Conclusion: [18F]RO948 and [18F]flortaucipir bound comparably in neocortical regions, but [18F]RO948 showed higher retention in the medial temporal lobe and lower intracerebral ""off-target"" binding. Time-dependent bias of SUVR estimates may prove less of a factor with [18F]RO948, compared with previous tau ligands.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31612245/
Kinetic quantitation of cerebral PET-FDG studies without concurrent blood sampling: statistical recovery of the arterial input function,"F O'Sullivan, J Kirrane, M Muzi, J N O'Sullivan, A M Spence, D A Mankoff, K A Krohn","Kinetic quantitation of dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) studies via compartmental modeling usually requires the time-course of the radio-tracer concentration in the arterial blood as an arterial input function (AIF). For human and animal imaging applications, significant practical difficulties are associated with direct arterial sampling and as a result there is substantial interest in alternative methods that require no blood sampling at the time of the study. A fixed population template input function derived from prior experience with directly sampled arterial curves is one possibility. Image-based extraction, including requisite adjustment for spillover and recovery, is another approach. The present work considers a hybrid statistical approach based on a penalty formulation in which the information derived from a priori studies is combined in a Bayesian manner with information contained in the sampled image data in order to obtain an input function estimate. The absolute scaling of the input is achieved by an empirical calibration equation involving the injected dose together with the subject's weight, height and gender. The technique is illustrated in the context of (18)F -Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET studies in humans. A collection of 79 arterially sampled FDG blood curves are used as a basis for a priori characterization of input function variability, including scaling characteristics. Data from a series of 12 dynamic cerebral FDG PET studies in normal subjects are used to evaluate the performance of the penalty-based AIF estimation technique. The focus of evaluations is on quantitation of FDG kinetics over a set of 10 regional brain structures. As well as the new method, a fixed population template AIF and a direct AIF estimate based on segmentation are also considered. Kinetics analyses resulting from these three AIFs are compared with those resulting from radially sampled AIFs. The proposed penalty-based AIF extraction method is found to achieve significant improvements over the fixed template and the segmentation methods. As well as achieving acceptable kinetic parameter accuracy, the quality of fit of the region of interest (ROI) time-course data based on the extracted AIF, matches results based on arterially sampled AIFs. In comparison, significant deviation in the estimation of FDG flux and degradation in ROI data fit are found with the template and segmentation methods. The proposed AIF extraction method is recommended for practical use.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19709971/

Receptors for vasopressin are categorized into at least 3 subtypes (V1A, V1B, and V2). Among these subtypes, the V1Breceptor (V1BR), highly expressed in the pituitary, is a primary regulator of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity and thus a potential target for treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression and anxiety.N-tert-butyl-2-[2-(6-methoxypyridine-2-yl)-6-[3-(morpholin-4-yl)propoxy]-4-oxopyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidin-3(4H)-yl]acetamide (TASP699) is a novel PET radiotracer with high affinity and selectivity for V1BR. The purpose of this study was to characterize the pharmacokinetic and binding profiles of11C-TASP699 in humans and determine its utility in an occupancy study of a novel V1BR antagonist, TS-121.Methods:Six healthy subjects were scanned twice with11C-TASP699 to determine the most appropriate kinetic model for analysis of imaging data and test-retest reproducibility of outcome measures. Nine healthy subjects were scanned before and after administration of TS-121 (active component: THY1773) to assess V1BR occupancy. Metabolite-corrected arterial input functions were obtained. Pituitary time-activity curves were analyzed with 1- and 2-tissue-compartment (1TC and 2TC, respectively) models and multilinear analysis 1 (MA1) to calculate distribution volume (VT). Relative test-retest variability (TRV) and absolute TRV were calculated. Since no brain region could be used as a reference region, percentage change inVTafter TS-121 administration was computed to assess its receptor occupancy and correlate with plasma concentrations of the drug.Results:11C-TASP699 showed high uptake in the pituitary and no uptake in any brain region. The 2TC model provided better fits than the 1TC model. Because the MA1VTestimates were similar to the 2TCVTestimates, MA1 was the model of choice. The TRV ofVTwas good (TRV, -2% ± 14%; absolute TRV, 11%). THY1773 reducedVTin a dose-dependent fashion, with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration of 177 ± 52 ng/mL in plasma concentration. There were no adverse events resulting in discontinuation from the study.Conclusion:11C-TASP699 was shown to display appropriate kinetics in humans, with substantial specific binding and good reproducibility ofVTTherefore, this tracer is suitable for measurement of V1BR in the human pituitary and the V1BR occupancy of TS-121, a novel V1BR antagonist.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34385336/
Assessment of myocardial perfusion by dynamic N-13 ammonia PET imaging: comparison of 2 tracer kinetic models,"Aliasghar Khorsand, Senta Graf, Christian Pirich, Otto Muzik, Kurt Kletter, Robert Dudczak, Gerald Maurer, Heinz Sochor, Ernst Schuster, Gerold Porenta","Background: Measurement of myocardial blood flow (MBF) by dynamic nitrogen 13 ammonia (NH(3)) positron emission tomography (PET) uses tracer kinetic modeling to analyze time-activity curves. We compared 2 commonly used models with 2 compartments (2C) and 3 compartments (3C) for quantification of MBF and coronary flow reserve (CFR).

Methods and results: Seventy-seven patients underwent NH(3) PET at rest and during hyperemia. Time-activity curves for blood pool and myocardial segments were obtained from short-axis images of dynamic sequences. Model fitting of the 2C and 3C models was performed to estimate regional MBF. MBF values calculated by 2C and 3C models were 0.98 +/- 0.31 mL.min(-1).g(-1) and 1.11 +/- 0.37 mL.min(-1).g(-1), respectively, at rest (P < .0001) and 2.79 +/- 1.18 mL.min(-1).g(-1) and 2.46 +/- 1.02 mL.min(-1).g(-1), respectively, during hyperemia (P < .01), resulting in a CFR of 3.02 +/- 1.31 and 2.39 +/- 1.15 (P < .0001), respectively. Significant correlation was observed between the 2 models for calculation of resting MBF (r = 0.78), hyperemic MBF (r = 0.68), and CFR (r = 0.68).

Conclusion: Measurements of MBF and CFR by 2C and 3C models are significantly related. However, quantification of MBF and CFR significantly differs between the methods. This difference needs to be considered when normal values are established or when measurements obtained with different methods need to be compared.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16084429/

The interpretation of the results is hampered by the lack of a suitable NMDA PET tracer for assessing the receptor occupancy of potential drugs. We have developed11C-Me-NB1 as a PET tracer for imaging GluN1/GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors and used it to investigate in rats the dose-dependent receptor occupancy of eliprodil, a GluN2B NTD modulator.Methods:11C-Me-NB1 was synthesized and characterized by in vitro displacement binding experiments with rat brain membranes, in vitro autoradiography, and blocking and displacement experiments by PET and PET kinetic modeling. Receptor occupancy by eliprodil was studied by PET with11C-Me-NB1.Results:11C-Me-NB1 was synthesized at 290 ± 90 GBq/μmol molar activity, 7.4 ± 1.9 GBq total activity at the end of synthesis (n= 17), and more than 99% radiochemical purity.11C-Me-NB1 binding in rat brain was blocked in vitro and in vivo by the NTD modulators Ro-25-6981 and eliprodil. Half-maximal receptor occupancy by eliprodil occurred at 1.5 μg/kg. At 1 mg/kg of eliprodil, a dose with reported neuroprotective effects, more than 99.5% of binding sites were occupied. In vitro,11C-Me-NB1 binding was independent of the σ-1 receptor (Sigma1R), and the Sigma1R agonist (+)-pentazocine did not compete for high-affinity binding. In vivo, a 2.5 mg/kg dose of (+)-pentazocine abolished11C-Me-NB1-specific binding, indicating an indirect effect of Sigma1R on11C-Me-NB1 binding.Conclusion:11C-Me-NB1 is suitable for the in vivo imaging of NMDA GluN1/GluN2B receptors and the assessment of receptor occupancy by NTD modulators.

Pharmacokinetic assessment of novel anti-cancer drugs using spectral analysis and positron emission tomography: a feasibility study,"S R Meikle, J C Matthews, C S Brock, P Wells, R J Harte, V J Cunningham, T Jones, P Price","Purpose: The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility of evaluating the pharmacokinetics of radiolabeled anti-cancer drugs using spectral analysis, a non-compartmental tracer kinetic modeling technique, and positron emission tomography (PET).

Methods: Dynamic PET studies were performed on patients receiving tracer doses of 5-fluorouracil (5-[18F]-FU) and two developmental drugs [11C]-temozolomide and [11C]-acridine carboxamide. Spectral analysis was then used to (a) determine individual and group average pharmacokinetics, (b) predict tumour handling in response to different drug administration regimens, and (c) produce functional parametric images describing regional pharmacokinetics.

Results: Spectral analysis could distinguish tumour kinetics from normal tissue kinetics in an individual [11C]-temozolomide study and demonstrated a markedly greater volume of distribution (VD) in glioma than in normal brain, although there was no appreciable difference in mean residence time. Analysis of pooled acridine carboxamide data (n = 22) revealed a relatively large VD (and prolonged retention) in the liver and spleen and a markedly lower VD (and initial uptake) in the brain. Continuous infusion of 5-[18F]-FU was predicted to achieve a concentration in colorectal metastases in liver approximately 10 times that achieved in plasma at 10 h after commencement of the infusion.

Conclusions: We conclude that spectral analysis provides important pharmacokinetic information about radiolabeled anti-cancer drugs with relatively few model assumptions.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9685053/
Design of Infusion Schemes for Neuroreceptor Imaging: Application to [(11)C]Flumazenil-PET Steady-State Study,"Ling Feng, Claus Svarer, Karine Madsen, Morten Ziebell, Agnete Dyssegaard, Anders Ettrup, Hanne Demant Hansen, Szabolcs Lehel, Stig Yndgaard, Olaf Bjarne Paulson, Gitte Moos Knudsen, Lars Hageman Pinborg","This study aims at developing a simulation system that predicts the optimal study design for attaining tracer steady-state conditions in brain and blood rapidly. Tracer kinetics was determined from bolus studies and used to construct the system. Subsequently, the system was used to design inputs for bolus infusion (BI) or programmed infusion (PI) experiments. Steady-state quantitative measurements can be made with one short scan and venous blood samples. The GABAA receptor ligand [(11)C]Flumazenil (FMZ) was chosen for this purpose, as it lacks a suitable reference region. Methods. Five bolus [(11)C]FMZ-PET scans were conducted, based on which population-based PI and BI schemes were designed and tested in five additional healthy subjects. The design of a PI was assisted by an offline feedback controller. Results. The system could reproduce the measurements in blood and brain. With PI, [(11)C]FMZ steady state was attained within 40 min, which was 8 min earlier than the optimal BI (B/I ratio = 55 min). Conclusions. The system can design both BI and PI schemes to attain steady state rapidly. For example, subjects can be [(11)C]FMZ-PET scanned after 40 min of tracer infusion for 40 min with venous sampling and a straight-forward quantification. This simulation toolbox is available for other PET-tracers.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27123457/
"Head-to-head comparison of (R)-[11C]verapamil and [18F]MC225 in non-human primates, tracers for measuring P-glycoprotein function","Lara García-Varela, David Vállez García, Pablo Aguiar, Takeharu Kakiuchi, Hiroyuki Ohba, Norihiro Harada, Shingo Nishiyama, Tetsuro Tago, Philip H Elsinga, Hideo Tsukada, Nicola A Colabufo, Rudi A J O Dierckx, Aren van Waarde, Jun Toyohara, Ronald Boellaard, Gert Luurtsema","Purpose: P-glycoprotein (P-gp) function is altered in several brain disorders; thus, it is of interest to monitor the P-gp function in vivo using PET. (R)-[11C]verapamil is considered the gold standard tracer to measure the P-gp function; however, it presents some drawbacks that limit its use. New P-gp tracers have been developed with improved properties, such as [18F]MC225. This study compares the characteristics of (R)-[11C]verapamil and [18F]MC225 in the same subjects.

Methods: Three non-human primates underwent 4 PET scans: 2 with (R)-[11C]verapamil and 2 with [18F]MC225, at baseline and after P-gp inhibition. The 30-min PET data were analyzed using 1-Tissue Compartment Model (1-TCM) and metabolite-corrected plasma as input function. Tracer kinetic parameters at baseline and after inhibition were compared. Regional differences and simplified methods to quantify the P-gp function were also assessed.

Results: At baseline, [18F]MC225 VTvalues were higher, and k2values were lower than those of (R)-[11C]verapamil, whereas K1values were not significantly different. After inhibition, VTvalues of the 2 tracers were similar; however, (R)-[11C]verapamil K1and k2values were higher than those of [18F]MC225. Significant regional differences between tracers were found at baseline, which disappeared after inhibition. The positive slope of the SUV-TAC was positively correlated to the K1and VTof both tracers.

Conclusion: [18F]MC225 and (R)-[11C]verapamil show comparable sensitivity to measure the P-gp function in non-human primates. Moreover, this study highlights the 30-min VTas the best parameter to measure decreases in the P-gp function with both tracers. [18F]MC225 may become the first radiofluorinated tracer able to measure decreases and increases in the P-gp function due to its higher baseline VT.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34117508/
The use of the exploratory IND in the evaluation and development of 18F-PET radiopharmaceuticals for amyloid imaging in the brain: a review of one company's experience,"A P Carpenter Jr, M J Pontecorvo, F F Hefti, D M Skovronsky","Aim and methods: The regulatory mechanism of exploratory INDs established in 2006 by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is useful for the evaluation of tracer dose radiopharmaceutical agents, and especially valuable for development of amyloid imaging agents because of the absence of appropriate animal models. The authors employed exploratory INDs to study four related novel 18F-labeled positron emission tomography (PET) amyloid imaging agents, 18F-AV-19, 18F-AV-45, 18F-AV-138 and 18F-AV-144. These exploratory INDs contained preclinical data on the mechanism of action, secondary pharmacology, biodistribution, pharmacokinetics and dosimetry and results from a single dose, extended acute toxicology study. Each compound was then tested in a human PET study in up to 15 healthy elderly controls (HC) and 15 patients with AD. Compared to HC, patients with AD showed accumulation of tracer in cortical areas expected to be high in amyloid deposition with all four tracer compounds, and no serious adverse events were observed for any of the tracers.

Results: .18F-AV-45 showed the best imaging characteristics and was chosen for further development under a traditional IND.

Conclusions: In summary the exploratory IND pathway was very useful for comparing four related agents with respect to efficacy (amyloid plaque binding), kinetics and dosimetry.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19834448/
Development and evaluation of compounds for imaging of beta-amyloid plaque by means of positron emission tomography,"Gjermund Henriksen, Behrooz H Yousefi, Alexander Drzezga, Hans-Jürgen Wester","Purpose: The proof of concept for in vivo targeting of beta-amyloid plaques (Abeta) in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) by means of nuclear imaging methods has been shown in recent clinical studies.

Methods: For positron emission tomography (PET), the five compounds [(11)C]PIB, 3'[(18)F]FPIB, [(18)F]FDDNP, [(11)C]SB-13 and [(18)F]F-SB-13 have been developed by a formal charge neutralisation of agents used for staining of AD brain post mortem.

Results: In AD-patients, these compounds have been shown to possess a selective uptake in the brain regions known to have a high Abeta-load. Progress towards tracers with proportionality between tracer uptake and quantity of Abeta-load, of use for longitudinal studies of AD patients, is addressed in the current development of Abeta-tracers.

Conclusion: Despite the extensive information on the structure-affinity relationship of several Abeta-binding compounds, data on the regional brain binding kinetics-beyond uptake in healthy rodents-have been obtained only for a few compounds. Recent results indicate that PET-imaging of Abeta-deposits in transgenic rodent models of AD is feasible which may be valuable for a more relevant preclinical evaluation of Abeta-tracers.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18224319/
Exploration of (R)-[11C]YH168 as a PET tracer for imaging monoacylglycerol lipase in the brain: from mice to non-human primates,"Yingfang He, MingQiang Zheng, Jiwei Gu, Lisa Reichert, Johannes Trimborn, Hui Zhang, Claudia Keller, Mallory Crosby, Ludovic Collin, Dominik Heer, Anto Pavlovic, Andreas Topp, Matthias Beat Wittwer, Uwe Grether, Luca Gobbi, Roger Schibli, Yiyun Huang, Linjing Mu","Purpose: The monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) plays a pivotal role in modulating the endocannabinoid system and is considered an attractive therapeutic target for diseases in both the central nervous system and periphery. The current study aimed to develop and evaluate a suitable carbon-11 labeled tracer for imaging MAGL in preclinical studies.

Methods: (R)-YH168 was synthesized via a multi-step pathway and its half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values were measured using an enzymatic assay. Radiosynthesis of (R)-[11C]YH168 was accomplished by11C-methylation via Suzuki cross-coupling of a pinacol boron precursor. In vitro autoradiography was performed using brain tissues from MAGL knockout and the corresponding wild-type mice. The metabolic stability of (R)-[11C]YH168 in mouse brain and plasma was assessed 5 min after injection. Dynamic PET scans were conducted on anesthetized mice and rhesus monkey. For studies in non-human primates, arterial blood samples were analyzed to obtain the input function for kinetic modeling. Blocking studies with the irreversible MAGL inhibitor PF-06795071 were performed to assess the binding specificity of (R)-[11C]YH168.

Results: (R)-[11C]YH168 was synthesized via Suzuki coupling of the phenyl boronic ester with [11C]CH3I in the presence of palladium catalyst. In vitro autoradiography revealed a heterogeneous distribution pattern of (R)-[11C]YH168 with higher binding to MAGL-rich brain regions in wild-type mouse brain slices compared to that of MAGL knockout mice. Dynamic PET imaging in wild-type and MAGL knockout mice confirmed its high specificity and selectivity in mouse brains. In the rhesus monkey, (R)-[11C]YH168 displayed good brain permeability. High levels of radioactivity uptake were seen in the cingulate cortex, frontal cortex, cerebellum, occipital cortex, and hippocampus, consistent with MAGL expression. The one-tissue compartment model was appropriate for fitting the regional time-activity curves and provided reliable volume of distribution values across all brain regions. Pretreatment with PF-06795071 (0.1 mg/kg) resulted in almost complete blockade (> 95%) of radioactivity uptake, demonstrating binding specificity of (R)-[11C]YH168 to MAGL in the non-human primate brain. The regional non-displaceable binding potential follows the rank order of cingulate cortex ~ frontal cortex ~ insula > putamen > temporal cortex > caudate ~ occipital cortex ~ thalamus > nucleus accumbens ~ hippocampus ~ cerebellum ~ globus pallidus > substantia nigra > amygdala.

Conclusion: (R)-[11C]YH168 is a promising PET probe for imaging and quantifying MAGL in the brains of mice and non-human primates. This11C-labeled tracer holds great potential for translation into human subjects and offers the possibility of performing multiple PET scans on the same subject within a single day.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39673602/
A technique for extracting physiological parameters and the required input function simultaneously from PET image measurements: theory and simulation study,"D Feng, K P Wong, C M Wu, W C Siu","Positron emission tomography (PET) is an important tool for enabling quantification of human brain function. However, quantitative studies using tracer kinetic modeling require the measurement of the tracer time-activity curve in plasma (PTAC) as the model input function. It is widely believed that the insertion of arterial lines and the subsequent collection and processing of the biomedical signal sampled from the arterial blood are not compatible with the practice of clinical PET, as it is invasive and exposes personnel to the risks associated with the handling of patient blood and radiation dose. Therefore, it is of interest to develop practical noninvasive measurement techniques for tracer kinetic modeling with PET. In this paper, a technique is proposed to extract the input function together with the physiological parameters from the brain dynamic images alone. The identifiability of this method is tested rigorously by using Monte Carlo simulation. The results show that the proposed method is able to quantify all the required parameters by using the information obtained from two or more regions of interest (ROI's) with very different dynamics in the PET dynamic images. There is no significant improvement in parameter estimation for the local cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (LCMRGlc) if the number of ROI's are more than three. The proposed method can provide very reliable estimation of LCMRGlc, which is our primary interest in this study.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11020827/

The enzyme natural turnoverα, relevant for drug development, can be estimated if a suicide inhibitor drug is used. The main aim of this study was to develop a model for estimatingαby accounting for the presence of residual inhibitor. We analyzed nonhuman primate PET data with monoacyglycerol lipase (MAGL) tracer [11C]PF-06809247, and suicide inhibitor PF-06818883 (0.03-1.27 mg/kg, active compound PF-06807893). As [11C]PF-06809247 is an irreversible tracer, we used simulations to evaluate the impact of flow limitation on identifiability of kinetic parameters. Based on this, MAGL activity estimates were obtained from three outcome parameters:Ki,k3,(=). A new model, which links enzyme activity to the inhibitor drug's plasma concentration, was used to estimateα. Using a conservative statistical cut-off, MAGL turnover half-lives were estimated (Ki: 3.9 h;k3: 4.6 h;: 6.1 h) - with faster turnover forKi(flow-limited). Serial PET experiments and measuring the drug's plasma concentration allowed to estimateαcorrecting for residual suicide inhibition. This approach can be extended to other PET enzyme targets, improving our understanding of enzyme pathological alterations and suicide inhibitor-based therapies.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40370302/

In this clinical study, we characterised the kinetic model best describing the uptake of18F-fluciclovine in breast cancer and assessed differences in tracer kinetics and static parameters for different breast cancer receptor subtypes and tumour grades.

Methods: Thirty-nine patients with pathologically proven breast cancer underwent 20-min dynamic PET/computed tomography imaging following the administration of18F-fluciclovine. Uptake into primary breast tumours was evaluated using one- and two-tissue reversible compartmental kinetic models and static parameters.

Results: A reversible one-tissue compartment model was shown to best describe tracer uptake in breast cancer. No significant differences were seen in kinetic or static parameters for different tumour receptor subtypes or grades. Kinetic and static parameters showed a good correlation.

Conclusions: 18F-fluciclovine has potential in the imaging of primary breast cancer, but kinetic analysis may not have additional value over static measures of tracer uptake.

Machine Learning-Based Noninvasive Quantification of Single-Imaging Session Dual-Tracer 18F-FDG and 68Ga-DOTATATE Dynamic PET-CT in Oncology,"Wenxiang Ding, Jiangyuan Yu, Chaojie Zheng, Peng Fu, Qiu Huang, David Dagan Feng, Zhi Yang, Richard L Wahl, Yun Zhou","68Ga-DOTATATE PET-CT is routinely used for imaging neuroendocrine tumor (NET) somatostatin receptor subtype 2 (SSTR2) density in patients, and is complementary to FDG PET-CT for improving the accuracy of NET detection, characterization, grading, staging, and predicting/monitoring NET responses to treatment. Performing sequential18F-FDG and68Ga-DOTATATE PET scans would require 2 or more days and can delay patient care. To align temporal and spatial measurements of18F-FDG and68Ga-DOTATATE PET, and to reduce scan time and CT radiation exposure to patients, we propose a single-imaging session dual-tracer dynamic PET acquisition protocol in the study. A recurrent extreme gradient boosting (rXGBoost) machine learning algorithm was proposed to separate the mixed18F-FDG and68Ga-DOTATATE time activity curves (TACs) for the region of interest (ROI) based quantification with tracer kinetic modeling. A conventional parallel multi-tracer compartment modeling method was also implemented for reference. Single-scan dual-tracer dynamic PET was simulated from 12 NET patient studies with18F-FDG and68Ga-DOTATATE 45-min dynamic PET scans separately obtained within 2 days. Our experimental results suggested an18F-FDG injection first followed by68Ga-DOTATATE with a minimum 5 min delayed injection protocol for the separation of mixed18F-FDG and68Ga-DOTATATE TACs using rXGBoost algorithm followed by tracer kinetic modeling is highly feasible.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34520350/
Radiochemical Synthesis and Evaluation of 3-[11C]Methyl-4-aminopyridine in Rodents and Nonhuman Primates for Imaging Potassium Channels in the CNS,"Yang Sun, Nicolas J Guehl, Yu-Peng Zhou, Kazue Takahashi, Vasily Belov, Maeva Dhaynaut, Sung-Hyun Moon, Georges El Fakhri, Marc D Normandin, Pedro Brugarolas","Demyelination, the loss of the insulating sheath of neurons, causes failed or slowed neuronal conduction and contributes to the neurological symptoms in multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain and spinal cord injuries, stroke, and dementia. In demyelinated neurons, the axonal potassium channels Kv1.1 and Kv1.2, generally under the myelin sheath, become exposed and upregulated. Therefore, imaging these channels using positron emission tomography can provide valuable information for disease diagnosis and monitoring. Here, we describe a novel tracer for Kv1 channels, [11C]3-methyl-4-aminopyridine ([11C]3Me4AP). [11C]3Me4AP was efficiently synthesized via Pd(0)-Cu(I) comediated Stille cross-coupling of a stannyl precursor containing a free amino group. Evaluation of its imaging properties in rats and nonhuman primates showed that [11C]3Me4AP has a moderate brain permeability and slow kinetics. Additional evaluation in monkeys showed that the tracer is metabolically stable and that a one-tissue compartment model can accurately model the regional brain time-activity curves. Compared to the related tracers [18F]3-fluoro-4-aminopyridine ([18F]3F4AP) and [11C]3-methoxy-4-aminopyridine ([11C]3MeO4AP), [11C]3Me4AP shows lower initial brain uptake, which indicates reduced permeability to the blood-brain barrier and slower kinetics, suggesting higher binding affinity consistent within vitrostudies. While the slow kinetics and strong binding affinity resulted in a tracer with less favorable properties for imaging the brain than its predecessors, these properties may make 3Me4AP useful as a therapeutic.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36417797/
The value of quantitative myocardial perfusion imaging with positron emission tomography in coronary artery disease,"W Wijns, P G Camici","Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is the only available technique that permits quantification of regional myocardial perfusion in humans. To this end, tracer kinetic models and appropriate tracers such as 13N-Ammonia and 15O labeled water are required. Quantification is possible because accurate radioactivity quantities can be measured externally, both for the vascular and myocardial compartments. Normal value for baseline and maximal perfusion after pharmacologically induced vasodilatation of the resistance microcirculatory vessels are age-dependent. The functional hemodynamic significance of epicardial stenoses can be estimated from the progressive reduction in coronary perfusion reserve, which decreases progressively when stenosis severity reaches 40% in diameter. The effect of revascularization procedures such as CABG and PTCA can be objectively measured. In addition, there is increasing evidence from PET studies that resistive vessel dysfunction (probably through endothelial factors) contributes to the reduced perfusion reserve in patients with epicardial coronary artery disease. Therefore quantification of myocardial perfusion with PET appears an ideally suited endpoint for primary and secondary prevention trials.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9134442/
Quantitative studies using positron emission tomography (PET) for the diagnosis and therapy planning of oncological patients,"Antonia Dimitrakopoulou-Strauss, Ludwig Strauss","Positron emission tomography (PET) has found wide-spread use in oncology due to the relatively high accuracy in the staging, differential diagnosis and therapy monitoring. Most PET studies are performed as a whole body scan. In selected cases a semiquantitative analysis is performed, which is based on the calculation of standardized uptake values (SUV). The present studies were undertaken in order to evaluate the impact of dynamic PET studies in malignant diseases with respect to tumor diagnosis and therapy management. Dynamic data acquisition is superior to static images because is provides information about the tracer distribution with respect of time and space, in a region of interest. The impact of different compartmental and non-compartmental approaches for the diagnostics and therapy planning was also studied. The radiopharmaceuticals used for patient studies were: O-15-water, C-11-ethanol, F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), F-18-fluorouracil (F-18-FU), and 6-F-18-fluoro-L-DOPA. A new evaluation strategy of dynamic PET studies based on an integrated evaluation including both compartment and non-compartment models as well as the use of SUV is presented. Furthermore, the parametric imaging including Fourier-analysis and regressions analysis was used.

Results: PET-studies with labeled cytostatic agents provide informations about the transport and elimination of a cytostatic agent and help to predict the therapeutic outcome. The retention of the radiolabeled cytostatic agent F-18-FU in liver metastases of colorectal cancer was low after systemic application. Lesions with retention values >3.0 SUV and with <2.0 SUV correlated with negative and positive growth rates, respectively. A high F-18-FU retention (>2.96 SUV) was associated with longer survival times (>21 months). In contrast, patients with lower F-18-FU retention values (<1.2 SUV) survived no longer than one year. A higher diagnostic accuracy was obtained by using an integrated evaluation including both compartment and non-compartment models. (18)F-FDG studies for the diagnosis of soft tissue sarcomas showed a sensitivity and specificity of 91% and 88% for the primary tumors and 88% and 92% for the recurrences, respectively. Using a combination of SUV and transport rates, it was possible to further classify malignant soft tissue tumors with regard to tumor grading percentages of 84% of the G III, 37.5% of the G II, 80% of the G I tumors, as well as 50% of the lipomas and 14.3% of scar tissue were correctly classified using the integrated evaluation. In patients with bone tumors, integrated evaluation was also superior to SUV or visual evaluation leading to a sensitivity of 76% (for SUV: 54%), a specificity of 97% (for SUV: 91%) and an accuracy of 88% (for SUV: 75%). The diagnostic efficacy of SUV and of the fractal dimension of the time activity data of FDG was evaluated in 159 patients with 200 lesions of different tumors with respect to differential diagnosis and the prognosis of therapeutic outcome. Discriminant analysis revealed a diagnostic accuracy of 76.65% for all patients, 67.7% for the untreated group of patients and 83.44% for the pretreated patients. The advantage of parametric imaging is the visualization of one isolated parameter of the tracer s kinetic, like the phosphorylation in case of (18)F-FDG. Furthermore, the delineation of a tumor is better due to the absence of background activity. The presented data also demonstrate that parametric imaging based on Fourier transformation may be useful for the evaluation of the pharmacokinetics and effectiveness of regional therapeutic procedures. In conclusion, a semiquantitative analysis of PET data sets based on SUV is in general helpful and should be performed under standardized conditions, concerning the time after tracer application, the blood glucose level in case of (18)F-FDG, partial volume correction and the choice of reconstruction parameters. The combination of two SUV s, an early and a late one is a simple and usefull approach for the evaluation of a dynamic series in a clinical environment. PET studies with labeled cytostatic agents provide information about the transport and elimination of a cytostatic agent and help to predict the therapeutic outcome. Non-compartment models require further evaluation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16617388/
In Vivo Evaluation of 11C-Preladenant for PET Imaging of Adenosine A2A Receptors in the Conscious Monkey,"Xiaoyun Zhou, Ronald Boellaard, Kiichi Ishiwata, Muneyuki Sakata, Rudi A J O Dierckx, Johan R de Jong, Shingo Nishiyama, Hiroyuki Ohba, Hideo Tsukada, Erik F J de Vries, Philip H Elsinga","11C-preladenant was developed as a novel PET ligand for the adenosine A2Areceptors (A2ARs). The present study aimed to evaluate the suitability of11C-preladenant PET for the quantification of striatal A2ARs and the assessment of A2AR occupancy in the conscious monkey brain.Methods:11C-preladenant was intravenously injected into conscious monkeys (n= 4, 18 PET scans), and a 91-min dynamic scan was started. Arterial blood samples in combination with metabolite analysis were obtained during the scan to provide the input function for kinetic modeling. The distribution volume (VT) was obtained by kinetic modeling with a 2-tissue-compartment model. The simplified reference tissue model (SRTM) with selected reference regions (cerebellum, cingulate, parietal cortex, and occipital cortex) was tested to estimate the binding potential (BPND) in A2AR-rich regions.BPNDobtained from the SRTM was compared with distribution volume ratio (DVR)-1. The effects of blood volume, blood delay, and scan duration onBPNDand DVR-1 were investigated.VTandBPNDwere also obtained after preblocking with unlabeled preladenant (1 mg/kg), A2AR-selective KW-6002 (0.5-1 mg/kg), and nonselective adenosine receptor antagonist caffeine (2.5-10 mg/kg). A2AR occupancy was studied with caffeine blockade.Results:Regional uptake of11C-preladenant was consistent with the distribution of A2ARs in the monkey brain, with the highest uptake in the putamen, followed by the caudate, and the lowest uptake in the cerebellum. Tracer kinetics were well described by the 2-tissue-compartment model with a lower constraint onk4to stabilize fits. The highestVTwas observed in A2AR-rich regions (∼5.8-7.4) and lowest value in the cerebellum (∼1.3).BPNDvalues estimated from the SRTM with different scan durations were comparable and were in agreement with DVR-1 (∼4.3-5.3 in A2AR-rich regions). Preladenant preinjection decreased the tracer uptake in A2AR-rich regions to the level of the reference regions. Caffeine pretreatment reduced the tracer uptake in the striatum in a dose-dependent manner.Conclusion:11C-preladenant PET is suitable for noninvasive quantification of A2ARs and assessment of A2AR occupancy in A2AR-rich regions in the monkey brain. SRTM using the cerebellum as the reference tissue is the applicable model for A2AR quantification.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28062599/
Quantification of brain oxygen extraction and metabolism with [15O]-gas PET: A technical review in the era of PET/MRI,"Audrey P Fan, Hongyu An, Farshad Moradi, Jarrett Rosenberg, Yosuke Ishii, Tadashi Nariai, Hidehiko Okazawa, Greg Zaharchuk","Oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) and the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) are key cerebral physiological parameters to identify at-risk cerebrovascular patients and understand brain health and function. PET imaging with [15O]-oxygen tracers, either through continuous or bolus inhalation, provides non-invasive assessment of OEF and CMRO2. Numerous tracer delivery, PET acquisition, and kinetic modeling approaches have been adopted to map brain oxygenation. The purpose of this technical review is to critically evaluate different methods for [15O]-gas PET and its impact on the accuracy and reproducibility of OEF and CMRO2measurements. We perform a meta-analysis of brain oxygenation PET studies in healthy volunteers and compare between continuous and bolus inhalation techniques. We also describe OEF metrics that have been used to detect hemodynamic impairment in cerebrovascular disease. For these patients, advanced techniques to accelerate the PET scans and potential synthesis with MRI to avoid arterial blood sampling would facilitate broader use of [15O]-oxygen PET for brain physiological assessment.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32634594/
Validity of PET studies in brain tumors,"K Herholz, K Wienhard, W D Heiss","Positron emission tomography (PET) in human brain tumors presents specific problems, such as tissue inhomogeneity and disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), that are not present or at least not that important in normal brain. In addition, tracer metabolism may be different from normal brain. Mathematical arguments demonstrate that quantitation in inhomogeneous tissue is extremely difficult with tracers undergoing reversible metabolism, whereas irreversible metabolic steps can be quantified more easily. Even for metabolically inert tracers with reversible transport across the BBB, physiological identification of transport rate constants may be ambiguous, since diffusion processes within the tissue cannot be differentiated from slow transport components at the BBB. Mathematical analysis shows that transport is usually underestimated, whereas metabolism is usually overestimated in inhomogeneous tumor tissue. For accurate measurements of blood flow and BBB permeability, use of short measurement times is recommended. Measurements of tumor glucose consumption with [18F]2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) are probably only little affected by tumor heterogeneity. There are, however, major problems caused by variation of the lumped constant, which relates the kinetics of FDG to those of glucose. Most experimental data indicate a considerable increase of the lumped constant in malignant tumors, resulting in overestimation of glucose metabolism if the standard value is used. In spite of these limitations, measurements of glucose metabolism with FDG are useful clinically to evaluate the prognosis of patients with brain tumors and to differentiate between late radiation necrosis and recurrent tumor. New tracers for measurement of protein synthesis, cell proliferation, and uptake of cytostatic drugs are of high clinical interest. As yet, little is known about the contribution of metabolites in brain and plasma to measured tissue activity, and differentiation between transport at the BBB and metabolism may be difficult. Therefore, the basis for accurate quantitation with these new compounds is still incomplete. Clinical reports suggest that some amino acid tracers can be used for localization and grading of brain tumors.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2121212/
Pharmacokinetics of radiolabelled anticancer drugs for positron emission tomography,"O Clyde Hutchinson, David R Collingridge, Henryk Barthel, Pat M Price, Eric O Aboagye","Positron emission tomography (PET) provides the oncologist with information on tumour diagnosis, and treatment response monitoring.

Quantitative metrics of net proliferation and invasion link biological aggressiveness assessed by MRI with hypoxia assessed by FMISO-PET in newly diagnosed glioblastomas,"Mindy D Szeto, Gargi Chakraborty, Jennifer Hadley, Russ Rockne, Mark Muzi, Ellsworth C Alvord Jr, Kenneth A Krohn, Alexander M Spence, Kristin R Swanson","Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) are aggressive and uniformly fatal primary brain tumors characterized by their diffuse invasion of the normal-appearing parenchyma peripheral to the clinical imaging abnormality. Hypoxia, a hallmark of aggressive tumor behavior often noted in GBMs, has been associated with resistance to therapy, poorer survival, and more malignant tumor phenotypes. Based on the existence of a set of novel imaging techniques and modeling tools, our objective was to assess a hypothesized quantitative link between tumor growth kinetics [assessed via mathematical models and routine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)] and the hypoxic burden of the tumor [assessed via positron emission tomography (PET) imaging]. Our biomathematical model for glioma kinetics describes the spatial and temporal evolution of a glioma in terms of concentration of malignant tumor cells. This model has already been proven useful as a novel tool to dynamically quantify the net rates of proliferation (rho) and invasion (D) of the glioma cells in individual patients. Estimates of these kinetic rates can be calculated from routinely available pretreatment MRI in vivo. Eleven adults with GBM were imaged preoperatively with (18)F-fluoromisonidazole (FMISO)-PET and serial gadolinium-enhanced T1- and T2-weighted MRIs to allow the estimation of patient-specific net rates of proliferation (rho) and invasion (D). Hypoxic volumes were quantified from each FMISO-PET scan following standard techniques. To control for tumor size variability, two measures of hypoxic burden were considered: relative hypoxia (RH), defined as the ratio of the hypoxic volume to the T2-defined tumor volume, and the mean intensity on FMISO-PET scaled to the blood activity of the tracer (mean T/B). Pearson correlations between RH and the net rate of cell proliferation (rho) reached significance (P < 0.04). Moreover, highly significant positive correlations were found between biological aggressiveness ratio (rho/D) and both RH (P < 0.00003) and the mean T/B (P < 0.0007).",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19366800/
Wavelet analysis of dynamic PET data: application to the parametric imaging of benzodiazepine receptor concentration,"P Millet, V Ibáñez, J Delforge, S Pappata, J Guimón","Receptor density and ligand affinity can be assessed using positron emission tomography (PET). Biological parameters (B(max)('), k(1), k(2), k(on)/V(R), k(off)) are estimated using a compartmental model and a multi-injection protocol. Parametric imaging of the ligand-receptor model has been shown to be of special interest to study certain brain disorders. However, the low signal-to-noise ratio in kinetic curves at the pixel level hampers an adequate estimation of model parameters during the optimization procedure. For this reason, mapping requires a spatial filter, resulting in a loss of resolution. Filtering the kinetic curves in the frequency domain using the Fourier transform is not appropriate, because of difficulties in choosing a correct and efficient cutoff frequency. A wavelet-based filter is more appropriate to such tracer kinetics. The purpose of this study is to build up parametric images at the pixel level while conserving the original spatial resolution, using wavelet-based filtering. Data from [(11)C]flumazenil studies, mapping the benzodiazepine receptor density, were used. An invertible discrete wavelet transform was used to calculate the time-frequency signals of the time-concentration PET curves on a pixel-by-pixel basis. Kinetic curves observed from large regions of interest in high and low receptor-density regions were used to calibrate the threshold of wavelet coefficients. The shrunken wavelet coefficients were then transformed back to the original domain in order to obtain the filtered PET signal. Maps of all binding parameters were obtained at the pixel level with acceptable coefficients of variation of less than 30% for the B(max)(') parameter in most of the gray matter. A strong correlation between model parameter estimates using the usual regions of interest and parametric imaging was observed for all model parameters (r = 0.949 for the parameter B(max)(')). We conclude that wavelet-based filters are useful for building binding parameter maps without loss of the original spatial resolution of the PET scanner. The use of the wavelet-based filtering method can be extended far beyond the multi-injection protocol. It is likely to be also effective for other dynamic PET studies.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10806032/
PET Measurement of rCBF in the presence of a neurochemical tracer,"Alexander K Converse, Todd E Barnhart, Kevin A Dabbs, Onofre T DeJesus, Julie A Larson, Robert J Nickles, Mary L Schneider, Andrew D Roberts","Functional neurochemical imaging can indicate neurotransmitter release by detecting changes in receptor occupancy. A dual tracer positron emission tomography (PET) technique is presented here to extend such studies by simultaneously measuring changes in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF). This would permit correlations of task or drug induced changes in rCBF and neurochemical function. In this proposed method, the rapidly varying signal from a blood flow tracer is distinguished from the slowly changing signal due to a long-lived neurochemical tracer. As a proof of principle, baseline studies were carried out in rhesus monkeys. Two monkeys were anesthetized with isoflurane, and [18F]fallypride (t1/2=110 min), a dopamine D2 receptor antagonist, was injected. Starting 99-137 min after injection, PET images were acquired every 10 s while the blood flow tracer [17F]fluoromethane (t1/2=65 s) was administered by inhalation in a repeating pattern of 45 s on/45 s off. The observed time-activity curves for 2 ml brain regions were fit with a three compartment lung-body-brain model of fluoromethane kinetics with whole brain perfusion fixed. Comparing consecutive 6 min scans, reproducibility of relative rCBF and striatal [18F]fallypride concentration were 9 and 8%, respectively.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14706718/

In BNCT, 4-borono-2-[18F]-fluoro-L-phenylalanine (18F-FBPA) PET has been employed to estimate10B accumulation in target tumors and normal tissues if10B borono-L-phenylalanine (10B-BPA) is used as a boron carrier. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the total distribution volume (Vt) of18F-FBPA in normal organs of healthy volunteers by kinetic analysis and to estimate boron concentration in normal organs for the therapeutic dose of10B-BPA using obtained Vt values.

Methods: Six healthy volunteers were injected with18F-FBPA (3-5 MBq/kg), and 7 PET-CT scans were performed subsequently.18F-FBPA radioactivity in whole blood and plasma was measured before, and eight times after the injection. PET images were analyzed by PMOD software. Twelve volumetric regions of interest including the brain, heart, right lung, spleen, liver, parotid salivary glands, esophagus, stomach, pancreas, intestines, and bone marrow were drawn manually for each subject and analyzed with the Logan plot and two Ichise multilinear analyses (MA1 and MA2). The better model was defined by several goodness-of-fit parameters and residual distribution. After Vt values had been derived, boron concentration was estimated in ppm for the10B-BPA-fructose (10B-BPA-fr) dose 30 g 1 and 2 h post-injection using Vt and interpolated plasma activity data.

Results: The Ichise MA2 model showed the best fit among all models. Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) was the lowest for the Ichise's MA2 in all regions (mean AIC value - 14.0) comparing to the other models (Logan plot mean AIC 31.4; Ichise MA1 model mean AIC - 4.2). Mean Vt values of the Ichise MA2 model ranged from 0.94 ± 0.14 ml/ml in the pancreas to 0.16 ± 0.02 ml/ml in the right lung. Estimated boron concentration for10B-BPA-fr had the highest value in the pancreas (14.0 ± 1.9 ppm 1 h after, and 5.7 ± 1.7 ppm 2 h after the18F-FBPA administration) and the lowest value in the right lung (2.4 ± 0.3 ppm 1 h, and 1.0 ± 0.3 ppm 2 h post-injection).

Conclusion: The10B concentration in normal tissues was best estimated using Vt values of18F-FBPA with the Ichise multilinear analysis 2 (MA2).

Comparison of the pharmacokinetics of 68Ga-DOTATOC and [18F]FDG in patients with metastatic neuroendocrine tumours scheduled for 90Y-DOTATOC therapy,"Sophia Koukouraki, Ludwig G Strauss, Vassilios Georgoulias, Michael Eisenhut, Uwe Haberkorn, Antonia Dimitrakopoulou-Strauss","Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare, by means of dynamic PET, the pharmacokinetics of 68Ga-DOTATOC, a tracer which reflects the expression of somatostatin receptors (SSTRs), and of [18F]FDG, a marker of tumour viability, in patients with metastatic neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) in whom 90Y-DOTATOC therapy was planned.

Materials and methods: Fifteen patients (63 lesions) with confirmed metastatic NETs were enrolled in this study. Dynamic [18F]FDG and 68Ga-DOTATOC PET scans were performed on two different days in the same week. The data analysis was based on qualitative and quantitative analysis using a two-tissue compartment model with a blood compartment and a non-compartment model based on the fractal dimension (FD). Multivariate analysis was used for evaluation of the kinetic data.

Results: Enhanced [18F]FDG uptake was observed in 43/63 lesions. 68Ga-DOTATOC showed pathologically enhanced uptake in all evaluated patients and in 57/63 lesions. Discordant scintigraphic results for [18F]FDG and 68Ga-DOTATOC were observed in 6/15 patients. Global SUV was defined as the SUV measured in the last frame (55-60 min p.i.) of the dynamic series, for each tracer. The median global SUV uptake was 7.9 for 68Ga-DOTATOC and 4.6 for [18F]FDG. The selection of patients for 90Y-DOTATOC therapy was based on the uptake of 68Ga-DOTATOC. Multiple linear regression analysis was applied to determine the effect of each kinetic parameter (K1-k4, VB) on the global SUV of both tracers. The highest positive t-ratio was found for K1 (receptor binding), followed by k3 (cellular internalisation) and VB (fractional blood volume), when using the global 68Ga-DOTATOC uptake (SUV) as a target variable. Analysis of the [18F]FDG data revealed the highest positive t-ratio for VB, followed by k3 (phosphorylation) and K1 (influx). The comparison of global SUV, K1-k4 and the FD for [18F]FDG and 68Ga-DOTATOC did not show any statistically significant correlation. The only parameter that demonstrated a significant linear correlation between the tracers was VB.

Conclusion: 68Ga-DOTATOC is a promising tool for evaluation of the expression of SSTR2 in NETs. The combination of [18F]FDG and 68Ga-DOTATOC dynamic PET studies provides different information regarding the biological properties of lesions in patients with metastatic NETs in whom 90Y-DOTATOC therapy is planned. While the global 68Ga-DOTATOC uptake is influenced mostly by K1, the global [18F]FDG uptake is mostly influenced by VB. Only patients with enhanced 68Ga-DOTATOC uptake (SUV >5.0) were referred to 90Y-DOTATOC therapy.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16763820/
Rabbit myocardial 82Rb kinetics and a compartmental model for blood flow estimation,"S C Huang, B A Williams, J Krivokapich, L Araujo, M E Phelps, H R Schelbert","Quantification of regional myocardial blood flow (MBF) with rubidium-82 (82Rb) and positron emission tomography (PET) requires the validation of a tracer kinetic model that adequately describes the kinetics of 82Rb in tissue. We performed 134 82Rb kinetic experiments in 24 isolated, arterially perfused rabbit interventricular septa at different flow rates (0.5-4.5 ml.min-1.g-1) and under the following conditions: varied concentrations of glucose (2.8-11 mM), insulin (0-5 mU/ml), and potassium (5-8 mM); varied pH (7.2-7.8); varied workload; and the addition of acetylstrophanthidin (1.0 microM). The measured 82Rb tissue time-activity curves consisted of two exponential components, with half times inversely related to MBF. The size of the slow component decreased as MBF increased (from 70% at 0.3 ml.min-1.g-1 to 30% at 2.0 ml. min-1.g-1). The kinetics were not strongly dependent on the conditions studied and were consistent with a compartmental model containing two communicating compartments. The volume of the fast exchangeable compartment and the transport rate constant from the fast to the slow compartment were found to be independent of MBF. Values of MBF were estimated with the compartmental model from 82Rb kinetics, and they correlated well with the directly measured MBF (r = 0.91; slope = 1.03).",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2784945/
Decrease in cortical benzodiazepine receptors in symptomatic patients with leukoaraiosis: a positron emission tomography study,"M Ihara, H Tomimoto, K Ishizu, T Mukai, H Yoshida, N Sawamoto, M Inoue, T Doi, K Hashikawa, J Konishi, H Shibasaki, H Fukuyama","Background and purpose: [11C]flumazenil (FMZ), a ligand that selectively binds to the central benzodiazepine receptor in the neuronal membrane, is useful for evaluating neuronal viability in a positron emission tomography (PET) scan. Using this ligand, we investigated whether there was a correlation between neuronal integrity in various brain structures and dementia in patients with leukoaraiosis.

Methods: Twelve patients with extensive leukoaraiosis on magnetic resonance imaging were divided into groups of patients with or without dementia. Based on a 2-compartment, 2-parameter model that included metabolite-corrected arterial input and PET-measured cerebral radioactivity, the distribution volume of FMZ (FMZ-V(d)) was calculated in various regions of interest by nonlinear curve fitting. Additionally, tracer kinetic analysis was applied for voxel-by-voxel quantification of FMZ-V(d), and data analysis was performed by statistical parametric mapping.

Results: The presence of dementia was associated with a reduced FMZ-V(d) in widespread areas of the cerebral cortex, including the bilateral frontopolar and frontal/insular areas, the left temporo-occipital border areas, and the left marginal cortical areas.

Conclusions: Differences in neuronal integrity in the cerebral cortex might determine whether patients with leukoaraiosis become symptomatic or not.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15001785/
Modeling of carbon-11-acetate kinetics by simultaneously fitting data from multiple ROIs coupled by common parameters,"R R Raylman, G D Hutchins, R S Beanlands, M Schwaiger","One of the unique aspects of PET is its ability to noninvasively quantify metabolic processes. Metabolic rate parameters are estimated by fitting the time-activity curves from regions of interest (ROIs) placed on dynamic PET images with a kinetic model. In many cases it is possible to couple these datasets with common parameters, such as the time delay between arrival of tracer in the ROIs and the sampling site.

Methods: Data from eight ROIs placed about images of the myocardium were coupled by the parameters describing the metabolite concentration in the blood. The method was evaluated by comparing estimates of k2 made using the coupled region method and the standard process of fitting data from each region separately. In addition, comparisons were made between estimates of k2 and measured myocardial oxygen consumption.

Results: Very little change in mean values of k2 was obtained. The variances, however, were reduced by an average of 37%, compared to the standard method, when the common parameters were not constrained. When the values of the common metabolite parameters were constrained to values previously measured, the average variance in estimates of k2 was reduced by 30%.

Conclusion: We have demonstrated that the use of this technique can significantly increase the precision of estimates of myocardial oxygen consumption utilizing 11C-acetate PET images. More precise estimates of such quantities can facilitate detection of small regional and/or temporal physiological changes measured with PET. Furthermore, this method can be utilized whenever it is known a priori that one or more kinetic model parameters has the same value for every set of ROI data.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8046480/

In this study, we aimed to recover sub-optimal input functions by using information from the tail (5th-100th min) of curves obtained through the frequent sampling protocol and an input recovery (IR) model trained with reference curves of optimal shape. Initially, we included 170 plasma input curves from eight published studies with clamp [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose PET exams. Model validation involved 78 brain PET studies for which compartmental model (CM) analysis was feasible (reference (ref) + training sets). Recovered curves were compared with original curves using area under curve (AUC), max peak standardized uptake value (maxSUV). CM parameters (ref + training sets) and fractional uptake rate (FUR) (all sets) were computed. Original and recovered curves from the ref set had comparable AUC (d = 0.02, not significant (NS)), maxSUV (d = 0.05, NS) and comparable brain CM results (NS). Recovered curves from the training set were different from the original according to maxSUV (d = 3) and biologically plausible according to the max theoretical K1 (53//56). Brain CM results were different in the training set (p< 0.05 for all CM parameters and brain regions) but not in the ref set. FUR showed reductions similarly in the recovered curves of the training and test sets compared to the original curves (p< 0.05 for all regions for both sets). The IR method successfully recovered the plasma inputs of poor quality, rescuing cases otherwise excluded from the kinetic modeling results. The validation approach proved useful and can be applied to different tracers and metabolic conditions.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38393006/

Aim of this work was the simultaneous production of two PET-tracers in one module and test the relevance for human application. [11C]harmine and [11C]DASB were concurrently synthesized in a 'two-in-one-pot' reaction in quality for application. Dual-tracer protocol was simulated using 16 single PET scans in different orders of tracer application separated by different time intervals. Volume of distribution was calculated for single- and dual-tracer measurements using Logan's plot and arterial input function in 13 brain regions. The 'two-in-one-pot' reaction yielded equivalent amounts of both radiotracers with comparable molar activities. The simulations of the dual-tracer application were comparable to the single bolus injections in 13 brain regions, when [11C]harmine was applied first and [11C]DASB second, with an injection time interval of 45 min (rxy= 0.90). Our study shows the successful simultaneous dual-tracer production leading to decreased radiation burden and costs. The simulation of dual subject injection to quantify the monoamine oxidase-A and serotonin transporter distribution proved its high potential.

First-pass contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CE-MRI) using gadolinium (Gd)-DTPA as a contrast agent (CA) has been used to assess MPR. Tracer kinetic models based on compartmental analysis of the CA uptake have been developed to provide quantitative measures of MBF by MRI. To study the accuracy of Gd-DTPA first-pass MRI and kinetic modeling for quantitative analysis of myocardial perfusion and MPR during dipyridamole infusion, we conducted a comparison with positron emission tomography (PET) in 18 healthy males (age = 40 +/- 14 years). Five planes were acquired at every second heartbeat with a 1.5T scanner using a saturation recovery turboFLASH sequence. A perfusion-related parameter, the unidirectional influx constant (Ki), was computed in three coronary artery territories. There was a significant correlation for both dipyridamole-induced flow (0.70, P = 0.001) and MPR (0.48, P = 0.04) between MRI and PET. However, we noticed that MRI provided lower MPR values compared to PET (2.5 +/- 1.0 vs. 4.3 +/- 1.8).

Activation of cerebral A1Rs acts as a brake on the microglial response after traumatic brain injury and has neuroprotective properties in animal models of Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis. Neuroinflammatory processes in turn may affect the expression of A1Rs, but the available data is limited and inconsistent. Here, we applied an animal model of encephalitis to assess how neuroinflammation affects the expression of A1Rs. Two groups of animals were studied: Infected rats (n=7) were intranasally inoculated with herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1, 1 × 10(7) plaque forming units), sham-infected rats (n=6) received only phosphate-buffered saline. Six or seven days later, microPET scans (60 min with arterial blood sampling) were made using the tracer 8-dicyclopropyl-1-(11)C-methyl-3-propyl-xanthine ((11)C-MPDX). Tracer clearance from plasma and partition coefficient (K₁/k₂ estimated from a 2-tissue compartment model fit) were not significantly altered after virus infection. PET tracer distribution volume calculated from a Logan plot was significantly increased in the hippocampus (+37%) and medulla (+27%) of virus infected rats. Tracer binding potential (k₃/k₄ estimated from the model fit) was significantly increased in the cerebellum (+87%) and the medulla (+148%) which may indicate increased A1R expression. This was confirmed by immunohistochemical analysis showing a strong increase of A1R immunoreactivity in the cerebellum of HSV-1-infected rats. Both the quantitative PET data and immunohistochemical analysis indicate that A1Rs are upregulated in brain areas where active virus is present.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24513151/
Continuous Blood Sampling in Small Animal Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography Enables the Measurement of the Arterial Input Function,"Teresa Mann, Jens Kurth, Anne Möller, Joanna Förster, Brigitte Vollmar, Bernd J Krause, Andreas Wree, Jan Stenzel, Tobias Lindner","For quantitative analysis and bio-kinetic modeling of positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) data, the determination of the temporal blood time-activity concentration also known as arterial input function (AIF) is a key point, especially for the characterization of animal disease models and the introduction of newly developed radiotracers. The knowledge of radiotracer availability in the blood helps to interpret PET/CT-derived data of tissue activity. For this purpose, online blood sampling during the PET/CT imaging is advisable to measure the AIF. In contrast to manual blood sampling and image-derived approaches, continuous online blood sampling has several advantages. Besides the minimized blood loss, there is an improved resolution and a superior accuracy for the blood activity measurement. However, the major drawback of online blood sampling is the costly and time-consuming preparation to catheterize the femoral vessels of the animal. Here, we describe an easy and complete workflow for catheterization and continuous blood sampling during small animal PET/CT imaging and compared it to manual blood sampling and an image-derived approach. Using this highly-standardized workflow, the determination of the fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]FDG) AIF is demonstrated. Further, this procedure can be applied to any radiotracer in combination with different animal models to create fundamental knowledge of tracer kinetic and model characteristics. This allows a more precise evaluation of the behavior of pharmaceuticals, both for diagnostic and therapeutic approaches in the preclinical research of oncological, neurodegenerative and myocardial diseases.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31449263/

Accurate DIL identification may enable more accurate diagnosis and therapy through more precise targeting of biopsy, radiotherapy and focal ablative therapies. The goal of this study is to validate the performance of [18F]DCFPyL PET and CT perfusion (CTP) for detecting and localizing DIL against digital histopathological images.

Methods: Multi-modality image sets: in vivo T2-weighted (T2w)-MRI, 22-min dynamic [18F]DCFPyL PET/CT, CTP, and 2-h post-injection PET/MR were acquired in patients prior to radical prostatectomy. The explanted gland with implanted fiducial markers was imaged with T2w-MRI. All images were co-registered to the pathologist-annotated digital images of whole-mount mid-gland histology sections using fiducial markers and anatomical landmarks. Regions of interest encompassing DIL and non-DIL tissue were drawn on the digital histopathological images and superimposed on PET and CTP parametric maps. Logistic regression with backward elimination of parameters was used to select the most sensitive parameter set to distinguish DIL from non-DIL voxels. Leave-one-patient-out cross-validation was performed to determine diagnostic performance.

Results: [18F]DCFPyL PET and CTP parametric maps of 15 patients were analyzed. SUVLateand a model combining Kiand k4of [18F]DCFPyL achieved the most accurate performance distinguishing DIL from non-DIL voxels. Both detection models achieved an AUC of 0.90 and an error rate of < 10%. Compared to digital histopathology, the detected DILs had a mean dice similarity coefficient of 0.8 for the Kiand k4model and 0.7 for SUVLate.

Conclusions: We have validated using co-registered digital histopathological images that parameters from kinetic analysis of 22-min dynamic [18F]DCFPyL PET can accurately localize DILs in PCa for targeting of biopsy, radiotherapy, and focal ablative therapies. Short-duration dynamic [18F]DCFPyL PET was not inferior to SUVLatein this diagnostic task.

The goal of this study is to determine the optimal imaging protocols and parameters using a realistic simulation study. The time activity curves (TACs) of different tissue organs from a 30-s infusion time (IT) of18F-flurpiridaz in a dynamic PET study were extracted from a previous study. The TACs at different time points were incorporated in a series of realistic 3D XCAT phantoms from which the parameters of a 2-compartment model and the 'true' MBF of18F-flurpiridaz were determined. The compartmental model was used to generate TACs from 7 additional ITs. PET projection data from the XCAT phantoms were generated using Monte Carlo simulation. They were reconstructed using an OS-EM reconstruction algorithm with different update number (N) to obtain dynamic PET images. The blood and myocardial TACs were derived from the dynamic images from which the MBF and %MBF error was estimated. The %MBF error decreases with increasing N of the OS-EM and levels off after ∼42. The 30-s IT gave the smallest %MBF error that decreases from ∼0.57% to ∼19.40%. The MBF for 2-min, 4-min, 8-min and 16-min IT were statistically significant different from the MBF for 30-s IT (P<0.05). Too fast or too slow infusion time gave higher %MBF error.

Dual-modality micro-positron emission tomography/computed tomography and near-infrared fluorescence imaging of EphB4 in orthotopic glioblastoma xenograft models,"Miao Huang, Chiyi Xiong, Wei Lu, Rui Zhang, Min Zhou, Qian Huang, Jeffrey Weinberg, Chun Li","Purpose: In glioblastoma, EphB4 receptors, a member of the largest family of receptor tyrosine kinases, are overexpressed in both tumor cells and angiogenic blood vessels. The purpose of this study was to examine whether the EphB4-binding peptide TNYL-RAW labeled with both (64)Cu and near-infrared fluorescence dye Cy5.5 could be used as a molecular imaging agent for dual-modality positron emission tomography/computed tomography [PET/CT] and optical imaging of human glioblastoma in orthotopic brain tumor models.

Materials and methods: TNYL-RAW was conjugated to Cy5.5 and the radiometal chelator 1,4,7,10-tetraazadodecane-N,N',N″,N‴-tetraacetic acid. The conjugate was then labeled with (64)Cu for in vitro binding and in vivo dual μPET/CT and optical imaging studies in nude mice implanted with EphB4-expressing U251 and EphB4-negative U87 human glioblastoma cells. Tumors and brains were removed at the end of the imaging sessions for immunohistochemical staining and fluorescence microscopic examinations.

Results: μPET/CT and near-infrared optical imaging clearly showed specific uptake of the dual-labeled TNYL-RAW peptide in both U251 and U87 tumors in the brains of the nude mice after intravenous injection of the peptide. In U251 tumors, the Cy5.5-labeled peptide colocalized with both tumor blood vessels and tumor cells; in U87 tumors, the tracer colocalized only with tumor blood vessels, not with tumor cells.

Conclusions: Dual-labeled EphB4-specific peptide could be used as a noninvasive molecular imaging agent for PET/CT and optical imaging of glioblastoma owing to its ability to bind to both EphB4-expressing angiogenic blood vessels and EphB4-expressing tumor cells.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23918654/
Model dependency and estimation reliability in measurement of cerebral oxygen utilization rate with oxygen-15 and dynamic positron emission tomography,"S C Huang, D G Feng, M E Phelps","The use of oxygen-15 and dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) for the measurement of CMRO was investigated in terms of the achievable accuracy of CMRO and its sensitivity to model configuration assumed in the estimation. Three models of different descriptions for the vascular radioactivity in tissue were examined by computer simulation. By simulating the tracer kinetics with one model and curve fitting them with another, it was found that the CMRO measurement was very sensitive to the model configuration used and it needed kinetic data of low noise level to determine the correct model to use. The approach of sensitivity functions and covariance matrices was used to examine the estimation reliability and error propagation of the model parameters. It was found that for all three model configurations examined the reliability of the CMRO estimate was dependent on the blood flow and oxygen extraction fraction in tissue (approximately 2% in tissues of high blood flow and normal extraction and 10% in tissues of low blood flow and low extraction fraction, in a study of 1 X 10(6) counts/brain slice in 3 min). The estimation reliability is drastically decreased if the total data collection time is reduced to 1 min but is not critically sensitive to the scan sampling interval used. Estimating blood flow or vascular volume simultaneously with CMRO will reduce the reliability of the CMRO estimate by approximately 50%. Propagation of parameter error from blood flow or vascular volume to CMRO is dependent on the model configuration as well as the scanning schedule and estimation procedure used. Results from the study provide useful information for improving the study procedure of CMRO measurements. The present study also illustrates a general representation of PET measurements and an approach that can be applied to other tracer techniques in PET for selecting appropriate model configurations and for designing proper experimental procedures.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3484744/
Textural properties of microglial activation in Alzheimer's disease as measured by (R)-[11C]PK11195 PET,"Marta Lapo Pais, Lília Jorge, Ricardo Martins, Nádia Canário, Ana Carolina Xavier, Rui Bernardes, Antero Abrunhosa, Isabel Santana, Miguel Castelo-Branco","Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia worldwide, accounting for 60-70% of diagnosed cases. According to the current understanding of molecular pathogenesis, the main hallmarks of this disease are the abnormal accumulation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Therefore, biomarkers reflecting these underlying biological mechanisms are recognized as valid tools for an early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. Inflammatory mechanisms, such as microglial activation, are known to be involved in Alzheimer's disease onset and progression. This activated state of the microglia is associated with increased expression of the translocator protein 18 kDa. On that account, PET tracers capable of measuring this signature, such as (R)-[11C]PK11195, might be instrumental in assessing the state and evolution of Alzheimer's disease. This study aims to investigate the potential of Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix-based textural parameters as an alternative to conventional quantification using kinetic models in (R)-[11C]PK11195 PET images. To achieve this goal, kinetic and textural parameters were computed on (R)-[11C]PK11195 PET images of 19 patients with an early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and 21 healthy controls and submitted separately to classification using a linear support vector machine. The classifier built using the textural parameters showed no inferior performance compared to the classical kinetic approach, yielding a slightly larger classification accuracy (accuracy of 0.7000, sensitivity of 0.6957, specificity of 0.7059 and balanced accuracy of 0.6967). In conclusion, our results support the notion that textural parameters may be an alternative to conventional quantification using kinetic models in (R)-[11C]PK11195 PET images. The proposed quantification method makes it possible to use simpler scanning procedures, which increase patient comfort and convenience. We further speculate that textural parameters may also provide an alternative to kinetic analysis in (R)-[11C]PK11195 PET neuroimaging studies involving other neurodegenerative disorders. Finally, we recognize that the potential role of this tracer is not in diagnosis but rather in the assessment and progression of the diffuse and dynamic distribution of inflammatory cell density in this disorder as a promising therapeutic target.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37229217/
Machine learning derived input-function in a dynamic 18F-FDG PET study of mice,"Samuel Kuttner, Kristoffer Knutsen Wickstrøm, Gustav Kalda, S Esmaeil Dorraji, Montserrat Martin-Armas, Ana Oteiza, Robert Jenssen, Kristin Fenton, Rune Sundset, Jan Axelsson","Tracer kinetic modelling, based on dynamic18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) is used to quantify glucose metabolism in humans and animals. Knowledge of the arterial input-function (AIF) is required for such measurements. Our aim was to explore two non-invasive machine learning-based models, for AIF prediction in a small-animal dynamic FDG PET study. 7 tissue regions were delineated in images from 68 FDG PET/computed tomography mouse scans. Two machine learning-based models were trained for AIF prediction, based on Gaussian processes (GP) and a long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network, respectively. Because blood data were unavailable, a reference AIF was formed by fitting an established AIF model to vena cava and left ventricle image data. The predicted and reference AIFs were compared by the area under curve (AUC) and root mean square error (RMSE). Net-influx rate constants, Ki, were calculated with a two-tissue compartment model, using both predicted and reference AIFs for three tissue regions in each mouse scan, and compared by means of error, ratio, correlation coefficient, P value and Bland-Altman analysis. The impact of different tissue regions on AIF prediction was evaluated by training a GP and an LSTM model on subsets of tissue regions, and calculating the RMSE between the reference and the predicted AIF curve. Both models generated AIFs with AUCs similar to reference. The LSTM models resulted in lower AIF RMSE, compared to GP. Kifrom both models agreed well with reference values, with no significant differences. Myocardium was highlighted as important for AIF prediction, but AIFs with similar RMSE were obtained also without myocardium in the input data. Machine learning can be used for accurate and non-invasive prediction of an image-derived reference AIF in FDG studies of mice. We recommend the LSTM approach, as this model predicts AIFs with lower errors, compared to GP.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33438608/
Optimization-derived blood input function using a kernel method and its evaluation with total-body PET for brain parametric imaging,"Yansong Zhu, Quyen Tran, Yiran Wang, Ramsey D Badawi, Simon R Cherry, Jinyi Qi, Shiva Abbaszadeh, Guobao Wang","Dynamic PET allows quantification of physiological parameters through tracer kinetic modeling. For dynamic imaging of brain or head and neck cancer on conventional PET scanners with a short axial field of view, the image-derived input function (ID-IF) from intracranial blood vessels such as the carotid artery (CA) suffers from severe partial volume effects. Alternatively, optimization-derived input function (OD-IF) by the simultaneous estimation (SIME) method does not rely on an ID-IF but derives the input function directly from the data. However, the optimization problem is often highly ill-posed. We proposed a new method that combines the ideas of OD-IF and ID-IF together through a kernel framework. While evaluation of such a method is challenging in human subjects, we used the uEXPLORER total-body PET system that covers major blood pools to provide a reference for validation.

Methods: The conventional SIME approach estimates an input function using a joint estimation together with kinetic parameters by fitting time activity curves from multiple regions of interests (ROIs). The input function is commonly parameterized with a highly nonlinear model which is difficult to estimate. The proposed kernel SIME method exploits the CA ID-IF as a priori information via a kernel representation to stabilize the SIME approach. The unknown parameters are linear and thus easier to estimate. The proposed method was evaluated using18F-fluorodeoxyglucose studies with both computer simulations and 20 human-subject scans acquired on the uEXPLORER scanner. The effect of the number of ROIs on kernel SIME was also explored.

Results: The estimated OD-IF by kernel SIME showed a good match with the reference input function and provided more accurate estimation of kinetic parameters for both simulation and human-subject data. The kernel SIME led to the highest correlation coefficient (R = 0.97) and the lowest mean absolute error (MAE = 10.5 %) compared to using the CA ID-IF (R = 0.86, MAE = 108.2 %) and conventional SIME (R = 0.57, MAE = 78.7 %) in the human-subject evaluation. Adding more ROIs improved the overall performance of the kernel SIME method.

Conclusion: The proposed kernel SIME method shows promise to provide an accurate estimation of the blood input function and kinetic parameters for brain PET parametric imaging.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38643890/
Dynamic PET simulator via tomographic emission projection for kinetic modeling and parametric image studies,"Ida Häggström, Bradley J Beattie, C Ross Schmidtlein","Purpose: To develop and evaluate a fast and simple tool called dpetstep (Dynamic PET Simulator of Tracers via Emission Projection), for dynamic PET simulations as an alternative to Monte Carlo (MC), useful for educational purposes and evaluation of the effects of the clinical environment, postprocessing choices, etc., on dynamic and parametric images.

Methods: The tool was developed in matlab using both new and previously reported modules of petstep (PET Simulator of Tracers via Emission Projection). Time activity curves are generated for each voxel of the input parametric image, whereby effects of imaging system blurring, counting noise, scatters, randoms, and attenuation are simulated for each frame. Each frame is then reconstructed into images according to the user specified method, settings, and corrections. Reconstructed images were compared to MC data, and simple Gaussian noised time activity curves (GAUSS).

Results: dpetstep was 8000 times faster than MC. Dynamic images from dpetstep had a root mean square error that was within 4% on average of that of MC images, whereas the GAUSS images were within 11%. The average bias in dpetstep and MC images was the same, while GAUSS differed by 3% points. Noise profiles in dpetstep images conformed well to MC images, confirmed visually by scatter plot histograms, and statistically by tumor region of interest histogram comparisons that showed no significant differences (p < 0.01). Compared to GAUSS, dpetstep images and noise properties agreed better with MC.

Conclusions: The authors have developed a fast and easy one-stop solution for simulations of dynamic PET and parametric images, and demonstrated that it generates both images and subsequent parametric images with very similar noise properties to those of MC images, in a fraction of the time. They believe dpetstep to be very useful for generating fast, simple, and realistic results, however since it uses simple scatter and random models it may not be suitable for studies investigating these phenomena. dpetstep can be downloaded free of cost from https://github.com/CRossSchmidtlein/dPETSTEP.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27277057/
Pharmacokinetic modeling of [11C]flumazenil kinetics in the rat brain,"Isadora Lopes Alves, David Vállez García, Andrea Parente, Janine Doorduin, Rudi Dierckx, Ana Maria Marques da Silva, Michel Koole, Antoon Willemsen, Ronald Boellaard","Background: Preferred models for the pharmacokinetic analysis of [11C]flumazenil human studies have been previously established. However, direct translation of these models and settings to animal studies might be sub-optimal. Therefore, this study evaluates pharmacokinetic models for the quantification of [11C]flumazenil binding in the rat brain. Dynamic (60 min) [11C]flumazenil brain PET scans were performed in two groups of male Wistar rats (tracer dose (TD), n = 10 and pre-saturated (PS), n = 2). Time-activity curves from five regions were analyzed, including the pons (pseudo-reference region). Distribution volume (VT) was calculated using one- and two-tissue compartment models (1TCM and 2TCM) and spectral analysis (SA). Binding potential (BPND) was determined from full and simplified reference tissue models with one or two compartments for the reference tissue (FRTM, SRTM, and SRTM-2C). Model preference was determined by Akaike information criterion (AIC), while parameter agreement was assessed by linear regression, repeated measurements ANOVA and Bland-Altman plots.

Results: 1TCM and 2TCM fits of regions with high specific binding showed similar AIC, a preference for the 1TCM, and good VTagreement (0.1% difference). In contrast, the 2TCM was markedly preferred and necessary for fitting low specific-binding regions, where a worse VTagreement (17.6% difference) and significant VTdifferences between the models (p < 0.005) were seen. The PS group displayed results similar to those of low specific-binding regions. All reference models (FRTM, SRTM, and SRTM-2C) resulted in at least 13% underestimation of BPND.

Conclusions: Although the 1TCM was sufficient for the quantification of high specific-binding regions, the 2TCM was found to be the most adequate for the quantification of [11C]flumazenil in the rat brain based on (1) higher fit quality, (2) lower AIC values, and (3) ability to provide reliable fits for all regions. Reference models resulted in negatively biased BPNDand were affected by specific binding in the pons of the rat.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28229437/
Deep-learning-derived input function in dynamic [18F]FDG PET imaging of mice,"Samuel Kuttner, Luigi T Luppino, Laurence Convert, Otman Sarrhini, Roger Lecomte, Michael C Kampffmeyer, Rune Sundset, Robert Jenssen","Dynamic positron emission tomography and kinetic modeling play a critical role in tracer development research using small animals. Kinetic modeling from dynamic PET imaging requires accurate knowledge of an input function, ideally determined through arterial blood sampling. Arterial cannulation in mice, however, requires complex, time-consuming and terminal surgery, meaning that longitudinal studies are impossible. The aim of the current work was to develop and evaluate a non-invasive, deep-learning-based prediction model (DLIF) that directly takes the PET data as input to predict a usable input function. We first trained and evaluated the DLIF model on 68 [18F]Fluorodeoxyglucose mouse scans with image-derived targets using cross validation. Subsequently, we evaluated the performance of a trained DLIF model on an external dataset consisting of 8 mouse scans where the input function was measured by continuous arterial blood sampling. The results showed that the predicted DLIF and image-derived targets were similar, and the net influx rate constants following from Patlak modeling using DLIF as input function were strongly correlated to the corresponding values obtained using the image-derived input function. There were somewhat larger discrepancies when evaluating the model on the external dataset, which could be attributed to systematic differences in the experimental setup between the two datasets. In conclusion, our non-invasive DLIF prediction method may be a viable alternative to arterial blood sampling in small animal [18F]FDG imaging. With further validation, DLIF could overcome the need for arterial cannulation and allow fully quantitative and longitudinal experiments in PET imaging studies of mice.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39381031/
Quantitative [18F]-Naf-PET-MRI Analysis for the Evaluation of Dynamic Bone Turnover in a Patient with Facetogenic Low Back Pain,"Nathaniel W Jenkins, Claudia Iriondo, Vinil Shah, Emma Bahroos, Vahid Ravanfar, Melanie Regan, Youngho Seo, William P Dillon, Sharmila Majumdar, Jason F Talbott","Imaging techniques that reflect dynamic bone turnover may aid in characterizing a wide range of bone pathologies. Bone is a dynamic tissue undergoing continuous remodeling with the competing activity of osteoblasts, which produce the new bone matrix, and osteoclasts, whose function is to eliminate mineralized bone. [18F]-NaF is a positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer that enables visualization of bone metabolism. [18F]-NaF is chemically absorbed into hydroxyapatite in the bone matrix by osteoblasts and can thus noninvasively detect osteoblastic activity, which is occult to conventional imaging techniques. Kinetic modeling of dynamic [18F]-NaF-PET data provides detailed quantitative measures of bone metabolism. Conventional semi-quantitative PET data, which utilizes standardized uptake values (SUVs) as a measure of radiotracer activity, is referred to as a static technique due to its snapshot of tracer uptake in time. Kinetic modeling, however, utilizes dynamic image data where tracer levels are continuously acquired providing tracer uptake temporal resolution. From the kinetic modeling of dynamic data, quantitative values like blood flow and metabolic rate (i.e., potentially informative metrics of tracer dynamics) can be extracted, all with respect to the measured activity in the image data. When combined with dual modality PET-MRI, region-specific kinetic data can be correlated with anatomically registered high-resolution structural and pathologic information afforded by MRI. The goal of this methodological manuscript is to outline detailed techniques for performing and analyzing dynamic [18F]-NaF-PET-MRI data. The lumbar facet joint is a common site of degenerative arthritis disease and a common cause for axial low back pain. Recent studies suggest [18F]-NaF-PET may serve as a useful biomarker of painful facetogenic disease. The human lumbar facet joint will, therefore, be used as a prototypical region of interest for dynamic [18F]-NaF-PET-MRI analysis in this manuscript.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31449234/
Impact of deep learning denoising on kinetic modelling for low-dose dynamic PET: application to single- and dual-tracer imaging protocols,"Florence M Muller, Elizabeth J Li, Margaret E Daube-Witherspoon, Austin R Pantel, Corinde E Wiers, Jacob G Dubroff, Christian Vanhove, Stefaan Vandenberghe, Joel S Karp","Purpose: Long-axial field-of-view PET scanners capture multi-organ tracer distribution with high sensitivity, enabling lower dose dynamic protocols and dual-tracer imaging for comprehensive disease characterization. However, reducing dose may compromise data quality and time-activity curve (TAC) fitting, leading to higher bias in kinetic parameters. Parametric imaging poses further challenges due to noise amplification in voxel-based modelling. We explore the potential of deep learning denoising (DL-DN) to improve quantification for low-dose dynamic PET.

Methods: Using 16 [18F]FDG PET studies from the PennPET Explorer, we trained a DL framework on 10-min images from late-phase uptake (static data) that were sub-sampled from 1/2 to 1/300 of the counts. This model was used to denoise early-to-late dynamic frame images. Its impact on quantification was evaluated using compartmental modelling and voxel-based graphical analysis for parametric imaging for single- and dual-tracer dynamic studies with [18F]FDG and [18F]FGln at original (injected) and reduced (sub-sampled) doses. Quantification differences were evaluated for the area under the curve of TACs, Kifor [18F]FDG and VTfor [18F]FGln, and parametric images.

Results: DL-DN consistently improved image quality across all dynamic frames, systematically enhancing TAC consistency and reducing tissue-dependent bias and variability in Kiand VTdown to 40 MBq doses. DL-DN preserved tumor heterogeneity in Logan VTimages and delineation of high-flux regions in Patlak Kimaps. In a /[18F]FDG dual-tracer study, bias trends aligned with single-tracer results but showed reduced accuracy for [¹⁸F]FGln in breast lesions at very low doses (4 MBq).

Conclusion: This study demonstrates that applying DL-DN trained on static [18F]FDG PET images to dynamic [18F]FDG and [18F]FGln PET can permit significantly reduced doses, preserving accurate FDG Kiand FGln VTmeasurements, and enhancing parametric image quality. DL-DN shows promise for improving dynamic PET quantification at reduced doses, including novel dual-tracer studies.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40069458/

To impact the management of AD patients, an in vivo tool for tau Braak staging is needed. First-generation tau tracers have limited performance in detecting early stages of tau. Therefore, we tested the corresponding capability of the next-generation tau tracer,18F-PI-2620. We analyzed18F-PI-2620 multicenter PET data from 37 beta-amyloid-positive AD dementia patients and those from 26 healthy controls. We applied kinetic modeling of the 0-60 min p.i. PET data using MRTM2 with the lower cerebellum as the reference region to extract Braak stage-dependent distribution volume ratios, whereas controls were used to define Braak stage PET positivity thresholds. Stage-dependent PET positivity widely followed the Braak scheme (except Braak stage III) presenting descending frequency of PET positivity from Braak I (43%), II (38%), III (49%), IV (35%), V (30%) to VI (14%). A strictly hierarchical model was met by 64% of AD dementia cases. Nineteen percent showed a hippocampal sparing tauopathy pattern. Thus, we could assign 87% to the six-stage hierarchical Braak model including tauopathy variants.18F-PI-2620 PET appears to be able to perform Braak tau staging of AD in vivo.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35327650/
The influence of measurement uncertainties on the evaluation of the distribution volume ratio and binding potential in rat studies on a microPET R4: a phantom study,"Vesna Sossi, Marie-Laure Camborde, Giorgia Tropini, Danny Newport, Arman Rahmim, Doris J Doudet, Thomas J Ruth","In small animal positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, the injectable radiotracer dose is often limited by the tracer mass which, together with the tracer kinetics and scanner sensitivity, dictates the statistical quality of the time activity curves (TACs) used to extract biological parameters. We investigated the effect of measurement uncertainty on the determination of the distribution volume ratio (DVR) and binding potential (BP) as estimated using the tissue input Logan (DVR(L), BP(L)) and the ratio (DVRr, BPr) methods for two tracers, with the Concorde microPET R4 camera. Parameters' coefficients of variation (COV) were estimated from a combination of rat and phantom data. For 11C-dihydrotetrabenazine, the COV was 11% for the BP(L) and 13.4% for the BPr when using TACs obtained from individual regions of interest (ROIs) and segmented attenuation correction. The COVs were reduced to 7.5% (BP(L)) and 8.6% (BPr) when the striatal and cerebellar TACs were estimated as averages of 3 and 2 ROIs respectively. Results obtained for 11C-methylphenidate (MP) yielded approximately 30% higher COVs. With measured attenuation correction, the COVs were on average 100% higher. The presented method can be used to examine the contribution of a variety of imaging conditions to the uncertainty of biologically meaningful parameters.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15930607/
Human Positron Emission Tomography Neuroimaging,"Jacob M Hooker, Richard E Carson","Neuroimaging with positron emission tomography (PET) is the most powerful tool for understanding pharmacology, neurochemistry, and pathology in the living human brain. This technology combines high-resolution scanners to measure radioactivity throughout the human body with specific, targeted radioactive molecules, which allow measurements of a myriad of biological processes in vivo.While PET brain imaging has been active for almost 40 years, the pace of development for neuroimaging tools, known as radiotracers, and for quantitative analytical techniques has increased dramatically over the past decade. Accordingly, the fundamental questions that can be addressed with PET have expanded in basic neurobiology, psychiatry, neurology, and related therapeutic development. In this review, we introduce the field of human PET neuroimaging, some of its conceptual underpinnings, and motivating questions.

Cerebral benzodiazepine receptor binding in vivo in patients with recurrent hepatic encephalopathy,"G A Macdonald, K A Frey, B W Agranoff, S Minoshima, R A Koeppe, D E Kuhl, B L Shulkin, M R Lucey","Increased activation of the central benzodiazepine receptor (BZR) appears to play an important role in hepatic encephalopathy (HE). However, there is controversy regarding whether the density or affinity of BZRs is altered. A previous positron emission tomography (PET) study using the BZR antagonist [11C]flumazenil (FMZ) found two- to threefold greater cerebral cortical tracer uptake in recurrent HE, but did not account for impaired FMZ metabolism due to liver disease or assess the relative contributions of tracer delivery versus BZR binding. We hypothesized that correcting for these factors would affect estimations of BZR binding in HE. Nine patients with recurrent HE and 13 age-comparable controls were studied with [11C]FMZ PET. After intravenous administration of [11C]FMZ, arterial blood samples were collected, and PET images were acquired over 60 minutes. FMZ transport and binding maps were calculated for each subject by using a physiological tracer kinetic model. In agreement with the previous report, we found that FMZ reached a much higher level and was retained longer in the HE cerebral cortex despite similar total blood radioactivity levels in the two groups. However, the patients showed impaired hepatic metabolism of FMZ. After physiological modeling incorporating these data, significant increases in BZR binding were found in the thalamus (13%), cerebellum (20%), and pons (23%). There were minor, statistically insignificant increases in cerebral cortical (10%), putamen (12%), and whole brain (12%) BZR binding in patients with recurrent HE. These findings are in general agreement with results of autopsy studies, confirming a lack of major increases in cortical or basal ganglial BZR binding in HE. They emphasize that physiological tracer modeling should be used and altered peripheral radioligand metabolism considered in future PET studies of HE.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9252134/
Quantitative evaluation of myocardial blood flow with [13N]ammonia,G D Hutchins,"The clinical need for diagnostic tools that accurately assess the functional status of the heart in patients with coronary artery disease and their response to therapeutic interventions has driven the development of noninvasive PET imaging techniques for measuring myocardial blood flow.

The formation of the [13N]ammonia tracer kinetic model for quantitative estimates of myocardial blood flow is presented. In addition, methods for coupling the tracer kinetic model with a simple geometric model representing the heart and bloodpool are described to minimize the bias introduced by the limited image resolution achieved in PET studies of the heart.

Quantification of Dynamic 11C-Phenytoin PET Studies,"Syahir Mansor, Ronald Boellaard, Femke E Froklage, Esther D M Bakker, Maqsood Yaqub, Rob A Voskuyl, Lothar A Schwarte, Joost Verbeek, Albert D Windhorst, Adriaan Lammertsma","The overexpression of P-glycoprotein (Pgp) is thought to be an important mechanism of pharmacoresistance in epilepsy. Recently, (11)C-phenytoin has been evaluated preclinically as a tracer for Pgp. The aim of the present study was to assess the optimal plasma kinetic model for quantification of (11)C-phenytoin studies in humans.

Methods: Dynamic (11)C-phenytoin PET scans of 6 healthy volunteers with arterial sampling were acquired twice on the same day and analyzed using single- and 2-tissue-compartment models with and without a blood volume parameter. Global and regional test-retest (TRT) variability was determined for both plasma to tissue rate constant (K1) and volume of distribution (VT).

Results: According to the Akaike information criterion, the reversible single-tissue-compartment model with blood volume parameter was the preferred plasma input model. Mean TRT variability ranged from 1.5% to 16.9% for K1 and from 0.5% to 5.8% for VT. Larger volumes of interest showed better repeatabilities than smaller regions. A 45-min scan provided essentially the same K1 and VT values as a 60-min scan.

Conclusion: A reversible single-tissue-compartment model with blood volume seems to be a good candidate model for quantification of dynamic (11)C-phenytoin studies. Scan duration may be reduced to 45 min without notable loss of accuracy and precision of both K1 and VT, although this still needs to be confirmed under pathologic conditions.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26135114/
Comparison of 1-(11)C-glucose and (18)F-FDG for quantifying myocardial glucose use with PET,"Pilar Herrero, Terry L Sharp, Carmen Dence, Brendan M Haraden, Robert J Gropler","In this study, we compared the accuracy of the rate of myocardial glucose use (rMGU) measured using PET and 1-(11)C-glucose with the rate measured using PET and the more conventional tracer (18)F-FDG.

Methods: PET measurements of myocardial tracer uptake (K, in mL/g/min) and rMGU (in nmol/g/min) were obtained with 1-(11)C-glucose and (18)F-FDG in 21 dogs using kinetic modeling and the Patlak graphical method, respectively. Eighteen dogs were studied during hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp performed either at rest or combined with phenylephrine, dobutamine, intralipid infusion, or intralipid infusion and dobutamine. Three dogs were studied during intralipid infusion alone under resting conditions. Arterial-coronary sinus sampling was performed to measure the K of both tracers (n = 14) and rMGU by the Fick method (n = 21).

Results: PET-derived values for K from either 1-(11)C-glucose or (18)F-FDG correlated closely with directly measured tracer K values (glucose: y = 0.98x + 0.01, r = 0.79, P < 0.001; (18)F-FDG: y = 0.74x + 0.03, r = 0.77, P < 0.001). In contrast, correlation with K values of unlabeled glucose measured directly was better for 1-(11)C-glucose (y = 0.92x + 0.02, r = 0.96, P < 0.0001) than for (18)F-FDG (y = 0.66x + 0.05, r = 0.72, P < 0.01) (P < 0.001 for comparison of correlation coefficients). As a consequence, PET-derived values for rMGU correlated more closely with Fick-derived measurements of unlabeled glucose using 1-(11)C-glucose (y = 0.82x + 168, r = 0.97, P < 0.0001) than with (18)F-FDG (y = 0.81x + 278, r = 0.79, P < 0.001) (P < 0.001 for comparison of correlation coefficients).

Conclusion: Over a wide range of conditions, PET-derived measurements of rMGU are obtained more accurately with 1-(11)C-glucose than with (18)F-FDG.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12411556/

In contrast to previous studies in tumors, early specific uptake was followed by rapid washout. Myocardial kinetics of (124)I-FIAU are still poorly understood. This study aimed at a further investigation under controlled conditions using an isolated heart perfusion model.

Methods: Male Wistar rats underwent transthoracic regional injection of replication-defective adenovirus (2.5 x 10(9) plaque-forming units) containing either HSV1-tk (n = 16) or LacZ reporter gene (n = 15) into the inferior wall. Nonmanipulated rats (n = 5) served as further controls. Hearts were excised 2 d later and perfused according to the Langendorff technique with (124)I-FIAU-containing buffer (15 min, followed by 30 min of nonradioactive perfusion). Experiments were performed under baseline conditions and in the presence of thymidine (competitive substrate) or fludarabine (in vitro inhibitor of 5'-nucleotidase). Time-activity curves were acquired by external coincident detectors. The myocardial rate of (124)I-FIAU uptake (K(i)), clearance rate (K(o)), and volume of distribution (V(d) = K(i)/K(o)) were calculated. Subsequently, hearts were subjected to gamma-counting, followed by microtome slicing and autoradiography.

Results: The V(d) from Langendorff perfusion significantly correlated with final whole-heart tracer retention (r = 0.88, P = 0.019) and the autoradiographic area of regional myocardial activity (r = 0.89, P = 0.016). HSV1-tk hearts showed higher K(i) and V(d) of (124)I-FIAU compared with that of controls (P < 0.001) and detectable but slower washout compared with that of the LacZ group (P < 0.01). Addition of thymidine to the perfusate inhibited myocardial uptake of (124)I-FIAU by reducing V(d) and K(i) in HSV1-tk and LacZ hearts compared with the baseline. Addition of fludarabine did not result in the expected reduction of washout in HSV1-tk hearts due to inhibition of 5'-nucleotidases (which may dephosphorylate (124)I-FIAU monophosphate). It acted as an uptake inhibitor similar to thymidine, reducing V(d) in HSV1-tk hearts.

Conclusion: Assessment of specific reporter probe kinetics after regional in vivo reporter gene transfer is feasible using the isolated perfused rat heart preparation. This model allows one to study the effects of pharmacologic interventions and may refine understanding of the reporter probe signal for in vivo imaging. Different nucleoside analogs significantly inhibit (124)I-FIAU uptake, emphasizing the importance of transporter mechanisms for reporter probe kinetics.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15632039/
Image-derived input function for human brain using high resolution PET imaging with [C](R)-rolipram and [C]PBR28,"Paolo Zanotti-Fregonara, Jeih-San Liow, Masahiro Fujita, Elodie Dusch, Sami S Zoghbi, Elise Luong, Ronald Boellaard, Victor W Pike, Claude Comtat, Robert B Innis","Background: The aim of this study was to test seven previously published image-input methods in state-of-the-art high resolution PET brain images. Images were obtained with a High Resolution Research Tomograph plus a resolution-recovery reconstruction algorithm using two different radioligands with different radiometabolite fractions. Three of the methods required arterial blood samples to scale the image-input, and four were blood-free methods.

Methods: All seven methods were tested on twelve scans with [(11)C](R)-rolipram, which has a low radiometabolite fraction, and on nineteen scans with [(11)C]PBR28 (high radiometabolite fraction). Logan V(T) values for both blood and image inputs were calculated using the metabolite-corrected input functions. The agreement of image-derived Logan V(T) values with the reference blood-derived Logan V(T) values was quantified using a scoring system. Using the image input methods that gave the most accurate results with Logan analysis, we also performed kinetic modelling with a two-tissue compartment model.

Results: For both radioligands the highest scores were obtained with two blood-based methods, while the blood-free methods generally performed poorly. All methods gave higher scores with [(11)C](R)-rolipram, which has a lower metabolite fraction. Compartment modeling gave less reliable results, especially for the estimation of individual rate constants.

Conclusion: OUR STUDY SHOWS THAT: 1) Image input methods that are validated for a specific tracer and a specific machine may not perform equally well in a different setting; 2) despite the use of high resolution PET images, blood samples are still necessary to obtain a reliable image input function; 3) the accuracy of image input may also vary between radioligands depending on the magnitude of the radiometabolite fraction: the higher the metabolite fraction of a given tracer (e.g., [(11)C]PBR28), the more difficult it is to obtain a reliable image-derived input function; and 4) in association with image inputs, graphical analyses should be preferred over compartmental modelling.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21364880/
"68Ga-labelled exendin-3, a new agent for the detection of insulinomas with PET","Maarten Brom, Wim J G Oyen, Lieke Joosten, Martin Gotthardt, Otto C Boerman","Purpose: Insulinomas are neuroendocrine tumours derived from pancreatic beta-cells. The glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1R) is expressed with a high incidence (>90%) and high density in insulinomas. Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), the natural ligand of GLP-1R, is rapidly degraded in vivo. A more stable agonist of GLP-1R is exendin-3. We investigated imaging of insulinomas with DOTA-conjugated exendin-3 labelled with (68)Ga.

Methods: Targeting of insulinomas with [Lys(40)(DOTA)]exendin-3 labelled with either (111)In or (68)Ga was investigated in vitro using insulinoma tumour cells (INS-1). [Lys(40)((111)In-DTPA)]Exendin-3 was used as a reference in this study. In vivo targeting was investigated in BALB/c nude mice with subcutaneous INS-1 tumours. PET imaging was performed using a preclinical PET/CT scanner.

Results: In vitro exendin-3 specifically bound and was internalized by GLP-1R-positive cells. In BALB/c nude mice with subcutaneous INS-1 tumours a high uptake of [Lys(40)((111)In-DTPA)]exendin-3 in the tumour was observed (33.5 +/- 11.6%ID/g at 4 h after injection). Uptake was specific, as determined by coinjection of an excess of unlabelled [Lys(40)]exendin-3 (1.8 +/- 0.1%ID/g). The pancreas also exhibited high and specific uptake (11.3 +/- 1.0%ID/g). High uptake was also found in the kidneys (144 +/- 24%ID/g) and this uptake was not receptor-mediated. In this murine tumour model optimal targeting of the GLP-1R expressing tumour was obtained at exendin doses < or =0.1 microg. Remarkably, tumour uptake of (68)Ga-labelled [Lys(40)(DOTA)]exendin-3 was lower (8.9 +/- 3.1%ID/g) than tumour uptake of (111)In-labelled [Lys(40)(DTPA)]exendin-3 (25.4 +/- 7.2%ID/g). The subcutaneous tumours were clearly visualized by small-animal PET imaging after injection of 3 MBq of [Lys(40)((68)Ga-DOTA)]exendin-3.

Conclusion: [Lys(40)((68)Ga-DOTA)]Exendin-3 specifically accumulates in insulinomas, although the uptake is lower than that of [Lys(40)((111)In-DTPA)]exendin-3. Therefore, [Lys(40)((68)Ga-DOTA)]exendin-3 is a promising tracer to visualize insulinomas with PET.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20111963/
Increasing molar activity by HPLC purification improves 68Ga-DOTA-NAPamide tumor accumulation in a B16/F1 melanoma xenograft model,"Jan Lennart von Hacht, Sarah Erdmann, Lars Niederstadt, Sonal Prasad, Asja Wagener, Samantha Exner, Nicola Beindorff, Winfried Brenner, Carsten Grötzinger","Purpose: Melanocortin receptor 1 (MC1R) is overexpressed in melanoma and may be a molecular target for imaging and peptide receptor radionuclide therapy. 68Gallium (68Ga) labeling of DOTA-conjugated peptides is an established procedure in the clinic for use in positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. Aim of this study was to compare a standard labeling protocol against the 68Ga-DOTA peptide purified from the excess of unlabeled peptide.

Procedures: The MC1R ligand DOTA-NAPamide was labeled with 68Ga using a standard clinical protocol. Radioactive peptide was separated from the excess of unlabeled DOTA-NAPamide by HPLC. Immediately after the incubation of peptide and 68Ga (95°C, 15 min), the reaction was loaded on a C18 column and separated by a water/acetonitrile gradient, allowing fractionation in less than 20 minutes. Radiolabeled products were compared in biodistribution studies and PET imaging using nude mice bearing MC1R-expressing B16/F1 xenograft tumors.

Results: In biodistribution studies, non-purified 68Ga-DOTA-NAPamide did not show significant uptake in the tumor at 1 h post injection (0.78% IA/g). By the additional HPLC step, the molar activity was raised around 10,000-fold by completely removing unlabeled peptide. Application of this rapid purification strategy led to a more than 8-fold increase in tumor uptake (7.0% IA/g). The addition of various amounts of unlabeled DOTA-NAPamide to the purified product led to a blocking effect and decreased specific tumor uptake, similar to the result seen with non-purified radiopeptide. PET imaging was performed using the same tracer preparations. Purified 68Ga-DOTA-NAPamide, in comparison, showed superior tumor uptake.

Conclusions: We demonstrated that chromatographic separation of radiolabeled from excess unlabeled peptide is technically feasible and beneficial, even for short-lived isotopes such as 68Ga. Unlabeled peptide molecules compete with receptor binding sites in the target tissue. Purification of the radiopeptide therefore improved tumor uptake.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31163066/
In-vivo imaging of Alzheimer disease beta-amyloid with [11C]SB-13 PET,"Nicolaas P L G Verhoeff, Alan A Wilson, Shinichiro Takeshita, Liat Trop, Doug Hussey, Kernjit Singh, Hank F Kung, Mei-Ping Kung, Sylvain Houle","Objective: In-vivo imaging of beta-amyloid plaques (Abeta) may improve both early detection of Alzheimer disease (AD) and efficacy assessment of new treatments for AD. The authors' aim was to develop a novel Abeta-specific positron-emission tomography (PET) tracer.

Methods: Five female AD patients (54-77 years old) and six healthy female comparison subjects (53-74 years old), completed 2-hour PET scans after intravenous injection of 10 mCi of both the stilbene [11C]SB-13 and the benzothiazole [11C]6-OH-BTA-1 (also known as [11C]PIB). Kinetic analyses were performed on the resulting time-activity curves to derive Abeta binding-potential estimates, using as input function either the unmetabolized tracer concentration in venous plasma from a two-tissue compartment model or the density of radioactivity in the cerebellum. Authors compared the binding characteristics of the two radiotracers.

Results: The two radiotracers demonstrated similar binding properties with respect to regional distribution of retention (increased retention in the frontal and posterior temporal-inferior parietal association cortices in the AD patients, but not in the comparison subjects). Our preliminary PET data indicate that [11C]SB-13 may be similar to [11C]PIB in discriminating AD patients from comparison subjects.

Conclusions: [11C]SB-13 is an effective PET tracer for fibrillar Abeta imaging in vivo, with similar performance as [11C]PIB. Future research directions include evaluation of tracer in larger AD patient samples and in subjects with amnestic mild cognitive impairment, evaluation of arterial input function, and comparison with other tracers, such as [18F]FDG as they relate to cognitive functioning.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15545326/
Spatially constrained kinetic modeling with dual reference tissues improves 18F-flortaucipir PET in studies of Alzheimer disease,"Yun Zhou, Shaney Flores, Syahir Mansor, Russ C Hornbeck, Zhude Tu, Joel S Perlmutter, Beau Ances, John C Morris, Robert J Gropler, Tammie L S Benzinger","Purpose: Recent studies have shown that standard compartmental models using plasma input or the cerebellum reference tissue input are generally not reliable for quantifying tau burden in dynamic18F-flortaucipir PET studies of Alzheimer disease. So far, the optimal reference region for estimating18F-flortaucipir delivery and specific tau binding has yet to be determined. The objective of the study is to improve18F-flortaucipir brain tau PET quantification using a spatially constrained kinetic model with dual reference tissues.

Methods: Participants were classified as either cognitively normal (CN) or cognitively impaired (CI) based on clinical assessment. T1-weighted structural MRI and 105-min dynamic18F-flortaucipir PET scans were acquired for each participant. Using both a simplified reference tissue model (SRTM2) and Logan plot with either cerebellum gray matter or centrum semiovale (CS) white matter as the reference tissue, we estimated distribution volume ratios (DVRs) and the relative transport rate constant R1for region of interest-based (ROI) and voxelwise-based analyses. Conventional linear regression (LR) and LR with spatially constrained (LRSC) parametric imaging algorithms were then evaluated. Noise-induced bias in the parametric images was compared to estimates from ROI time activity curve-based kinetic modeling. We finally evaluated standardized uptake value ratios at early phase (SUVREP, 0.7-2.9 min) and late phase (SUVRLP, 80-105 min) to approximate R1and DVR, respectively.

Results: The percent coefficients of variation of R1and DVR estimates from SRTM2 with spatially constrained modeling were comparable to those from the Logan plot and SUVRs. The SRTM2 using CS reference tissue with LRSC reduced noise-induced underestimation in the LR generated DVR images to negligible levels (< 1%). Inconsistent overestimation of DVR in the SUVRLPonly occurred using the cerebellum reference tissue-based measurements. The CS reference tissue-based DVR and SUVRLP, and cerebellum-based SUVREPand R1provided higher Cohen's effect size d to detect increased tau deposition and reduced relative tracer transport rate in CI individuals.

Conclusion: Using a spatially constrained kinetic model with dual reference tissues significantly improved quantification of relative perfusion and tau binding. Cerebellum and CS are the suggested reference tissues to estimate R1and DVR, respectively, for dynamic18F-flortaucipir PET studies. Cerebellum-based SUVREPand CS-based SUVRLPmay be used to simplify18F-flortaucipir PET study.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33599811/
Development and Validation of an Immuno-PET Tracer as a Companion Diagnostic Agent for Antibody-Drug Conjugate Therapy to Target the CA6 Epitope,"Ohad Ilovich, Arutselvan Natarajan, Sharon Hori, Ataya Sathirachinda, Richard Kimura, Ananth Srinivasan, Mathias Gebauer, Jochen Kruip, Ingo Focken, Christian Lange, Chantal Carrez, Ingrid Sassoon, Veronique Blanc, Susanta K Sarkar, Sanjiv S Gambhir","Purpose: To develop and compare three copper 64 ((64)Cu)-labeled antibody fragments derived from a CA6-targeting antibody (huDS6) as immuno-positron emission tomography (immuno-PET)-based companion diagnostic agents for an antibody-drug conjugate by using huDS6.

Materials and methods: Three antibody fragments derived from huDS6 were produced, purified, conjugated to 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid (DOTA), and evaluated in the following ways: (a) the affinity of the fragments and the DOTA conjugates was measured via flow cytometry, (b) the stability of the labeled fragments was determined ex vivo in human serum over 24 hours, and (c) comparison of the in vivo imaging potential of the fragments was evaluated in mice bearing subcutaneous CA6-positive and CA6-negative xenografts by using serial PET imaging and biodistribution. Isotype controls with antilysozyme and anti-DM4 B-Fabs and blocking experiments with an excess of either B-Fab or huDS6 were used to determine the extent of the antibody fragment (64)Cu-DOTA-B-Fab binding specificity. Immunoreactivity and tracer kinetics were evaluated by using cellular uptake and 48-hour imaging experiments, respectively. Statistical analyses were performed by using t tests, one-way analysis of variance, and Wilcoxon and Mann-Whitney tests.

Results: The antibody fragment (64)Cu-DOTA-B-Fab was more than 95% stable after 24 hours in human serum, had an immunoreactivity of more than 70%, and allowed differentiation between CA6-positive and CA6-negative tumors in vivo as early as 6 hours after injection, with a 1.7-fold uptake ratio between tumors. Isotype and blocking studies experiments showed tracer-specific uptake in antigen-positive tumors, despite some nonspecific uptake in both tumor models.

Conclusion: Three antibody fragments were produced and examined as potential companion diagnostic agents. (64)Cu-DOTA-B-Fab is a stable and effective immuno-PET tracer for CA6 imaging in vivo.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25734548/
Kinetic analysis of HER2-binding ABY-025 Affibody molecule using dynamic PET in patients with metastatic breast cancer,"Ali Alhuseinalkhudhur, Mark Lubberink, Henrik Lindman, Vladimir Tolmachev, Fredrik Y Frejd, Joachim Feldwisch, Irina Velikyan, Jens Sörensen","Background: High expression of human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2) represents an aggressive subtype of breast cancer. Anti-HER2 treatment requires a theragnostic approach wherein sufficiently high receptor expression in biopsy material is mandatory. Heterogeneity and discordance of HER2 expression between primary tumour and metastases, as well as within a lesion, present a complication for the treatment and require multiple biopsies. Molecular imaging using the HER2-targeting Affibody peptide ABY-025 radiolabelled with68Ga-gallium for PET/CT is currently under investigation as a non-invasive tool for whole-body evaluation of metastatic HER2 expression. Initial studies demonstrated a high correlation between68Ga-ABY-025 standardized uptake values (SUVs) and histopathology. However, detecting small liver lesions might be compromised by high background uptake. This study aimed to explore the applicability of kinetic modelling and parametric image analysis for absolute quantification of68Ga-ABY-025 uptake and HER2-receptor expression and how that relates to static SUVs.

Methods: Dynamic68Ga-ABY-025 PET of the upper abdomen was performed 0-45 min post-injection in 16 patients with metastatic breast cancer. Five patients underwent two examinations to test reproducibility. Parametric images of tracer delivery (K1) and irreversible binding (Ki) were created with an irreversible two-tissue compartment model and Patlak graphical analysis using an image-derived input function from the descending aorta. A volume of interest (VOI)-based analysis was performed to validate parametric images. SUVs were calculated from 2 h and 4 h post-injection static whole-body images and compared to Ki.

Results: Characterization of HER2 expression in smaller liver metastases was improved using parametric images. Kivalues from parametric images agreed very well with VOI-based gold standard (R2> 0.99, p < 0.001). SUVs of metastases at 2 h and 4 h post-injection were highly correlated with Kivalues from both the two-tissue compartment model and Patlak method (R2= 0.87 and 0.95, both p < 0.001).68Ga-ABY-025 PET yielded high test-retest reliability (relative repeatability coefficient for Patlak 30% and for the two-tissue compartment model 47%).

Conclusion: 68Ga-ABY-025 binding in HER2-positive metastases was well characterized by irreversible two-tissue compartment model wherein Kihighly correlated with SUVs at 2 and 4 h. Dynamic scanning with parametric image formation can be used to evaluate metastatic HER2 expression accurately.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32201920/
Clustering-initiated factor analysis application for tissue classification in dynamic brain positron emission tomography,"Rostyslav Boutchko, Debasis Mitra, Suzanne L Baker, William J Jagust, Grant T Gullberg","The goal is to quantify the fraction of tissues that exhibit specific tracer binding in dynamic brain positron emission tomography (PET). It is achieved using a new method of dynamic image processing: clustering-initiated factor analysis (CIFA). Standard processing of such data relies on region of interest analysis and approximate models of the tracer kinetics and of tissue properties, which can degrade accuracy and reproducibility of the analysis. Clustering-initiated factor analysis allows accurate determination of the time-activity curves and spatial distributions for tissues that exhibit significant radiotracer concentration at any stage of the emission scan, including the arterial input function. We used this approach in the analysis of PET images obtained using (11)C-Pittsburgh Compound B in which specific binding reflects the presence of β-amyloid. The fraction of the specific binding tissues determined using our approach correlated with that computed using the Logan graphical analysis. We believe that CIFA can be an accurate and convenient tool for measuring specific binding tissue concentration and for analyzing tracer kinetics from dynamic images for a variety of PET tracers. As an illustration, we show that four-factor CIFA allows extraction of two blood curves and the corresponding distributions of arterial and venous blood from PET images even with a coarse temporal resolution.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25899294/
Accurate image derived input function in [18F]SynVesT-1 mouse studies using isoflurane and ketamine/xylazine anesthesia,"Alan Miranda, Daniele Bertoglio, Steven Staelens, Jeroen Verhaeghe","Background: Kinetic modeling in positron emission tomography (PET) requires measurement of the tracer plasma activity in the absence of a suitable reference region. To avoid invasive blood sampling, the use of an image derived input function has been proposed. However, an accurate delineation of the blood pool region in the PET image is necessary to obtain unbiased blood activity. Here, to perform brain kinetic modeling in [18F]SynVesT-1 dynamic scans, we make use of non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to unmix the activity signal from the different tissues that can contribute to the heart region activity, and extract only the left ventricle activity in an unbiased way. This method was implemented in dynamic [18F]SynVesT-1 scans of mice anesthetized with either isoflurane or ketamine-xylazine, two anesthestics that we showed to affect differently radiotracer kinetics. The left ventricle activity (NMF-IDIF) and a manually delineated cardiac activity (IDIF) were compared with arterial blood samples (ABS), and for isoflurane anesthetized mice, arteriovenous (AV) shunt blood data were compared as well. Finally, brain regional 2 tissue compartment modeling was performed using IDIF and NMF-IDIF, and the model fit accuracy (weighted symmetrical mean absolute percentage error, wsMAPE) as well as the total volume of distribution (VT) were compared.

Results: In isoflurane anesthetized mice, the difference between ABS and NMF-IDIF activity (+ 12.8 [Formula: see text] 11%, p = 0.0023) was smaller than with IDIF (+ 16.4 [Formula: see text] 9.8%, p = 0.0008). For ketamine-xylazine anesthetized mice the reduction in difference was larger (NMF-IDIF: 16.9 [Formula: see text] 10%, p = 0.0057, IDIF: 56.3 [Formula: see text] 14%, p < 0.0001). Correlation coefficient between isoflurane AV-shunt time activity curves and NMF-IDIF (0.97 [Formula: see text] 0.01) was higher than with IDIF (0.94 [Formula: see text] 0.03). The brain regional 2TCM wsMAPE was improved using NMF-IDIF compared with IDIF, in isoflurane (NMF-IDIF: 1.24 [Formula: see text] 0.24%, IDIF: 1.56 [Formula: see text] 0.30%) and ketamine-xylazine (NMF-IDIF: 1.40 [Formula: see text] 0.24, IDIF: 2.62 [Formula: see text] 0.27) anesthetized mice. Finally, brain VTwas significantly (p < 0.0001) higher using NMF-IDIF compared with IDIF, in isoflurane (3.97 [Formula: see text] 0.13% higher) and ketamine-xylazine (32.7 [Formula: see text] 2.4% higher) anesthetized mice.

Conclusions: Image derived left ventricle blood activity calculated with NMF improves absolute activity quantification, and reduces the error in the kinetic modeling fit. These improvements are more pronounced in ketamine-xylazine than in isoflurane anesthetized mice.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38052966/

Its total-body coverage and ultra-high sensitivity provide opportunities for more accurate tracer kinetic analysis in studies of physiology, biochemistry, and pharmacology. The objective of this study was to demonstrate the capability of total-body parametric imaging and to quantify the improvement in image quality and kinetic parameter estimation by direct and kernel reconstruction of the uEXPLORER data.Methods:We developed quantitative parametric image reconstruction methods for kinetic analysis and used them to analyze the first human dynamic total-body PET study. A healthy female subject was recruited, and a 1-h dynamic scan was acquired during and after an intravenous injection of 256 MBq of18F-FDG. Dynamic data were reconstructed using a 3-dimensional time-of-flight list-mode ordered-subsets expectation maximization (OSEM) algorithm and a kernel-based algorithm with all quantitative corrections implemented in the forward model. The Patlak graphical model was used to analyze the18F-FDG kinetics in the whole body. The input function was extracted from a region over the descending aorta. For comparison, indirect Patlak analysis from reconstructed frames and direct reconstruction of parametric images from the list-mode data were obtained for the last 30 min of data.Results:Images reconstructed by OSEM showed good quality with low noise, even for the 1-s frames. The image quality was further improved using the kernel method. Total-body Patlak parametric images were obtained using either indirect estimation or direct reconstruction. The direct reconstruction method improved the parametric image quality, having a better contrast-versus-noise tradeoff than the indirect method, with a 2- to 3-fold variance reduction. The kernel-based indirect Patlak method offered image quality similar to the direct Patlak method, with less computation time and faster convergence.Conclusion:This study demonstrated the capability of total-body parametric imaging using the uEXPLORER. Furthermore, the results showed the benefits of kernel-regularized reconstruction and direct parametric reconstruction. Both can achieve superior image quality for tracer kinetic studies compared with the conventional indirect OSEM for total-body imaging.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31302637/
Toward Novel [18F]Fluorine-Labeled Radiotracers for the Imaging of α-Synuclein Fibrils,"Bright C Uzuegbunam, Junhao Li, Wojciech Paslawski, Wolfgang Weber, Per Svenningsson, Hans Ågren, Behrooz Hooshyar Yousefi","The accumulation of α-synuclein aggregates (α-syn) in the human brain is an occurrence common to all α-synucleinopathies. Non-invasive detection of these aggregates in a living brain with a target-specific radiotracer is not yet possible. We have recently discovered that the inclusion of a methylenedioxy group in the structure of diarylbisthiazole (DABTA)-based tracers improves binding affinity and selectivity to α-syn. Subsequently, complementaryin silicomodeling and machine learning (ML) of tracer-protein interactions were employed to predict surface sites and structure-property relations for the binding of the ligands. Based on this observation, we developed a small focused library of DABTAs from which 4-(benzo[d][1,3]dioxol-5-yl)-4'-(3-[18F]fluoro-4-methoxyphenyl)-2,2'-bithiazole[18F]d2, 6-(4'-(3-[18F]fluoro-4-methoxyphenyl)-[2,2'-bithiazol]-4-yl)-[1,3]dioxolo[4,5-b]pyridine[18F]d4, 4-(benzo [d][1,3]dioxol-5-yl)-4'-(6-[18F]fluoropyridin-3-yl)-2,2'-bithiazole[18F]d6, and 6-(4'-(6-[18F]fluoropyridin-3-yl)-[2,2'-bithiazol]-4-yl)-[1,3]dioxolo[4,5-b]pyridine[18F]d8were selected based on their high binding affinity to α-syn and were further evaluated. Binding assay experiments carried out with the non-radioactive versions of the above tracersd2,d4,d6, andd8showed high binding affinity of the ligands to α-syn: 1.22, 0.66, 1.21, and 0.10 nM, respectively, as well as excellent selectivity over β-amyloid plaques (Aβ) and microtubular tau aggregates (>200-fold selectivity). To obtain the tracers, their precursors were radiolabeled eitherviaan innovative ruthenium-mediated (SNAr) reaction ([18F]d2and[18F]d4) or typical SNAr reaction ([18F]d6and[18F]d8) with moderate-to-high radiochemical yields (13% - 40%), and high molar activity > 60 GBq/μmol. Biodistribution experiments carried out with the tracers in healthy mice revealed that[18F]d2and[18F]d4showed suboptimal brain pharmacokinetics: 1.58 and 4.63 %ID/g at 5 min post-injection (p.i.), and 1.93 and 3.86 %ID/g at 60 min p.i., respectively. However,[18F]d6and[18F]d8showed improved brain pharmacokinetics: 5.79 and 5.13 %ID/g at 5 min p.i.; 1.75 and 1.07 %ID/g at 60 min p.i.; and 1.04 and 0.58 %ID/g at 120 min p.i., respectively. The brain uptake kinetics of[18F]d6and[18F]d8were confirmed in a dynamic PET study. Both tracers also showed no brain radiometabolites at 20 min p.i. in initialin vivostability experiments carried out in healthy mice.[18F]d8seems very promising based on its binding properties andin vivostability, thus encouraging further validation of its usefulness as a radiotracer for thein vivovisualization of α-syn in preclinical and clinical settings.

Determination of the in vivo selectivity of a new κ-opioid receptor antagonist PET tracer 11C-LY2795050 in the rhesus monkey,"Su Jin Kim, Ming-Qiang Zheng, Nabeel Nabulsi, David Labaree, Jim Ropchan, Soheila Najafzadeh, Richard E Carson, Yiyun Huang, Evan D Morris","(11)C-LY2795050 is a novel κ-selective antagonist PET tracer. The in vitro binding affinities (Ki) of LY2795050 at the κ-opioid (KOR) and μ-opioid (MOR) receptors are 0.72 and 25.8 nM, respectively. Thus, the in vitro KOR/MOR binding selectivity is about 36:1. Our goal in this study was to determine the in vivo selectivity of this new KOR antagonist tracer in the monkey.

Methods: To estimate the ED50 value (dose of a compound [or drug] that gives 50% occupancy of the target receptor) of LY2795050 at the MOR and KOR sites, 2 series of blocking experiments were performed in 3 rhesus monkeys using (11)C-LY2795050 and (11)C-carfentanil with coinjections of various doses of unlabeled LY2795050. Kinetic modeling was applied to calculate regional binding potential (BP(ND)), and 1- and 2-site binding curves were fitted to these data to measure (11)C-LY2795050 binding selectivity.

Results: The LY2795050 ED50 at MOR was 119 μg/kg based on a 1-site model for (11)C-carfentanil. The 1-site binding model was also deemed sufficient to describe the specific binding of (11)C-LY2795050 at KOR. The ED50 at KOR estimated from the 1-site model was 15.6 μg/kg. Thus, the ED50 ratio for MOR:KOR was 7.6.

Conclusion: The in vivo selectivity of (11)C-LY2795050 for KOR over MOR is 7.6. (11)C-LY2795050 has 4.7-fold-lower selectivity at KOR over MOR in vivo as compared with in vitro. Nevertheless, on the basis of our finding in vivo, 88% of the PET-observed specific binding of (11)C-LY2795050 under baseline conditions will be due to binding of the tracer at the KOR site in a region with similar prevalence of KOR and MOR. (11)C-LY2795050 is sufficiently selective for KOR over MOR in vivo to be considered an appropriate probe for studying the KOR with PET.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23918735/
Tyrosine transport is regulated differently in patients with schizophrenia,"F A Wiesel, J L Andersson, G Westerberg, I M Wieselgren, L Bjerkenstedt, L Hagenfeldt, B Långström","Previous PET studies of tyrosine transport have suggested that the transport of tyrosine from blood to brain compartment is not dependent on its plasma concentration in patients with schizophrenia. In order to examine this relationship, the transport constant (K1) of tyrosine was determined in five patients with schizophrenia and five normals. L-[1-11C]Tyrosine was injected i.v. and arterial blood samples were taken during PET scanning. The tyrosine transport was assessed during baseline conditions and after oral administration of L-tyrosine at a dose (175 mg/kg) that significantly elevated the plasma levels. K1 was determined from tracer kinetic modelling. The transport rate dropped in the normals after tyrosine loading, which is consistent with the prevailing notion that the brain transport system for neutral amino acids works close to saturation, whereas it was virtually unchanged in the schizophrenics. The results demonstrated that tyrosine transport was not saturated in the patients with schizophrenia and thus could lead to elevated brain concentrations of tyrosine.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10541005/
Dynamic imaging and tracer kinetic modeling for emission tomography using rotating detectors,"C H Lau, D Feng, B F Hutton, D P Lun, W C Siu","When performing dynamic studies using emission tomography the tracer distribution changes during acquisition of a single set of projections. This is particularly true for some positron emission tomography (PET) systems which, like single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), acquire data over a limited angle at any time, with full projections obtained by rotation of the detectors. In this paper, an approach is proposed for processing data from these systems, applicable to either PET or SPECT. A method of interpolation, based on overlapped parabolas, is used to obtain an estimate of the total counts in each pixel of the projections for each required frame-interval, which is the total time to acquire a single complete set of projections necessary for reconstruction. The resultant projections are reconstructed using traditional filtered backprojection (FBP) and tracer kinetic parameters are estimated using a method which relies on counts integrated over the frame-interval rather than instantaneous values. Simulated data were used to illustrate the technique's capabilities with noise levels typical of those encountered in either PET or SPECT. Dynamic datasets were constructed, based on kinetic parameters for fluoro-deoxy-glucose (FDG) and use of either a full ring detector or rotating detector acquisition. For the rotating detector, use of the interpolation scheme provided reconstructed dynamic images with reduced artefacts compared to unprocessed data or use of linear interpolation. Estimates for the metabolic rate of glucose had similar bias to those obtained from a full ring detector.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10048855/
Quantification of 11C-Laniquidar Kinetics in the Brain,"Femke E Froklage, Ronald Boellaard, Esther Bakker, N Harry Hendrikse, Jaap C Reijneveld, Robert C Schuit, Albert D Windhorst, Patrick Schober, Bart N M van Berckel, Adriaan A Lammertsma, Andrey Postnov","Overexpression of the multidrug efflux transport P-glycoprotein may play an important role in pharmacoresistance. (11)C-laniquidar is a newly developed tracer of P-glycoprotein expression. The aim of this study was to develop a pharmacokinetic model for quantification of (11)C-laniquidar uptake and to assess its test-retest variability.

Methods: Two (test-retest) dynamic (11)C-laniquidar PET scans were obtained in 8 healthy subjects. Plasma input functions were obtained using online arterial blood sampling with metabolite corrections derived from manual samples. Coregistered T1 MR images were used for region-of-interest definition. Time-activity curves were analyzed using various plasma input compartmental models.

Results: (11)C-laniquidar was metabolized rapidly, with a parent plasma fraction of 50% at 10 min after tracer injection. In addition, the first-pass extraction of (11)C-laniquidar was low. (11)C-laniquidar time-activity curves were best fitted to an irreversible single-tissue compartment (1T1K) model using conventional models. Nevertheless, significantly better fits were obtained using 2 parallel single-tissue compartments, one for parent tracer and the other for labeled metabolites (dual-input model). Robust K1 results were also obtained by fitting the first 5 min of PET data to the 1T1K model, at least when 60-min plasma input data were used. For both models, the test-retest variability of (11)C-laniquidar rate constant for transfer from arterial plasma to tissue (K1) was approximately 19%.

Conclusion: The accurate quantification of (11)C-laniquidar kinetics in the brain is hampered by its fast metabolism and the likelihood that labeled metabolites enter the brain. Best fits for the entire 60 min of data were obtained using a dual-input model, accounting for uptake of (11)C-laniquidar and its labeled metabolites. Alternatively, K1 could be obtained from a 5-min scan using a standard 1T1K model. In both cases, the test-retest variability of K1 was approximately 19%.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26294297/
Evaluation of three quinoline-carboxamide derivatives as potential radioligands for the in vivo pet imaging of neurodegeneration,"S Belloli, R M Moresco, M Matarrese, G Biella, F Sanvito, P Simonelli, E Turolla, S Olivieri, A Cappelli, S Vomero, M Galli-Kienle, F Fazio","The peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors (PBRs) are only minimally expressed in normal brain parenchyma, where they are primarily localized in glial cells. Their basal expression rises in different neurodegenerative disorders, due to the presence of infiltrating inflammatory cells and activated microglia. [11C]PK11195, a selective PBR antagonist, has been used for the in vivo PET monitoring of neurodegeneration in clinical observations. We recently developed and labeled with carbon-11 three new carboxamide derivatives: [11C]VC193M, [11C]VC195 and [11C]VC198M. Aim of this study was to evaluate these ligands for the in vivo measuring of PBRs expression in neurodegenerations and compare their kinetic behavior with that of the reference tracer [11C]PK11195. Radioligands were evaluated in a preclinical model of Huntington's disease consisting in the monolateral striatal injection of quinolinic acid (QA). Activated microglia and astrocytic gliosis was present only within the affected striatum. A concomitant increase in radioactivity accumulation was observed for all the tracers examined (P<0.01). Among the new compounds, [11C]VC195 showed higher levels of lesioned/unlesioned striatum ratios (3.28+/-0.44), in comparison with [11C]VC193M and [11C]VC198M (2.69+/-0.53 and 1.52+/-0.36, respectively), but slightly inferior to that observed for [11C]PK11195 (3.76+/-1.41).In conclusion, the results of the study indicate that [11C]VC195 is a promising candidate for in vivo PET monitoring of neurodegenerative processes but its in vivo behavior overlap that of [11C]PK11195.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14687608/
The Importance of Time-of-Flight Reconstruction and Point Spread Modeling in the Measurement of Myocardial Blood Flow Parameters,James A Case,"Purpose of review: Absolute quantitation of myocardial blood flow has been recognized as one of the most important advances in nuclear cardiology. The addition of absolute myocardial blood flow quantitation has had a significant impact on the determination of normalcy, artifact/defect differentiation, and the true extent of coronary artery disease in patients with known or suspected coronary disease. Time-of-flight reconstruction and point spread function modeling of the potential to greatly improve resolution and signal to background. This combined with absolute blood flow measurements could improve the reliability of regional blood flow estimates and overall image quality.

Recent findings: Recent publications have demonstrated that time-of-flight reconstruction can have an impact on the amount of spillover between the blood pool ROI and the myocardial regions. This may necessitate changes to kinetic models; however, these changes if implemented correctly may result in improved accuracy and reproducibility of blood flow estimates. This may also have the benefit of assessing blood flow in the microvasculature using newer F-18 labeled blood flow tracers. Time of flight and point spread function modeling represent significant improvements in the accuracy and quality of reconstructed myocardial perfusion PET images. This may also have significant implications for the reliability of blood flow estimates. To achieve these benefits, attention must be given to blood flow models to ensure that they have been correctly optimized for the scanner-specific time-of-flight reconstruction properties.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34081208/
"Evaluation of (2S,4S)-4-[18F]FEBGln as a Positron Emission Tomography Tracer for Tumor Imaging","Yong Huang, Yajing Liu, Chengze Li, Zhongjing Li, Hualong Chen, Lu Zhang, Ying Liang, Zehui Wu","Glutamine metabolism-related tracers have the potential to visualize numerous tumors because glutamine is the second largest source of energy for tumors. (2S,4S)-4-[18F]FEBGln was designed by introducing [18F]fluoroethoxy benzyl on carbon-4 of glutamine. The aim of this study was to investigate the pharmacokinetic properties and tumor positron emission tomography (PET) imaging characteristics of (2S,4S)-4-[18F]FEBGln in detail. The biodistribution results of nude mice bearing MCF-7 tumor showed that (2S,4S)-4-[18F]FEBGln had high initial tumor uptake, and a fast clearance rate, resulting in a high tumor-to-muscle ratio at 30 min postinjection. There was no obvious defluorinationin vivo. The micro-PET-CT imaging results of (2S,4S)-4-[18F]FEBGln orthotopic MCF-7 tumor-bearing nude mice were consistent with the biological distribution results. Compared with (2S,4R)-4-[18F]FGln, (2S,4S)-4-[18F]FEBGln showed poor tumor retention, but its clearance in normal tissues was also fast, so it had better PET image contrast than the former. Unlike poor retention in MCF-7-bearing nude mice, (2S,4S)-4-[18F]FEBGln has good retention in NCI-h1975 and 22Rv1 tumor models. Since (2S,4S)-4-[18F]FEBGln has low uptake in normal lungs and high uptake in the bladder, it is expected to be used in the accurate diagnosis of lung cancer but cannot accurately determine prostate cancer. Consistent with the advantages of radiolabeled amino acids in the application of brain tumors, (2S,4S)-4-[18F]FEBGln accurately diagnoses U87MG glioma with higher contrast than [18F]FET and [18F]FDG, and there is a correlation between (2S,4S)-4-[18F]FEBGln uptake and tumor growth cycle. Further kinetic model analysis showed that (2S,4S)-4-[18F]FEBGln was similar to (2S,4R)-4-[18F]FGln, conforming to the one-compartment model and the Logan graphical model, and was expected to assess the size of the glutamine pool of the tumor. Therefore, (2S,4S)-4-[18F]FEBGln is expected to provide a strong imaging basis for the diagnosis, formulation of personalized plans, and efficacy evaluation of glioma, lung cancer, and breast cancer.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37647563/
"Determination of in vivo Bmax and Kd for 11C-GR103545, an agonist PET tracer for κ-opioid receptors: a study in nonhuman primates","Giampaolo Tomasi, Nabeel Nabulsi, Ming-Qiang Zheng, David Weinzimmer, Jim Ropchan, Laura Blumberg, Clive Brown-Proctor, Yu-Shin Ding, Richard E Carson, Yiyun Huang","The κ-opioid receptors (KOR) are involved in mood disorders and addictive conditions. In vivo imaging studies of this receptor in humans have not been reported because of the lack of a selective ligand. We used a recently developed selective KOR agonist tracer, (11)C-GR103545, and performed a study in rhesus monkeys to estimate the in vivo receptor concentration (Bmax) and dissociation equilibrium constant (Kd).

Methods: Four rhesus monkeys underwent 12 scans with (11)C-GR103545 on a PET scanner under baseline and self-blocking conditions. The injected mass was 0.042 ± 0.014 μg/kg for the baseline scans and ranged from 0.16 to 0.3 μg/kg for the self-blocking scans. The radiotracer was administered in a bolus-plus-infusion protocol, and cerebellum was used as the reference region in kinetic analysis. Binding potential (BPND) values were computed as [(CROI/CREF) - 1], where CROI and CREF are the mean of the radioactivity concentrations from 90 to 120 min after tracer administration in a given region of interest (ROI) and in the cerebellum. In 6 scans, arterial input functions and free fraction in plasma (fp) were measured. In addition, a 2-tissue-compartment model was used to compute the volume of distribution in the cerebellum (VT_REF), which was then used to estimate the free-to-nondisplaceable concentration ratio (fND) as fp/VT_REF. A Scatchard plot was used to estimate Bmax, and Kd(ND) = Kd/fND, the Kd value with respect to the cerebellar concentration. Individual data were first analyzed separately and then pooled together. When Kd(ND) was allowed to vary among ROIs, results were variable; therefore, Kd(ND) was constrained to be constant across ROIs, whereas Bmax was allowed to be ROI-dependent and animal-dependent.

Results: A global estimate of 1.72 nM was obtained for Kd(ND). Estimated Bmax ranged from 0.3 to 6.1 nM across ROIs and animals. The Kd estimate of 0.048 nM, obtained by correcting Kd(ND) by the factor fND, was in good agreement with the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.018 nM determined from functional assays in rabbit vas deferens and inhibition constant (Ki) of 0.02 nM measured in radioligand competition assays using cloned human receptors. On the basis of these data, a suitable tracer dose of 0.02 μg/kg was selected for use in humans.

Conclusion: The use of a bolus-plus-infusion protocol with the KOR agonist tracer (11)C-GR103545 permitted the successful estimation of Bmax and Kd(ND) in vivo. On the basis of the estimated Kd value, a tracer dose of 1.4 μg (3.38 nmol) for an average body weight of 70 kg was chosen as the mass dose limit in human studies using this novel agonist radiotracer.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23424192/
Unmixing dynamic PET images with variable specific binding kinetics,"Yanna Cruz Cavalcanti, Thomas Oberlin, Nicolas Dobigeon, Simon Stute, Maria Ribeiro, Clovis Tauber","To analyze dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) images, various generic multivariate data analysis techniques have been considered in the literature, such as principal component analysis (PCA), independent component analysis (ICA), factor analysis and nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF). Nevertheless, these conventional approaches neglect any possible nonlinear variations in the time activity curves describing the kinetic behavior of tissues with specific binding, which limits their ability to recover a reliable, understandable and interpretable description of the data. This paper proposes an alternative analysis paradigm that accounts for spatial fluctuations in the exchange rate of the tracer between a free compartment and a specifically bound ligand compartment. The method relies on the concept of linear unmixing, usually applied on the hyperspectral domain, which combines NMF with a sum-to-one constraint that ensures an exhaustive description of the mixtures. The spatial variability of the signature corresponding to the specific binding tissue is explicitly modeled through a perturbed component. The performance of the method is assessed on both synthetic and real data and is shown to compete favorably when compared to other conventional analysis methods.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30121510/
Kinetic modeling of [11C]raclopride: combined PET-microdialysis studies,"C J Endres, B S Kolachana, R C Saunders, T Su, D Weinberger, A Breier, W C Eckelman, R E Carson","The in vivo binding of D2 receptor ligands can be affected by agents that alter the concentration of endogenous dopamine. To define a more explicit relation between dopamine and D2 receptor binding, the conventional compartment model for reversible ligands has been extended to account for a time-varying dopamine pulse. This model was tested with [11C]raclopride positron emission tomography and dopamine microdialysis data that were acquired simultaneously in rhesus monkeys. The microdialysis data were incorporated into the model assuming a proportional relation to synaptic dopamine. Positron emission tomography studies used a bolus-plus-infusion tracer delivery with amphetamine given at 40 minutes to induce dopamine release. The extended model described the entire striatal time-activity curve, including the decrease in radioactivity concentration after an amphetamine-induced dopamine pulse. Based on these results, simulation studies were performed using the extended model. The simulation studies showed that the percent decrease in specific binding after amphetamine measured with the bolus-plus-infusion protocol correlates well with the integral of the postamphetamine dopamine pulse. This suggests that changes in specific binding observed in studies in humans can be interpreted as being linearly proportional to the integral of the amphetamine-induced dopamine pulse.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9307606/
Enhanced parameter estimation from noisy PET data: Part II--evaluation,"Amy Marcinkowski, Dominick Layfield, Nora Tgavalekos, Jose G Venegas","Rationale and objectives: Positron emission tomography (PET) is a minimally invasive imaging modality that provides three-dimensional distribution data for a radioactive tracer concentration within the body. Local functional parameters are estimated from these images by fitting tracer kinetic data with mathematical models. However, in some applications, the reliability of parameter estimates may be hindered by the presence of noise. In the accompanying report in this issue of Academic Radiology, a novel method using principal component analysis (PCA) was presented and used for deriving parametric images of lung function from imaged tracer kinetics of intravenously injected nitrogen 13 (13NN) in saline solution. The PCA method averages 13NN concentrations from groups of voxels (volume elements) selected for their similarity in kinetics, rather than their spatial proximity. The goal of this study is to conduct a Monte Carlo simulation to evaluate the robustness to noise of parameters derived by means of the PCA method.

Materials and methods: This evaluation involved: (1) generating ""noise-free"" synthetic PET images from experimental PET data, (2) adding noise to these images, (3) applying the PCA method to yield parametric images, and (4) comparing these parametric images with original noise-free images.

Results: Local parameters recovered by using the PCA method deviated from noise-free parameters on average by less than 1% for up to 32-fold of expected noise levels. These deviations were much less than those (>10%) recovered by using a direct curve-fitting method.

Conclusion: The novel PCA approach provides robust parametric lung functional images while preserving the spatial resolution of the original images.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16253857/
Behavioral neuroimaging in birds using PET,"Michael Salerno, Elizabeth Ferrer, Shouyi Wei, Xiang Li, Wenrong Gao, David Ouellette, Amy Balanoff, Paul Vaska","Background: Birds comprise the most diverse group of terrestrial vertebrates. This success likely is related to the evolution of powered flight over 75 mya. Modern approaches for studying brain function, however, have yet to be fully adapted and applied to birds, especially as they relate to specific behaviors including flight. New method: We have developed a comprehensive set of in vivo experimental methods utilizing PET imaging with F-18 labeled fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) to study regional changes in metabolism specifically related to flight, yet applicable to other behaviors as well. It incorporates approaches for selection of species, behavioral/imaging paradigm, animal preparation, radiotracer injection route, image quantification, and image analysis via an enhanced brain atlas. We also carried out preliminary modeling studies to better understand tracer kinetics.

Results: The methods were successful in identifying brain regions statistically associated with flight using only 8 animals. Peak brain uptake of FDG between birds and rodents is similar despite much higher blood glucose levels in birds. We also confirmed that brain uptake of FDG steadily decreases after the initial peak and provide evidence that it may be related to greater dephosphorylation of FDG phosphate than that observed in mammals. Comparison with existing methods: FDG PET has been used in only a few studies of the bird brain. We introduce a new species, more realistic flight behavior, paired (test/retest) design, and improved quantification and analysis approaches.

Conclusions: The proposed imaging protocol is non-invasive yet sensitive to regional metabolic changes in the bird brain related to behavior.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30710608/
Noninvasive evaluation of sympathetic nervous system in human heart by positron emission tomography,"M Schwaiger, V Kalff, K Rosenspire, M S Haka, E Molina, G D Hutchins, M Deeb, E Wolfe Jr, D M Wieland","The noninvasive functional characterization of the cardiac sympathetic nervous system by imaging techniques may provide important pathophysiological information in various cardiac disease states. Hydroxyephedrine labeled with carbon 11 has been developed as a new catecholamine analogue to be used in the in vivo evaluation of presynaptic adrenergic nerve terminals by positron emission tomography (PET). To determine the feasibility of this imaging approach in the human heart, six normal volunteers and five patients with recent cardiac transplants underwent dynamic PET imaging after intravenous injection of 20 mCi [11C]hydroxyephedrine. Blood and myocardial tracer kinetics were assessed using a regions-of-interest approach. In normal volunteers, blood 11C activity cleared rapidly, whereas myocardium retained 11C activity with a long tissue half-life. Relative tracer retention in the myocardium averaged 79 +/- 31% of peak activity at 60 minutes after tracer injection. The heart-to-blood 11C activity ratio exceeded 6:1 as soon as 30 minutes after tracer injection, yielding excellent image quality. Little regional variation of tracer retention was observed, indicating homogeneous sympathetic innervation throughout the left ventricle. In the transplant recipients, myocardial [11C]hydroxyephedrine retention at 60 minutes was significantly less (-82%) than that of normal volunteers, indicating only little non-neuronal binding of the tracer in the denervated human heart. Thus, [11C]hydroxyephedrine, in combination with dynamic PET imaging, allows the noninvasive delineation of myocardial adrenergic nerve terminals. Tracer kinetic modeling may permit quantitative assessment of myocardial catecholamine uptake, which will in turn provide insights into the effects of various disease processes on the neuronal integrity of the heart.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2372893/
Evaluation of the skeletal kinetics of fluorine-18-fluoride ion with PET,"R A Hawkins, Y Choi, S C Huang, C K Hoh, M Dahlbom, C Schiepers, N Satyamurthy, J R Barrio, M E Phelps","To evaluate the feasibility of quantitatively assessing regional skeletal fluoride uptake in humans in focal and generalized bone disease, we investigated the skeletal kinetics of [18F]fluoride ion with dynamic PET imaging. Dynamic image sets were acquired over a 60-min interval in a multiplane PET device, and input functions (plasma 18F time-activity curves) were measured directly from arterialized blood and, in some cases, determined from image-derived left ventricular cavity activity measurements. Our results indicate: 1. A steady-state ratio of [18F]fluoride ion concentration in plasma to whole blood greater than unity (1.23 for plasma to directly assayed whole blood and 1.44 for plasma to left ventricular cavity imaged concentrations. This concentration difference produces a scaling factor that must be considered when using image derived or directly measured input functions. 2. The preferred tracer kinetic model configuration for [18F]fluoride ion skeletal kinetics is a three compartment model that includes a ""bound"" and ""unbound"" bone [18F]fluoride ion compartment. 3. The rate constant for forward transport of [18F]fluoride ion from plasma to the extravascular space of bone (K1) and the regional blood volume parameter generate estimates of bone blood flow and vascular volume, respectively, that are in the physiologic range of reported for mammals. Estimates of the uptake constant for fluoride in bone, using nonlinear regression (KNLR = 0.0360 +/- 0.0064 ml/min/ml), are in very good agreement with an estimate of the same parameter obtained with Patlak graphical analysis (KPAT = 0.0355 +/- 0.0061 ml/min/ml). 4. Generating parametric images of KPAT facilitates quantification of regional bone [18F]fluoride ion kinetics. The method is computationally practical, and, with either the parametric imaging approach or with standard region of interest analysis, can be used to generate quantitative estimates of fluoride uptake (a ""bone metabolic index"") in focal skeletal regions or in more generalized distributions.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1569473/
Quantification of muscarinic cholinergic receptors with [11C]NMPB and positron emission tomography: method development and differentiation of tracer delivery from receptor binding,"J K Zubieta, R A Koeppe, G K Mulholland, D E Kuhl, K A Frey","Quantification of human brain muscarinic cholinergic receptors was investigated with the use of [11C]N-methyl-4-piperidyl benzylate (NMPB) and positron emission tomography (PET). Whole-brain uptake of NMPB at 90 to 110 minutes after intravenous injection was approximately 10% of the administered dose. The initial cerebral distribution of NMPB corresponded to the pattern of cerebral perfusion; however, at progressively longer postinjection intervals, regional distinctions consistent with muscarinic receptor binding were evident: activity at 90 to 110 minutes postinjection was highest in the striatum and cerebral cortex, intermediate in the thalamus and pons, and lowest in the cerebellum. After the development of a chromatographic system for isolation of authentic [11C]NMPB in plasma, tracer kinetic modeling was used to estimate receptor binding from the cerebral and arterial plasma tracer time-courses. Ligand transport rate and receptor-binding estimates were obtained with the use of compartmental models and analytical methods of varying complexity, including a two-parameter pixel-by-pixel-weighted integral approach and regional least-squares curve-fitting analyses employing both two- and three-compartment model configurations. In test-retest experiments, precision of the methods and their abilities to distinguish altered ligand delivery from binding in occipital cortex during an audiovisual presentation were evaluated. Visual stimulation increased the occipital blood-to-brain NMPB transport rate by 25% to 46% in estimates arising from the various approaches. Weighted integral analyses resulted in lowest apparent transport changes and in a concomitant trend toward apparent binding increases during visual activation. The regional least-squares procedures were superior to the pixel-by-pixel method in isolating the effects of altered tracer delivery from receptor-binding estimates, indicating larger transport effects and unaltered binding. Precision was best (less than 10% test-retest differences) for the weighted integral analyses and was somewhat lower in the least-squares analyses (10-25% differences). The authors conclude that pixel-by-pixel-weighted integral analyses of NMPB distribution introduce transport biases into receptor-binding estimates. Similar confounding effects also are predicted in noncompartmental analyses of delayed radiotracer distribution. The use of regional nonlinear least-squares fitting to two- and three-compartment models, although more labor intensive, provides accurate distinction of receptor-binding estimates from tracer delivery with acceptable precision in both intra- and intersubject comparisons.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9626186/
"First-in-Human Evaluation of 18F-SynVesT-1, a Radioligand for PET Imaging of Synaptic Vesicle Glycoprotein 2A","Mika Naganawa, Songye Li, Nabeel Nabulsi, Shannan Henry, Ming-Qiang Zheng, Richard Pracitto, Zhengxin Cai, Hong Gao, Michael Kapinos, David Labaree, David Matuskey, Yiyun Huang, Richard E Carson","The use of synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A radiotracers with PET imaging could provide a way to measure synaptic density quantitatively in living humans.11C-UCB-J ((R)-1-((3-(11C-methyl-11C)pyridin-4-yl)methyl)-4-(3,4,5-trifluorophenyl)pyrrolidin-2-one), previously developed and assessed in nonhuman primates and humans, showed excellent kinetic properties as a PET radioligand. However, it is labeled with the short half-life isotope11C. We developed a new tracer, an18F-labeled difluoro-analog of UCB-J (18F-SynVesT-1, also known as18F-SDM-8), which displayed favorable properties in monkeys. The purpose of this first-in-human study was to assess the kinetic and binding properties of18F-SynVesT-1 and compare with11C-UCB-J.Methods:Eight healthy volunteers participated in a baseline study of18F-SynVesT-1. Four of these subjects were also scanned after a blocking dose of the antiepileptic drug levetiracetam (20 mg/kg). Metabolite-corrected arterial input functions were measured. Regional time-activity curves were analyzed using 1-tissue-compartment (1TC) and 2-tissue-compartment (2TC) models and multilinear analysis 1 to compute total distribution volume (VT) and binding potential (BPND). The centrum semiovale was used as a reference region. The Lassen plot was applied to compute levetiracetam occupancy and nondisplaceable distribution volume. SUV ratio-1 (SUVR-1) over several time windows was compared withBPNDResults:Regional time-activity curves were fitted better with the 2TC model than the 1TC model, but 2TCVTestimates were unstable. The 1TCVTvalues matched well with those from the 2TC model (excluding the unstable values). Thus, 1TC was judged as the most useful model for quantitative analysis of18F-SynVesT-1 imaging data. The minimum scan time for stableVTmeasurement was 60 min. The rank order ofVTandBPNDwas similar between18F-SynVesT-1 and11C-UCB-J. RegionalVTwas slightly higher for11C-UCB-J, butBPNDwas higher for18F-SynVesT-1, though these differences were not significant.

Bayesian Estimation of the ntPET Model in Single-Scan Competition PET Studies,"Zacharie Irace, Inés Mérida, Jérôme Redouté, Clara Fonteneau, Marie-Françoise Suaud-Chagny, Jérôme Brunelin, Benjamin Vidal, Luc Zimmer, Anthonin Reilhac, Nicolas Costes","This paper proposes an innovative method, named b-ntPET, for solving a competition model in PET. The model is built upon the state-of-the-art method called lp-ntPET. It consists in identifying the parameters of the PET kinetic model relative to a reference region that rule the steady state exchanges, together with the identification of four additional parameters defining a displacement curve caused by an endogenous neurotransmitter discharge, or by a competing injected drug targeting the same receptors as the PET tracer. The resolution process of lp-ntPET is however suboptimal due to the use of discretized basis functions, and is very sensitive to noise, limiting its sensitivity and accuracy. Contrary to the original method, our proposed resolution approach first estimates the probability distribution of the unknown parameters using Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo sampling, distributions from which the estimates are then inferred. In addition, and for increased robustness, the noise level is jointly estimated with the parameters of the model. Finally, the resolution is formulated in a Bayesian framework, allowing the introduction of prior knowledge on the parameters to guide the estimation process toward realistic solutions. The performance of our method was first assessed and compared head-to-head with the reference method lp-ntPET using well-controlled realistic simulated data. The results showed that the b-ntPET method is substantially more robust to noise and much more sensitive and accurate than lp-ntPET. We then applied the model to experimental animal data acquired in pharmacological challenge studies and human data with endogenous releases induced by transcranial direct current stimulation. In the drug challenge experiment on cats using [18F]MPPF, a serotoninergic 1A antagonist radioligand, b-ntPET measured a dose response associated with the amount of the challenged injected concurrent 5-HT1A agonist, where lp-ntPET failed. In human [11C]raclopride experiment, contrary to lp-ntPET, b-ntPET successfully detected significant endogenous dopamine releases induced by the stimulation. In conclusion, our results showed that the proposed method b-ntPET has similar performance to lp-ntPET for detecting displacements, but with higher resistance to noise and better robustness to various experimental contexts. These improvements lead to the possibility of detecting and characterizing dynamic drug occupancy from a single PET scan more efficiently.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32508679/
[Positron emission tomography: foundations and applications],"B Gulyás, L Trón, L Csiba, O Esik, J Pálinkás, Z Szabó","Positron emission tomography (PET) is a non-invasive biomedical imaging technique whereby the distribution of biological tracer molecules, labelled by positron emitting isotopes, in the living body can be studied quantitatively. As theoretically an metabolically active molecule can be labelled, the technique is applicable to the measurement of any biochemical or physiological process in proper anatomical context. The introduction of PET has revolutionised the exploration of normal physiological functions. With the help of technique, among others, anatomical structures underlying mental functions can be localised in the human brain, the receptor architecture of the nervous system can be mapped, or the kinetics of pharmacons can be properly measured and modelled. In the clinical practice, PET has proven to be a uniquely useful diagnostic technique in neurology, psychiatry, cardiology, and oncology in establishing primary diagnosis and differential diagnosis, designing therapeutic interventions as well as assessing their efficacy. Hungary's and Central European region's first PET center has been established at the University Medical School in Debrecen.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8927318/
Spectral analysis: principle and clinical applications,Kenya Murase,"This review article describes the principle and clinical applications of spectral analysis. Spectral analysis provides a spectrum of the kinetic components which are involved in the regional uptake and partitioning of tracer from the blood to the tissue. This technique allows the tissue impulse response function to be derived with minimal modeling assumptions. Spectral analysis makes no a priori assumptions regarding the number of compartments or components required to describe the time course of tracer in the tissue. Spectral analysis can be applied to various dynamic data acquired by planar scintigraphy, single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) or positron emission tomography (PET) as an alternative approach to compartment analysis. This analysis appears to be clinically useful, because it not only facilitates the interpretation of dynamic scintigraphic, SPECT or PET data, but also simplifies comparisons between regions and between subjects.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14575374/
Feasibility and robustness of dynamic 18F-FET PET based tracer kinetic models applied to patients with recurrent high-grade glioma prior to carbon ion irradiation,"Charlotte Debus, Ali Afshar-Oromieh, Ralf Floca, Michael Ingrisch, Maximilian Knoll, Jürgen Debus, Uwe Haberkorn, Amir Abdollahi","The aim of this study was to analyze the robustness and diagnostic value of different compartment models for dynamic18F-FET PET in recurrent high-grade glioma (HGG). Dynamic18F-FET PET data of patients with recurrent WHO grade III (n:7) and WHO grade IV (n: 9) tumors undergoing re-irradiation with carbon ions were analyzed by voxelwise fitting of the time-activity curves with a simplified and an extended one-tissue compartment model (1TCM) and a two-tissue compartment model (2TCM), respectively. A simulation study was conducted to assess robustness and precision of the 2TCM. Parameter maps showed enhanced detail on tumor substructure. Neglecting the blood volume VBin the 1TCM yields insufficient results. Parameter K1from both 1TCM and 2TCM showed correlation with overall patient survival after carbon ion irradiation (p = 0.043 and 0.036, respectively). The 2TCM yields realistic estimates for tumor blood volume, which was found to be significantly higher in WHO IV compared to WHO III (p = 0.031). Simulations on the 2TCM showed that K1yields good accuracy and robustness while k2showed lowest stability of all parameters. The 1TCM provides the best compromise between parameter stability and model accuracy; however application of the 2TCM is still feasible and provides a more accurate representation of tracer-kinetics at the cost of reduced robustness. Detailed tracer kinetic analysis of18F-FET PET with compartment models holds valuable information on tumor substructures and provides additional diagnostic and prognostic value.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30283013/

[11C]UCB-J binds to synaptic vesicle 2A (SV2A) transmembrane protein located in secretory vesicles. We aimed to assess [11C]UCB-J PET as an in vivo biomarker of regional cerebral synaptic SV2A density in rat lesion models of neurodegeneration. Healthy anesthetized rats had [11C]UCB-J PET and arterial blood sampling. We compared different models describing [11C]UCB-J brain uptake kinetics to determine its regional distribution. Blocking studies were performed with levetiracetam (LEV), an antiepileptic SV2A antagonist. Tracer binding was measured in rodent unilateral acute lesion models of Parkinsonism and Huntington's disease, induced with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) and quinolinic acid (QA), respectively. [3H]UCB-J autoradiography was performed in postmortem tissue. Rat brain showed high and fast [11C]UCB-J uptake and washout with up to 80% blockade by LEV. [11C]UCB-J PET showed a 6.2% decrease in ipsilateral striatal SV2A binding after 6-OHDA and 39.3% and 55.1% decreases after moderate and high dose QA confirmed by autoradiography.

Combined use of (18)F-FDG and (18)F-FMISO in unresectable non-small cell lung cancer patients planned for radiotherapy: a dynamic PET/CT study,"Christos Sachpekidis, Christian Thieke, Vasileios Askoxylakis, Nils H Nicolay, Peter E Huber, Michael Thomas, Georgia Dimitrakopoulou, Juergen Debus, Uwe Haberkorn, Antonia Dimitrakopoulou-Strauss","Aim of this study was to evaluate and compare, by means of dynamic and static PET/CT, the distribution patterns and pharmacokinetics of fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) and of fluorine-18-fluoromisonidazole ((18)F-FMISO) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients scheduled for intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). Thirteen patients suffering from inoperable stage III NSCLC underwent PET/CTs with (18)F-FDG and (18)F-FMISO for tumor metabolism and hypoxia assessment accordingly. Evaluation of PET/CT studies was based on visual analysis, semi-quantitative (SUV) calculations and absolute quantitative estimations, after application of a two-tissue compartment model and a non-compartmental approach. (18)F-FDG PET/CT revealed all thirteen primary lung tumors as sites of increased (18)F-FDG uptake. Six patients demonstrated also in total 43 (18)F-FDG avid metastases; these patients were excluded from radiotherapy. (18)F-MISO PET/CT demonstrated 12/13 primary lung tumors with faint tracer uptake. Only one tumor was clearly (18)F-FMISO avid, (SUVaverage = 3.4, SUVmax = 5.0). Mean values for (18)F-FDG, as derived from dPET/CT data, were SUVaverage = 8.9, SUVmax = 15.1, K1 = 0.23, k2 = 0.53, k3 = 0.17, k4 = 0.02, influx = 0.05 and fractal dimension (FD) = 1.25 for the primary tumors.

No statistically significant correlation was observed between the two tracers. (18)F-FDG PET/CT changed therapy management in six patients, by excluding them from planned IMRT. (18)F-FMISO PET/CT revealed absence of significant tracer uptake in the majority of the (18)F-FDG avid NSCLCs. Lack of correlation between the two tracers' kinetics indicates that they reflect different molecular mechanisms and implies the discordance between increased glycolysis and hypoxia in the malignancy.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25973334/
Kinetic analysis of 52Fe-labelled iron(III) hydroxide-sucrose complex following bolus administration using positron emission tomography,"S Beshara, H Lundqvist, J Sundin, M Lubberink, V Tolmachev, S Valind, G Antoni, B Långström, B G Danielson","Kinetic analysis of a single intravenous injection of 100 mg iron(III) hydroxide-sucrose complex (Venofer) mixed with 52Fe(III) hydroxide-sucrose as a tracer was followed for 3-6 h in four generally anaesthetized, artificially ventilated minipigs using positron emission tomography (PET). The amount of injected radioactivity ranged from 30 to 200 MBq. Blood radioactivity, measured by PET in the left ventricle of the heart, displayed a fast clearance phase followed by a slow one. In the liver and bone marrow a fast radioactivity uptake occurred during the first 30 min, followed by a slower steady increase. In the liver a slight decrease in radioactivity uptake was noted by the end of the study. A kinetic analysis using a three-compartment (namely blood pool, reversible and irreversible tissue pools) model showed a fairly high distribution volume in the liver as compared with the bone marrow. In conclusion, the pharmacokinetics of the injected complex was clearly visualized with the PET technique. The organs of particular interest, namely the heart (for blood kinetics), liver and bone marrow could all be viewed by a single setting of a PET tomograph with an axial field of view of 10 cm. The half-life (T1/2) of 52Fe (8.3 h) enables a detailed kinetic study up to 24 h. A novel method was introduced to verify the actual 52Fe contribution to the PET images by removing the interfering radioactive daughter 52mMn positron emissions. The kinetic data fitted the three-compartment model, from which rate constants could be obtained for iron transfer from the blood to a pool of iron in bone marrow or liver to which it was bound during the study period. In addition, there was a reversible tissue pool of iron, which in the liver slowly equilibrated with the blood, to give a net efflux from the liver some hours after i.v. administration. The liver uptake showed a relatively long distribution phase, whereas the injected iron was immediately incorporated into the bone marrow. Various transport mechanisms seem to be involved in the handling of the injected iron complex.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10050710/
Evaluation of [18F]F-TZ3108 for PET Imaging of Metabolic-Associated Fatty Liver Disease,"Peiyi Huang, Zhijun Li, Tukang Peng, Jihua Yang, Lei Bi, Guolong Huang, Yifan Qiu, Min Yang, Peizhen Ye, Mingxing Huang, Hongjun Jin, Liao Sun","Purpose: Sigma-1 receptor (Sig-1R), a chaperone that resides at the mitochondrion-associated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, is an ER stress biomarker. It is thought that ER stress plays a critical role in the progression of metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD). The aim of this study was to evaluate a positron emission tomography (PET) tracer [18F]F-TZ3108 targeting Sig-1R for MAFLD.

Procedures: The mouse model of MAFLD was established by feeding high-fat diet (HFD) for 12 weeks. Dynamic (0-60 min) PET/CT scans were performed after intravenous injection of 2-deoxy-2[18F]fluoro-D-glucose ([18F]-FDG) and [18F]F-TZ3108. Tracer kinetic modeling was performed for quantification of the PET/CT imaging of the liver. Post-PET biodistribution, the liver tissue western blotting (WB), and immunofluorescence (IF) were performed to compare the expression of Sig-1R levels in the organs harvested from both MAFLD and age-matched control mice.

Results: The micro PET/CT imaging revealed a significantly decreased uptake of [18F]F-TZ3108 in the livers of the MAFLD group compared to the healthy controls, while the uptake of [18F]-FDG in the livers was not significantly different between the two groups. Based on the tracer kinetic modeling, the binding disassociate rate (k4) for [18F]F-TZ3108 was significantly increased in MAFLD group compared to healthy controls. The volume distribution (VT), and the non-displacement binding potential (BPND) revealed significantly decrease in MAFLD compared to healthy controls respectively. The post-PET biodistribution (%ID/g) of [18F]F-TZ3108 in the livers of MAFLD mice was significantly reduced nearly twofold than that in the livers of control mice. WB and IF experiments further confirmed the reduction of Sig-1R expression in the MAFLD group.

Conclusions: The expression of Sig-1R in the liver, measured by the PET tracer, [18F]F-TZ3108, was significantly decreased in mouse model of MAFLD. The [18F]F-TZ3108 PET/CT imaging may provide a novel means of visualization for ER stress in MAFLD or other diseases in vivo.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35705779/
[(11)C]5-HTP and microPET are not suitable for pharmacodynamic studies in the rodent brain,"Anniek K D Visser, Nisha K Ramakrishnan, Antoon T M Willemsen, Valentina Di Gialleonardo, Erik F J de Vries, Ido P Kema, Rudi A J O Dierckx, Aren van Waarde","The PET tracer [(11)C]5-hydroxytryptophan ([(11)C]5-HTP), which is converted to [(11)C]5-hydroxytryptamine ([(11)C]5-HT) by aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AADC), is thought to measure 5-HT synthesis rates. But can we measure these synthesis rates by kinetic modeling of [(11)C]5-HTP in rat? Male rats were scanned with [(11)C]5-HTP (60 minutes) after different treatments. Scans included arterial blood sampling and metabolite analysis. 5-HT synthesis rates were calculated by a two-tissue compartment model (2TCM) with irreversible tracer trapping or Patlak analysis. Carbidopa (inhibitor peripheral AADC) dose-dependently increased [(11)C]5-HTP brain uptake, but did not influence 2TCM parameters. Therefore, 10 mg/kg carbidopa was applied in all subsequent study groups. These groups included treatment with NSD 1015 (general AADC inhibitor) or p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA, inhibitor of tryptophan hydroxylase, TPH). In addition, the effect of a low-tryptophan (Trp) diet was investigated. NSD 1015 or Trp depletion did not affect any model parameters, but PCPA reduced [(11)C]5-HTP uptake, and the k3. This was unexpected as NSD 1015 directly inhibits the enzyme converting [(11)C]5-HTP to [(11)C]5-HT, suggesting that trapping of radioactivity does not distinguish between parent tracer and its metabolites. As different results have been acquired in monkeys and humans, [(11)C]5-HTP-PET may be suitable for measuring 5-HT synthesis in primates, but not in rodents.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24084697/
"Radiolabeled neuronal nitric oxide synthase inhibitors: synthesis, in vivo evaluation, and primate PET studies","M G Pomper, J L Musachio, U Scheffel, J E Macdonald, D J McCarthy, D W Reif, V L Villemagne, F Yokoi, R F Dannals, D F Wong","The objectives of this study were to synthesize neuronal nitric oxide synthase (NOS-I)-selective imaging agents based on the 2 potent, selective inhibitors AR-R 17443 [N-(4-((2-((phenylmethyl) (methyl)-amino)ethyl)phenyl)-2-thiophenecarboximidamide)] and AR-R 18512 [(N(2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-7-yl)-2-thiophenecarboxim idamide)] in positron-emitting form and to evaluate regional brain uptake in rodents and primates.

Methods: [11C]AR-R 17443 and [11C]AR-R 18512 were produced by N-alkylation of the corresponding desmethyl precursors using [11C]iodomethane. Regional brain uptake of [11C]AR-R 17443 and [11C]AR-R 18512 was assayed in rats and NOS-I knockout mice, and PET was performed in baboons. Tracer kinetic modeling used a 2-compartment plasma and brain tissue model.

Results: Yields of [11C]AR-R 17443 and [11C]AR-R 18512 ranged from 8% to 16% at the end of synthesis, with specific activities of 50-178 GBq/micromol (1,350-4,800 Ci/mmol) at the end of synthesis. In rat cerebellum and cortex at 30 min after injection, [11C]AR-R 17443 showed 1.01 +/- 0.01 and 1.63 +/- 0.12 percentage injected dose per gram (%ID/g) uptake, respectively, whereas [11C]AR-R 18512 showed 0.88 +/- 0.01 and 1.30 +/- 0.07 %ID/g uptake, respectively. Attempts to block tracer uptake by pretreatment with the NOS-I-selective inhibitor 7-nitroindazole or the corresponding unlabeled inhibitor (or desmethyl precursor to AR-R 17443 of similar potency) were unsuccessful. A small but significant (20%) decrease in cerebellar uptake of [11C]AR-R 18512 was present in NOS-I knockout mice compared with control mice. PET of [11C]AR-R 18512 in baboons with concurrent regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) determination before and after administration of blocker showed dose-related decreases in cerebellar uptake that were greater than or equal to decreases in rCBF. Plasma metabolites accounted for 27% of total activity at 30 min after injection. Kinetic modeling of binding potentials revealed a distribution volume of 334 in cerebral blood that dropped 51% after blocker administration.

Conclusion: Rodent studies for [11C]AR-R 17443 and [11C]AR-R 18512 showed little evidence of specific NOS-I binding. In baboons, we detected a higher uptake of [11C]AR-R 18512 in the cerebellum than in the cortex (approximately 5%, accounting for decreased rCBF because of blockade), indicating minimal specific binding. Analogs of higher affinity are likely required if this class of agents is to prove viable for PET.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10945536/
Optimal image sampling schedule for both image-derived input and output functions in PET cardiac studies,"X Li, D Feng, K Chen","Optimal sampling schedule (OSS) design for both image-derived input and output functions in tracer kinetic modeling with positron emission tomography (PET) is investigated. This problem is very important in noninvasive PET dynamic cardiac studies where both the input function, i.e., the plasma time-activity curve (PTAC), and the output function, i.e., the tissue time-activity curve (TTAC), are obtained simultaneously from the same sequence of PET images. The integral PET measurement is used in this study. The spillover correction for the cross contaminations in cardiac studies is incorporated into the OSS design procedure. A new target function based on the D-optimal criterion involving both the input and output sensitivity functions is proposed. The fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) model and a six-parameter PTAC model are used to illustrate the simultaneous OSS design for both the PTAC and TTAC. An OSS design consisting of six different scanning intervals is derived. Computer simulations are performed based on the estimated parameters from real studies to evaluate the effectiveness of the OSS. The double modeling approach is used in parameter estimation to simultaneously estimate the parameters involved. The results have shown that, for a wide range of parameter variations, the OSS is as effective as a conventional sampling schedule (CSS) and comparable parameter estimates can be obtained. Compared with the use of the CSS, the use of the OSS leads to an approximately 70% reduction in the storage space and data processing time.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10875707/
Multi-Tracer Studies of Brain Oxygen and Glucose Metabolism Using a Time-of-Flight Positron Emission Tomography - Computed Tomography Scanner,"John J Lee, Nicholas Metcalf, Tony A Durbin, Jennifer Byers, Kim Casey, Hussain Jafri, Manu S Goyal, Andrei G Vlassenko","The authors have developed a paradigm using positron emission tomography (PET) with multiple radiopharmaceutical tracers that combines measurements of cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (CMRGlc), cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2), cerebral blood flow (CBF), and cerebral blood volume (CBV), culminating in estimates of brain aerobic glycolysis (AG). These in vivo estimates of oxidative and non-oxidative glucose metabolism are pertinent to the study of the human brain in health and disease. The latest positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) scanners provide time-of-flight (TOF) imaging and critical improvements in spatial resolution and reduction of artifacts. This has led to significantly improved imaging with lower radiotracer doses. Optimized methods for the latest PET-CT scanners involve administering a sequence of inhaled15O-labeled carbon monoxide (CO) and oxygen (O2), intravenous15O-labeled water (H2O), and18F-deoxyglucose (FDG)-all within 2-h or 3-h scan sessions that yield high-resolution, quantitative measurements of CMRGlc, CMRO2, CBF, CBV, and AG.

Drug characteristics derived from kinetic modeling: combined 11C-UCB-J human PET imaging with levetiracetam and brivaracetam occupancy of SV2A,"Mika Naganawa, Jean-Dominique Gallezot, Sjoerd J Finnema, Ralph Paul Maguire, Joël Mercier, Nabeel B Nabulsi, Sophie Kervyn, Shannan Henry, Jean-Marie Nicolas, Yiyun Huang, Ming-Kai Chen, Jonas Hannestad, Henrik Klitgaard, Armel Stockis, Richard E Carson","Background: Antiepileptic drugs, levetiracetam (LEV) and brivaracetam (BRV), bind to synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A). In their anti-seizure activity, speed of brain entry may be an important factor. BRV showed faster entry into the human and non-human primate brain, based on more rapid displacement of SV2A tracer11C-UCB-J. To extract additional information from previous human studies, we developed a nonlinear model that accounted for drug entry into the brain and binding to SV2A using brain11C-UCB-J positron emission tomography (PET) data and the time-varying plasma drug concentration, to assess the kinetic parameter K1(brain entry rate) of the drugs.

Method: Displacement (LEV or BRV p.i. 60 min post-tracer injection) and post-dose scans were conducted in five healthy subjects. Blood samples were collected for measurement of drug concentration and the tracer arterial input function. Fitting of nonlinear differential equations was applied simultaneously to time-activity curves (TACs) from displacement and post-dose scans to estimate 5 parameters: K1(drug), K1(11C-UCB-J, displacement), K1(11C-UCB-J, post-dose), free fraction of11C-UCB-J in brain (fND(11C-UCB-J)), and distribution volume of11C-UCB-J (VT(UCB-J)). Other parameters (KD(drug), KD(11C-UCB-J), fP(drug), fP(11C-UCB-J, displacement), fP(11C-UCB-J, post-dose), fND(drug), koff(drug), koff(11C-UCB-J)) were fixed to literature or measured values.

Results: The proposed model described well the TACs in all subjects; however, estimates of drug K1were unstable in comparison with11C-UCB-J K1estimation. To provide a conservative estimate of the relative speed of brain entry for BRV vs. LEV, we determined a lower bound on the ratio BRV K1/LEV K1, by finding the lowest BRV K1or highest LEV K1that were statistically consistent with the data. Specifically, we used the F test to compare the residual sum of squares with fixed BRV K1to that with floating BRV K1to obtain the lowest possible BRV K1; the same analysis was performed to find the highest LEV K1. The lower bound of the ratio BRV K1/LEV K1was ~ 7.

Conclusions: Under appropriate conditions, this advanced nonlinear model can directly estimate entry rates of drugs into tissue by analysis of PET TACs. Using a conservative statistical cutoff, BRV enters the brain at least sevenfold faster than LEV.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36346513/

We recently developed two PET ligands with an aryloxyanilide structure to image PBRs and now evaluate the kinetics of these radiotracers in monkey to determine whether they are suitable to explore in human. Baseline and receptor-blocking scans were performed with [(11)C]PBR01 and [(18)F]PBR06 in conjunction with serial measurements of the arterial plasma concentration of parent radiotracer separated from radiometabolite. We used brain and plasma data with compartmental modeling to calculate regional brain distribution volume, which is equal to the ratio at equilibrium of the concentration of radioligand in brain to that of plasma. The distribution volume of [(11)C]PBR01 was inaccurately estimated in the baseline scans, possibly because of the short half-life of (11)C or the presence of radiometabolite in brain. In contrast, the distribution volume of [(18)F]PBR06 was stably determined within 200 min of scanning, and nondisplaceable uptake was only approximately 10% of total brain uptake. [(18)F]PBR06 is promising for use in human because brain activity could be quantified with standard compartmental models and showed higher ratios ( approximately 10:1) of specific to nonspecific uptake. A critical factor for human use will be whether the tracer has adequately fast wash out from brain relative to the half-life of the radionuclide to obtain stable values of distribution volume.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17455247/
Positron emission tomography and target-controlled infusion for precise modulation of brain drug concentration,"Olof Eriksson, Ray Josephsson, Bengt Långstrom, Mats Bergström","Introduction: There are several instances when it is desirable to control brain concentration of pharmaceuticals, e.g., to modulate the concentration of anesthetic agents to different desired levels fitting to different needs during the course of surgery. This has so far only been possible using indirect estimates of drug concentration such as assuming constant relation between tissue and blood including extrapolations from animals.

Methods: A system for controlling target tissue concentration (UIPump) was used to regulate whole-brain concentrations of a central benzodiazepine receptor antagonist at therapeutic levels with input from brain kinetics as determined with PET. The system was tested by using pharmacological doses of flumazenil mixed with tracer amounts of [11C]flumazenil. Flumazenil was used as a model compound for anesthesia. An infusion scheme to produce three different steady-state levels in sequence was designed based on kinetic curves obtained after bolus injection. The subjects (Sprague-Dawley rats, n=6) were monitored in a microPET scanner during the whole experiment to verify resulting brain kinetic curves.

Results: A steady-state brain concentration was rapidly achieved corresponding to a whole-brain concentration of 118+/-6 ng/ml. As the infusion rate decreased to lower the exposure by a factor of 2, the brain concentration decreased to 56+/-4 ng/ml. A third increased steady-state level of anesthesia corresponding to a whole-brain concentration of 107+/-7 ng/ml was rapidly achieved.

Conclusion: The experimental setup with computerized pump infusion and PET supervision enables accurate setting of target tissue drug concentration.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18355685/

[18F]SynVesT-1 PET scans were performed in C57BL/6J mice in five conditions: isoflurane anesthesia (ANISO), ketamine-xylazine (ANKX), awake freely moving (AW), awake followed by isoflurane administration (AW/ANISO) or followed by ketamine-xylazine (AW/ANKX) 20 min post tracer injection. ANISO, ANKX and AW scans were also performed in mice administered with levetiracetam (LEV, 200 mg/kg) to assess non-displaceable binding. Metabolite analysis was performed in ANISO, ANKX and AW mice. Finally,in vivoautoradiography in ANISO, ANKX and AW mice at 30 min post-injection was performed for validation. Kinetic modeling, with a metabolite corrected image derived input function, was performed to calculate total and non-displaceable volume of distribution (VT(IDIF)).VT(IDIF)was higher in ANISO compared to AW (p < 0.0001) whileVT(IDIF)in ANKX was lower compared with AW (p < 0.0001). Non-displaceableVT(IDIF)was significantly different between ANISO and AW, but not between ANKX and AW. Change in the TAC washout was observed after administration of either isoflurane or ketamine-xylazine. Observed changes in tracer kinetics and volume of distribution might be explained by physiological changes due to anesthesia, as well as by induced cellular effects.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37113068/
Exploring the use of shape and texture descriptors of positron emission tomography tracer distribution in imaging studies of neurodegenerative disease,"Ivan S Klyuzhin, Marjorie Gonzalez, Elham Shahinfard, Nasim Vafai, Vesna Sossi","Positron emission tomography (PET) data related to neurodegeneration are most often quantified using methods based on tracer kinetic modeling. In contrast, here we investigate the ability of geometry and texture-based metrics that are independent of kinetic modeling to convey useful information on disease state. The study was performed using data from Parkinson's disease subjects imaged with (11)C-dihydrotetrabenazine and (11)C-raclopride. The pattern of the radiotracer distribution in the striatum was quantified using image-based metrics evaluated over multiple regions of interest that were defined on co-registered PET and MRI images. Regression analysis showed a significant degree of correlation between several investigated metrics and clinical evaluations of the disease (p < 0.01). The best results were obtained with the first-order moment invariant of the radioactivity concentration values estimated over the full structural extent of the region as defined by MRI (R(2 )= 0.94). These results demonstrate that there is clinically relevant quantitative information in the tracer distribution pattern that can be captured using geometric and texture descriptors. Such metrics may provide an alternate and complementary data analysis approach to traditional kinetic modeling.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26661171/
Astrocytic tracer dynamics estimated from [1-¹¹C]-acetate PET measurements,"Andrea Arnold, Daniela Calvetti, Albert Gjedde, Peter Iversen, Erkki Somersalo","We address the problem of estimating the unknown parameters of a model of tracer kinetics from sequences of positron emission tomography (PET) scan data using a statistical sequential algorithm for the inference of magnitudes of dynamic parameters. The method, based on Bayesian statistical inference, is a modification of a recently proposed particle filtering and sequential Monte Carlo algorithm, where instead of preassigning the accuracy in the propagation of each particle, we fix the time step and account for the numerical errors in the innovation term. We apply the algorithm to PET images of [1-¹¹C]-acetate-derived tracer accumulation, estimating the transport rates in a three-compartment model of astrocytic uptake and metabolism of the tracer for a cohort of 18 volunteers from 3 groups, corresponding to healthy control individuals, cirrhotic liver and hepatic encephalopathy patients. The distribution of the parameters for the individuals and for the groups presented within the Bayesian framework support the hypothesis that the parameters for the hepatic encephalopathy group follow a significantly different distribution than the other two groups. The biological implications of the findings are also discussed.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25424579/
Kinetic analysis of 2-[11C]thymidine PET imaging studies of malignant brain tumors: compartmental model investigation and mathematical analysis,"Joanne M Wells, David A Mankoff, Mark Muzi, Finbarr O'Sullivan, Janet F Eary, Alexander M Spence, Kenneth A Krohn","2-[11C]Thymidine (TdR), a PET tracer for cellular proliferation, may be advantageous for monitoring brain tumor progression and response to therapy. We previously described and validated a five-compartment model for thymidine incorporation into DNA in somatic tissues, but the effect of the blood-brain barrier on the transport of TdR and its metabolites necessitated further validation before it could be applied to brain tumors.

Methods: We investigated the behavior of the model under conditions experienced in the normal brain and brain tumors, performed sensitivity and identifiability analysis to determine the ability of the model to estirmine whether it can distinguish between thymidine transport and retention.

Results: Sensitivity and identifiability analysis suggested that the non-CO2 metabolite parameters could be fixed without significantly affecting thymidine parameter estimation. Simulations showed that K1t and KTdR could be estimated accurately (r = .97 and .98 for estimated vs. true parameters) with standard errors < 15%. The model was able to separate increased transport from increased retention associated with tumor proliferation.

Conclusion: Our model adequately describes normal brain and brain tumor kinetics for thymidine and its metabolites, and it can provide an estimate of the rate of cellular proliferation in brain tumors.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12920853/
Quantitative analysis of (-)-N-(11)C-propyl-norapomorphine in vivo binding in nonhuman primates,"Dah-Ren Hwang, Rajesh Narendran, Yiyun Huang, Mark Slifstein, Peter S Talbot, Yasuhiko Sudo, Bart N Van Berckel, Lawrence S Kegeles, Diana Martinez, Marc Laruelle","(-)-N-(11)C-propyl-norapomorphine ((11)C-NPA) is a new dopamine agonist PET radiotracer that holds potential for imaging the high-affinity states of dopamine D(2)-like receptors in the living brain. The goal of this study was to develop and evaluate analytic strategies to derive in vivo (11)C-NPA binding parameters.

Methods: Two baboons were scanned 4 times after (11)C-NPA injections. The metabolite-corrected arterial input functions were measured. Regional brain time-activity curves were analyzed with kinetic and graphical analyses, using the arterial time-activity curve as the input function. Data were also analyzed with the simplified reference-tissue model (SRTM) and graphical analysis with reference-region input.

Results: (11)C-NPA exhibited moderately fast metabolism, with 31% +/- 5% of arterial plasma concentration corresponding to the parent compound at 40 min after injection. Plasma clearance was 29 +/- 1 L/h, and plasma free fraction (f(1)) was 5% +/- 1%. For kinetic analysis, a 1-tissue compartment model (1TCM) provided a good fit to the data and more robust derivations of the tissue distribution volumes (V(T), in mL/g) than a 2-tissue compartment model (2TCM). Using 1TCM, V(T)s in the cerebellum and striatum were 3.4 +/- 0.4 and 7.5 +/- 2 mL/g, respectively, which led to estimates of striatal binding potential (BP) of 4.0 +/- 1.1 mL/g and striatal equilibrium specific-to-nonspecific partition coefficient (V(3)"") of 1.2 +/- 0.2. V(T) values derived with graphical analysis were well correlated with but slightly lower than V(T) values derived with kinetic analysis. V(3)"" values derived with SRTM were well correlated with but slightly higher than V(3)"" values derived with kinetic analysis. Using any method, a significant difference was detected in BP and V(3)"" values between the 2 animals. It was determined that 30 min of scanning data were sufficient to derive V(3)"" values using kinetic, graphical (arterial input and reference-region input), and SRTM analyses.

Conclusion: This study indicates that (11)C-NPA is a suitable PET tracer to quantify the agonist high-affinity sites of D(2)-like receptors.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14960658/
Imaging of αvβ3 integrin expression in experimental myocardial ischemia with [68Ga]NODAGA-RGD positron emission tomography,"Maria Grönman, Miikka Tarkia, Tuomas Kiviniemi, Paavo Halonen, Antti Kuivanen, Timo Savunen, Tuula Tolvanen, Jarmo Teuho, Meeri Käkelä, Olli Metsälä, Mikko Pietilä, Pekka Saukko, Seppo Ylä-Herttuala, Juhani Knuuti, Anne Roivainen, Antti Saraste","Background: Radiolabeled RGD peptides detect αvβ3integrin expression associated with angiogenesis and extracellular matrix remodeling after myocardial infarction. We studied whether cardiac positron emission tomography (PET) with [68Ga]NODAGA-RGD detects increased αvβ3integrin expression after induction of flow-limiting coronary stenosis in pigs, and whether αvβ3integrin is expressed in viable ischemic or injured myocardium.

Methods: We studied 8 Finnish landrace pigs 13 ± 4 days after percutaneous implantation of a bottleneck stent in the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery. Antithrombotic therapy was used to prevent stent occlusion. Myocardial uptake of [68Ga]NODAGA-RGD (290 ± 31 MBq) was evaluated by a 62 min dynamic PET scan. The ischemic area was defined as the regional perfusion abnormality during adenosine-induced stress by [15O]water PET. Guided by triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining, tissue samples from viable and injured myocardial areas were obtained for autoradiography and histology.

Results: Stent implantation resulted in a partly reversible myocardial perfusion abnormality. Compared with remote myocardium, [68Ga]NODAGA-RGD PET showed increased tracer uptake in the ischemic area (ischemic-to-remote ratio 1.3 ± 0.20, p = 0.0034). Tissue samples from the injured areas, but not from the viable ischemic areas, showed higher [68Ga]NODAGA-RGD uptake than the remote non-ischemic myocardium. Uptake of [68Ga]NODAGA-RGD correlated with immunohistochemical detection of αvβ3integrin that was expressed in the injured myocardial areas.

Conclusions: Cardiac [68Ga]NODAGA-RGD PET demonstrates increased myocardial αvβ3integrin expression after induction of flow-limiting coronary stenosis in pigs. Localization of [68Ga]NODAGA-RGD uptake indicates that it reflects αvβ3integrin expression associated with repair of recent myocardial injury.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28629432/
"[11C]JNJ54173717, a novel P2X7 receptor radioligand as marker for neuroinflammation: human biodistribution, dosimetry, brain kinetic modelling and quantification of brain P2X7 receptors in patients with Parkinson's disease and healthy volunteers","Donatienne Van Weehaeghe, Michel Koole, Mark E Schmidt, Stephanie Deman, Andreas H Jacobs, Erika Souche, Kim Serdons, Stefan Sunaert, Guy Bormans, Wim Vandenberghe, Koen Van Laere","Purpose: The P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) is an ATP-gated ion channel predominantly expressed on activated microglia and is important in neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson's disease (PD). In this first-in-human study, we investigated [11C]JNJ54173717 ([11C]JNJ717), a selective P2X7R tracer, in healthy volunteers (HV) and PD patients. Biodistribution, dosimetry, kinetic modelling and short-term test-retest variation (TRV), as well as possible genotype effects, were investigated.

Methods: Biodistribution and radiation dosimetry studies were performed in three HV (mean age 30 ± 2 years, two women) using whole-body PET/CT. The most appropriate kinetic model was determined in 11 HV (mean age 62 ± 10 years, six women) and 10 PD patients (mean age 64 ± 8 years, three women; mean UPDRS motor score 21 ± 8) using 90-min dynamic simultaneous PET/MR scans. The total volume of distribution (VT) was calculated using a one-tissue and a two-tissue compartment model (1TCM, 2TCM) and Logan graphical analysis, and its time stability was assessed. Seven subjects underwent retest scans (mean age 60 ± 13 years, four HV, one woman). A group analysis was performed to compare PD patients and HV. Finally, 13 exons of P2X7R were genotyped in all subjects included in the second part of the study.

Results: The mean effective dose was 4.47 ± 0.32 μSv/MBq, with the highest absorbed doses to the gallbladder, liver and small intestine. A reversible 2TCM was the most appropriate kinetic model with relatively homogeneous VTvalues in the grey and white matter. Average VTvalues were 3.4 ± 0.8 in HV and 3.3 ± 0.7 in PD patients, with no significant difference between the groups, but a possible genotype effect (rs3751143) was identified which can affect VT. Average TRV was 10-15%. The stability of VTover time allowed a reduction in scan time to 70 min.

Conclusion: [11C]JNJ717 is safe and suitable for quantifying P2X7R expression in human brain. In this pilot study, no significant differences in P2X7R binding were found between HV and PD patients. The results also suggest that genotype effects need to be incorporated in future P2X7R PET analyses.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31243495/
Quantification of receptor-ligand binding with [¹⁸F]fluciclatide in metastatic breast cancer patients,"Giampaolo Tomasi, Laura Kenny, Francesco Mauri, Federico Turkheimer, Eric O Aboagye","Purpose: The purpose of the study was to estimate the receptor-ligand binding of an arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) peptide in somatic tumours. To this aim, we employed dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) data obtained from breast cancer patients with metastases, studied with the α(v)β(3/5) integrin receptor radioligand [(18)F]fluciclatide.

Methods: First, compartmental modelling and spectral analysis with arterial input function were performed at the region of interest (ROI) level in healthy lung and liver, and in lung and liver metastases; compartmental modelling was also carried out at the pixel level. The selection of the most appropriate indexes for tumour/healthy tissue differentiation and for estimation of specific binding was then assessed.

Results: The two-tissue reversible model emerged as the best according to the Akaike Information Criterion. Spectral analysis confirmed the reversibility of tracer kinetics. Values of kinetic parameters, estimated as mean from parametric maps, correlated well with those computed from ROI analysis. The volume of distribution V(T) was on average higher in lung metastases than in the healthy lung, but lower in liver metastases than in the healthy liver. In agreement with the expected higher α(v)β(3/5) expression in pathology, k(3) and k(3)/k(4) were both remarkably higher in metastases, which makes them more suitable than V(T) for tumour/healthy tissue differentiation. The ratio k(3)/k(4), in particular, appeared a reasonable measure of specific binding.

Conclusion: Besides establishing the best quantitative approaches for the analysis of [(18)F]fluciclatide data, this study indicated that the k(3)/k(4) ratio is a reasonable measure of specific binding, suggesting that this index can be used to estimate α(v)β(3/5) receptor expression in oncology, although further studies are necessary to validate this hypothesis.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21892622/
"PET Parametric Imaging: Past, Present, and Future","Guobao Wang, Arman Rahmim, Roger N Gunn","Positron emission tomography (PET) is actively used in a diverse range of applications in oncology, cardiology, and neurology. The use of PET in the clinical setting focuses on static (single time frame) imaging at a specific time-point post radiotracer injection and is typically considered as semi-quantitative; e.g. standardized uptake value (SUV) measures. In contrast, dynamic PET imaging requires increased acquisition times but has the advantage that it measures the full spatiotemporal distribution of a radiotracer and, in combination with tracer kinetic modeling, enables the generation of multiparametric images that more directly quantify underlying biological parameters of interest, such as blood flow, glucose metabolism, and receptor binding. Parametric images have the potential for improved detection and for more accurate and earlier therapeutic response assessment. Parametric imaging with dynamic PET has witnessed extensive research in the past four decades. In this paper, we provide an overview of past and present activities and discuss emerging opportunities in the field of parametric imaging for the future.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33763624/
Impact of tracer uptake rate on quantification accuracy of myocardial blood flow in PET: A simulation study,"Xiaotong Hong, Amirhossein Sanaat, Yazdan Salimi, René Nkoulou, Hossein Arabi, Lijun Lu, Habib Zaidi","Background: Cardiac perfusion PET is commonly used to assess ischemia and cardiovascular risk, which enables quantitative measurements of myocardial blood flow (MBF) through kinetic modeling. However, the estimation of kinetic parameters is challenging due to the noisy nature of short dynamic frames and limited sample data points.

Purpose: This work aimed to investigate the errors in MBF estimation in PET through a simulation study and to evaluate different parameter estimation approaches, including a deep learning (DL) method.

Materials and methods: Simulated studies were generated using digital phantoms based on cardiac segmentations from 55 clinical CT images. We employed the irreversible 2-tissue compartmental model and simulated dynamic13N-ammonia PET scans under both rest and stress conditions (220 cases each). The simulations covered a rest K1range of 0.6 to 1.2 and a stress K1range of 1.2 to 3.6 (unit: mL/min/g) in the myocardium. A transformer-based DL model was trained on the simulated dataset to predict parametric images (PIMs) from noisy PET image frames and was validated using 5-fold cross-validation. We compared the DL method with the voxel-wise nonlinear least squares (NLS) fitting applied to the dynamic images, using either Gaussian filter (GF) smoothing (GF-NLS) or a dynamic nonlocal means (DNLM) algorithm for denoising (DNLM-NLS). Two patients with coronary CT angiography (CTA) and fractional flow reserve (FFR) were enrolled to test the feasibility of applying DL models on clinical PET data.

Results: The DL method showed clearer image structures with reduced noise compared to the traditional NLS-based methods. In terms of mean absolute relative error (MARE), as the rest K1values increased from 0.6 to 1.2 mL/min/g, the overall bias in myocardium K1estimates decreased from approximately 58% to 45% for the NLS-based methods while the DL method showed a reduction in MARE from 42% to 18%. For stress data, as the stress K1decreased from 3.6 to 1.2 mL/min/g, the MARE increased from 30% to 70% for the GF-NLS method. In contrast, both the DNLM-NLS (average: 42%) and the DL methods (average: 20%) demonstrated significantly smaller MARE changes as stress K1varied. Regarding the regional mean bias (±standard deviation), the GF-NLS method had a bias of 6.30% (±8.35%) of rest K1, compared to 1.10% (±8.21%) for DNLM-NLS and 6.28% (±14.05%) for the DL method. For the stress K1, the GF-NLS showed a mean bias of 10.72% (±9.34%) compared to 1.69% (±8.82%) for DNLM-NLS and -10.55% (±9.81%) for the DL method.

Significance: This study showed that an increase in the tracer uptake rate (K1) corresponded to improved accuracy and precision in MBF quantification, whereas lower tracer uptake resulted in higher noise in dynamic PET and poorer parameter estimates. Utilizing denoising techniques or DL approaches can mitigate noise-induced bias in PET parametric imaging.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40344168/

An automated synthesis of [(18)F]1 was developed in which the intermediate 4-[(18)F]fluoro-m-tyramine ([(18)F]16) was prepared using a diaryliodonium salt precursor for nucleophilic aromatic [(18)F]fluorination. In PET imaging studies in rhesus macaque monkeys, [(18)F]1 demonstrated high quality cardiac images with low uptake in lungs and the liver. Compartmental modeling of [(18)F]1 kinetics provided net uptake rate constants Ki (mL/min/g wet), and Patlak graphical analysis of [(18)F]1 kinetics provided Patlak slopes Kp (mL/min/g). In pharmacological blocking studies with the norepinephrine transporter inhibitor desipramine (DMI), each of these quantitative measures declined in a dose-dependent manner with increasing DMI doses. These initial results strongly suggest that [(18)F]1 can provide quantitative measures of regional cardiac sympathetic nerve density in human hearts using PET.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23965035/
In Vivo Quantification of ERβ Expression by Pharmacokinetic Modeling: Studies with 18F-FHNP PET,"Inês F Antunes, Antoon T M Willemsen, Jurgen W A Sijbesma, Ate S Boerema, Aren van Waarde, Andor W J M Glaudemans, Rudi A J O Dierckx, Elisabeth G E de Vries, Geke A P Hospers, Erik F J de Vries","The estrogen receptor (ER) is a target for endocrine therapy in breast cancer patients. Individual quantification of ERα and ERβ expression, rather than total ER levels, might enable better prediction of the response to treatment. We recently developed the tracer 2-18F-fluoro-6-(6-hydroxynaphthalen-2-yl)pyridin-3-ol (18F-FHNP) for assessment of ERβ levels with PET. In the current study, we investigated several pharmacokinetic analysis methods to quantify changes in ERβ availability with18F-FHNP PET.Methods:Male nude rats were subcutaneously inoculated in the shoulder with ERα/ERβ-expressing SKOV3 human ovarian cancer cells. Two weeks after tumor inoculation, a dynamic18F-FHNP PET scan with arterial blood sampling was acquired from rats treated with vehicle or various concentrations of estradiol (nonspecific ER agonist) or genistein (ERβ-selective agonist). Different pharmacokinetic models were applied to quantify ERβ availability in the tumor.Results:Irreversible-uptake compartmental models fitted the kinetics of18F-FHNP uptake better than reversible models. The irreversible 3-tissue-compartment model, which included both the parent and the metabolite input function, gave results comparable to those of the irreversible 2-tissue-compartment model with only a parent input function, indicating that radioactive metabolites contributed little to the tumor uptake. Patlak graphical analysis gave metabolic rates (Ki, the irreversible uptake rate constant) comparable to compartment modeling. TheKivalues correlated well with ERβ expression but not with ERα, confirming thatKiis a suitable parameter to quantify ERβ expression. SUVs at 60 min after tracer injection also correlated (r2= 0.47;P= 0.04) with ERβ expression. A reduction in18F-FHNP tumor uptake andKivalues was observed in the presence of estradiol or genistein.Conclusion:18F-FHNP PET enables assessment of ERβ availability in tumor-bearing rats. The most suitable parameter to quantify ERβ expression is theKiHowever, a simplified static imaging protocol for determining the SUVs can be applied to assess ERβ levels.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28705918/
First-pass measurements of regional blood flow with external detectors,"N A Mullani, K L Gould","A powerful, simple model has been developed for measuring regional blood flow using first-pass tracer kinetics with external detectors such as fast positron emission tomographs (PET). Its derivation is based on the hypothesis that during the first transit of a bolus of activity through an organ there exists a period during which the tracer has not left the region of interest, so that the venous concentration of the tracer is zero. Provided that this condition is met, measurement of blood flow can be obtained in any organ with any radiotracer since there are no requirements in the derivation of the model for diffusion or extraction characteristics of the tracer. The general model has been demonstrated for a special case in the heart using intravenous bolus injections of rubidium-82 with regional positron detectors (beta probes) and validated by comparison with independently determined for by labeled microspheres over a wide range of flow values from zero to five times normal resting coronary blood flow.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6602868/
Compartment model for measuring myocardial oxygen consumption using [1-11C]acetate,"K T Sun, K Chen, S C Huang, D B Buxton, H W Hansen, A S Kim, S Siegel, Y Choi, P Müller, M E Phelps, H R Schelbert","Although [1-11C]acetate has been validated as a PET tracer for myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO2) in animals and humans, mono- and biexponential fitting of the tissue time-activity curve yields only estimates of MVO2. This study attempts to develop and validate a simple tracer kinetic model in vivo for estimation of regional MVO2.

Methods: Twenty-seven experiments were performed in 12 anesthetized dogs with [1-11C]acetate and serial PET images under different MBF and MVO2 (baseline, ischemia, xylazine, dobutamine and dipyridamole). Estimates of MVO2 were obtained from dynamic [1-11C]acetate PET and model fitting. MBF was measured by radiolabeled microspheres, and MVO2 was calculated by the Fick method using arterial and coronary blood samples.

Results: The proposed model fitted equally well for all study conditions with a multiple correlation coefficient of 0.985 +/- 0.026. Estimated MVO2 correlated linearly with measured MVO2 (y = 0.033 + 0.690x, r = 0.92, s.e. of estimates = 0.020).

Conclusion: This study indicates that MVO2 can be assessed with PET and [1-11C]acetate over a wide range with a simple tracer kinetic model.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9074539/
Alpha[C-11]methyl-L-tryptophan PET maps brain serotonin synthesis and kynurenine pathway metabolism,"D C Chugani, O Muzik","Alpha[C-11]methyl-L-tryptophan (AMT) is an analog of tryptophan used with positron emission tomography for the measurement of serotonin synthesis in humans. Several attempts have been made to estimate the serotonin synthesis rate from plasma and brain kinetic data of AMT using the same model as that applied for the measurement of the glucose metabolic rate with 2-deoxyglucose. However, although AMT is similar to 2-deoxyglucose with regard to an irreversible pool of tracer uptake, there are important differences between the two tracers and how the model can be applied. These differences include transport at the blood-brain barrier and the presence of a large unmetabolized pool of AMT, precluding the method from providing the absolute serotonin synthesis rate. Despite this limitation, the unidirectional uptake rate constant (K-complex) values have been found to be stable within an individual, and the rank order of regional brain values for K-complex are consistent with the rank order for serotonin content in human brain. Furthermore, changes in K-complex with age, gender, and disease states are consistent with previously reported biochemical measurements of serotonin in brain tissue. The authors suggest, therefore, that the K-complex is an index of serotonin synthesis which they have termed the ""serotonin synthesis capacity."" The authors argue that AMT is a useful tracer for study of serotonergic mechanisms, and under certain pathologic states, of metabolism by means of the kynurenine pathway.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10616786/
Biodistribution and radiation dosimetry of [18F]-JK-PSMA-7 as a novel prostate-specific membrane antigen-specific ligand for PET/CT imaging of prostate cancer,"Melanie Hohberg, Carsten Kobe, Philipp Krapf, Philipp Täger, Jochen Hammes, Felix Dietlein, Boris D Zlatopolskiy, Heike Endepols, Markus Wild, Stephan Neubauer, Axel Heidenreich, Bernd Neumaier, Alexander Drzezga, Markus Dietlein","Aim: We investigated the whole-body distribution and the radiation dosimetry of [18F]-JK-PSMA-7, a novel18F-labeled PSMA-ligand for PET/CT imaging of prostate cancer.

Methods: Ten patients with prostate cancer and biochemical recurrence or radiologic evidence of metastatic diseases were examined with 329-384 MBq (mean 359 ± 17 MBq) [18F]-JK-PSMA-7. Eight sequential positron emission tomography (PET) scans were acquired from 20 min to 3 h after injection with IRB approval. The kidneys, liver, lungs, spleen, and salivary glands were segmented into volumes of interest using the QDOSE dosimetry software suite (ABX-CRO, Germany). Absorbed and effective dose were calculated using the ICRP-endorsed IDAC 1.0 package. The absorbed dose of the salivary glands was determined using the spherical model of OLINDA 1.1. PSMA-positive lesions were evaluated separately. Quantitative assessment of the uptake in suspicious lesions was performed by analysis of maximum (max) and peak SUV values. The gluteus maximus muscle (SUVmean) served as a reference region for the calculation of tumor-to-background ratios (TBR's).

Results: Physiologic radiotracer accumulation was observed in the salivary and lacrimal glands, liver, spleen, and intestines, in a pattern resembling the distribution known from other PSMA-tracers with excretion via urinary and biliary pathways. The effective dose from [18F]-JK-PSMA-7 for the whole body was calculated to be 1.09E-02 mGy/MBq. The highest radiation dose was observed in the kidneys (1.76E-01 mGy/MBq), followed by liver (7.61E-02 mGy/MBq), salivary glands (4.68E-02 mGy/MBq), spleen (1.89E-02 mGy/MBq), and lungs (1.10E-2 mGy/MBq). No adverse effects of tracer injection were observed. Six out of ten patients were scored as PSMA-positive. A total of 18 suspicious lesions were analyzed, which included six bone lesions, nine lymph nodes, and three local lesions within the prostate fossa. The values for the SUVmaxand SUVpeakin the PSMA-positive lesions increased until 60 min p.i. and remained at this intensity in the PET/CT scans until 140 min. In the period between 170 and 200 min after injection, a further significant increase in SUVmaxand SUVpeakwithin the PSMA-positive lesions was observed.

Conclusions: The highest TBR of [18F]-JK-PSMA-7 was found 3 h after injection. From the kinetically collected data, it can be concluded that this trend may also continue in the further course. The start of the PET/CT acquisition should be chosen as late as possible. The high uptake in suspicious lesions in terms of absolute SUVmaxand relative TBR values indicates potentially high sensitivity of the tracer for detection of prostate cancer manifestations.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31346821/
Simplified Methods for Quantification of 18F-DCFPyL Uptake in Patients with Prostate Cancer,"Bernard H E Jansen, Maqsood Yaqub, Jens Voortman, Matthijs C F Cysouw, Albert D Windhorst, Robert C Schuit, Gerbrand M Kramer, Alfons J M van den Eertwegh, Lothar A Schwarte, N Harry Hendrikse, André N Vis, Reindert J A van Moorselaar, Otto S Hoekstra, Ronald Boellaard, Daniela E Oprea-Lager","Radiolabeled prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET has demonstrated promising results for prostate cancer (PCa) imaging. Quantification of PSMA radiotracer uptake is desired as it enables reliable interpretation of PET images, use of PSMA uptake as an imaging biomarker for tumor characterization, and evaluation of treatment effects. The aim of this study was to perform a full pharmacokinetic analysis of 2-(3-(1-carboxy-5-[(6-18F-fluoro-pyridine-3-carbonyl)-amino]-pentyl)-ureido)-pentanedioic acid (18F-DCFPyL), a second-generation18F-labeled PSMA ligand. On the basis of the pharmacokinetic analysis (reference method), simplified methods for quantification of18F-DCFPyL uptake were validated.Methods:Eight patients with metastasized PCa were included. Dynamic PET acquisitions were performed at 0-60 and 90-120 min after injection of a median dose of 313 MBq of18F-DCFPyL (range, 292-314 MBq). Continuous and manual arterial blood sampling provided calibrated plasma tracer input functions. Time-activity curves were derived for each PCa metastasis, and18F-DCFPyL kinetics were described using standard plasma input tissue-compartment models. Simplified methods for quantification of18F-DCFPyL uptake (SUVs; tumor-to-blood ratios [TBRs]) were correlated with kinetic parameter estimates obtained from full pharmacokinetic analysis.Results:In total, 46 metastases were evaluated. A reversible 2-tissue-compartment model was preferred for18F-DCFPyL kinetics in 59% of the metastases. The observedk4was small, however, resulting in nearly irreversible kinetics during the course of the PET study. Hence,k4was fixated (0.015) and net influx rate, Ki, was preferred as the reference kinetic parameter. Whole-blood TBR provided an excellent correlation with Kifrom full kinetic analysis (R2= 0.97). This TBR could be simplified further by replacing the blood samples with an image-based, single measurement of blood activity in the ascending aorta (image-based TBR,R2= 0.96). SUV correlated poorly with Ki(R2= 0.47 andR2= 0.60 for SUV normalized to body weight and lean body mass, respectively), most likely because of deviant blood activity concentrations (i.e., tumor tracer input) in patients with higher tumor volumes.Conclusion:18F-DCFPyL kinetics in PCa metastases are best described by a reversible 2-tissue-compartment model. Image-based TBRs were validated as a simplified method to quantify18F-DCFPyL uptake and might be applied to clinical, whole-body PET scans.

We also tested the sensitivity of the estimates to dynamic frame sequence duration, and produced a standard method for minimizing the variations in physiological estimates for FDOPA kinetics in minipig brain. We used minipigs because our previous work has shown them to provide an appropriate animal model for study normal and pathological cerebral DOPA metabolism using PET. Time-activity curves in striatum of adult minipigs were acquired in VOIs defined manually on MR-images, or alternatively on the basis of the radioactivity concentration based on the most radioactive voxel in the last scan frame. For all frame sequences, the relative decarboxylase activity (k(3)(D)) declined significantly (P < 0.006) as the VOI threshold declined from 95 to 70% of the most radioactive voxel. Irrespective of VOI size, the magnitude of k(3)(D) declined significantly (P < 0.001) from 0.074+/-0.008 to 0.045+/-0.005 per min (mean+/-S.E.M.) as total sequence length increased from 60 to 120 min circulation. The method of VOI selection had no significant effect on the striatum decarboxylation index of FDOPA calculated relative to the radioactivity in cerebellum (k(3)(S)).",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11595282/
Cumulated Activity Comparison of 64Cu-/177Lu-Labeled Anti-Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Antibody in Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma Model,"Eric Laffon, Matthieu Thumerel, Jacques Jougon, Roger Marthan","This work aimed at estimating the kinetic parameters, and hence cumulated activity (AC), of a diagnostic/therapeutic convergence radiopharmaceutical, namely64Cu-/177Lu-labeled antibody (64Cu-/177Lu-cetuximab), that acts as anti-epidermal growth factor receptor.Methods:In mice bearing esophageal squamous cell carcinoma tumors, to estimate uptake (K), release rate constant (kR), and hence AC, a kinetic model analysis was applied to recently published biodistribution data of immuno-PET imaging with64Cu-cetuximab and of small-animal SPECT/CT imaging with177Lu-cetuximab, including blood and TE-8 tumor.Results:K, kR, and ACwere estimated to be 0.0566/0.0593 g⋅h-1⋅g-1, 0.0150/0.0030 h-1, and 2.3 × 1010/4.1 × 1012disintegrations (per gram of TE-8 tumor), with an injected activity of 3.70/12.95 MBq, for64Cu-/177Lu-cetuximab, respectively.Conclusion:A model is available for comparing kinetic parameters and ACof the companion diagnostic/therapeutic64Cu-/177Lu-cetuximab that may be considered as a step for determining whether one can really use the former to predict dosimetry of the latter.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28082435/
Deep Learning-Powered CT-Less Multitracer Organ Segmentation From PET Images: A Solution for Unreliable CT Segmentation in PET/CT Imaging,"Yazdan Salimi, Zahra Mansouri, Isaac Shiri, Ismini Mainta, Habib Zaidi","Purpose: The common approach for organ segmentation in hybrid imaging relies on coregistered CT (CTAC) images. This method, however, presents several limitations in real clinical workflows where mismatch between PET and CT images are very common. Moreover, low-dose CTAC images have poor quality, thus challenging the segmentation task. Recent advances in CT-less PET imaging further highlight the necessity for an effective PET organ segmentation pipeline that does not rely on CT images. Therefore, the goal of this study was to develop a CT-less multitracer PET segmentation framework.

Patients and methods: We collected 2062 PET/CT images from multiple scanners. The patients were injected with either 18 F-FDG (1487) or 68 Ga-PSMA (575). PET/CT images with any kind of mismatch between PET and CT images were detected through visual assessment and excluded from our study. Multiple organs were delineated on CT components using previously trained in-house developed nnU-Net models. The segmentation masks were resampled to coregistered PET images and used to train 4 different deep learning models using different images as input, including noncorrected PET (PET-NC) and attenuation and scatter-corrected PET (PET-ASC) for 18 F-FDG (tasks 1 and 2, respectively using 22 organs) and PET-NC and PET-ASC for 68 Ga tracers (tasks 3 and 4, respectively, using 15 organs). The models' performance was evaluated in terms of Dice coefficient, Jaccard index, and segment volume difference.

Results: The average Dice coefficient over all organs was 0.81 ± 0.15, 0.82 ± 0.14, 0.77 ± 0.17, and 0.79 ± 0.16 for tasks 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. PET-ASC models outperformed PET-NC models ( P < 0.05) for most of organs. The highest Dice values were achieved for the brain (0.93 to 0.96 in all 4 tasks), whereas the lowest values were achieved for small organs, such as the adrenal glands. The trained models showed robust performance on dynamic noisy images as well.

Conclusions: Deep learning models allow high-performance multiorgan segmentation for 2 popular PET tracers without the use of CT information. These models may tackle the limitations of using CT segmentation in PET/CT image quantification, kinetic modeling, radiomics analysis, dosimetry, or any other tasks that require organ segmentation masks.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39883026/
Evaluation of the effect of glucose ingestion and kinetic model configurations of FDG in the normal liver,"Y Choi, R A Hawkins, S C Huang, R C Brunken, C K Hoh, C Messa, E U Nitzsche, M E Phelps, H R Schelbert","The liver plays an important role in glucose homeostasis. PET studies with 2-[F-18]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) of the liver (e.g., in neoplasms) require an understanding of the effects of dietary conditions on hepatic FDG uptake.

Methods: Twenty studies were performed on 10 normal volunteers (ages 24 +/- 4) after fasting 4 to 19 hr and again after oral consumption of 100 g of dextrose to investigate tracer kinetic model configurations of FDG in the normal liver and to evaluate the impact of oral glucose on liver in normal subjects. Dynamic PET images were acquired for about 1 hr using a Siemens/CTI 931 tomograph.

Results: A three-compartment model with an input function delay time parameter was the statistically preferred model configuration. The model estimated transport rate constant from plasma to liver, K1, increased significantly (p < 0.05) from 0.864 +/- 0.136 ml/min/g in fasting studies to 1.058 +/- 0.269 ml/min/g in postglucose studies. Glucose loading also significantly increased (p < 0.01) the rate constant for FDG phosphorylation, k3, from 0.005 +/- 0.003 min-1 in fasting studies to 0.013 +/- 0.007 min-1 in postglucose administration and, consequently, significantly increased both the phosphorylation fraction (k3/(k2 + k3)) and the influx constant (K1k3/(k2 + k3)). No significant differences in the liver-to-plasma transport rate constant, k2, dephosphorylation constant, k4, or distribution volume of FDG (K1/(k2 + k3)) were observed.

Conclusion: Dynamic FDG-PET studies can be used to evaluate kinetics of liver glucose metabolism. The results indicate that dietary conditions have a significant effect on hepatic FDG kinetics. Because of the higher net FDG uptake by normal liver after glucose loading, fasting conditions are preferred for FDG liver tumor studies to increase the tumor-to-background contrast.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8176464/
Quantification of 5-HT(1A) receptors in human brain using p-MPPF kinetic modelling and PET,"Sandra M Sanabria-Bohórquez, Francoise Biver, Philippe Damhaut, David Wikler, Claude Veraart, Serge Goldman","Serotonin-1A (5-HT(1A)) receptors are implicated in neurochemical mechanisms underlying anxiety and depression and their treatment. Animal studies have suggested that 4-(2'-methoxyphenyl)-1-[2'-[ N-(2""-pyridinyl)- p-[(18)F]fluorobenzamido] ethyl] piperazine ( p-MPPF) may be a suitable positron emission tomography (PET) tracer of 5-HT(1A) receptors. To test p-MPPF in humans, we performed 60-min dynamic PET scans in 13 healthy volunteers after single bolus injection. Metabolite quantification revealed a fast decrease in tracer plasma concentration, such that at 5 min post injection about 25% of the total radioactivity in plasma corresponded to p-MPPF. Radioactivity concentration was highest in hippocampus, intermediate in neocortex and lowest in basal ganglia and cerebellum. The interactions between p-MPPF and 5-HT(1A) receptors were described using linear compartmental models with plasma input and reference tissue approaches. The two quantification methods provided similar results which are in agreement with previous reports on 5-HT(1A) receptor brain distribution. In conclusion, our results show that p-MPPF is a suitable PET radioligand for 5-HT(1A) receptor human studies.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11807610/
Dual time point method for the quantification of irreversible tracer kinetics: A reference tissue approach applied to [18F]-FDOPA brain PET,"I Lopes Alves, Sanne K Meles, Antoon Tm Willemsen, Rudi A Dierckx, Ana M Marques da Silva, Klaus L Leenders, Michel Koole","The Patlak graphical analysis (PGAREF) for quantification of irreversible tracer binding with a reference tissue model was approximated by a dual time point imaging approach (DTPREF). The DTPREFwas applied to 18 [18F]-FDOPA brain scans using the occipital cortex as reference region (DTPOCC) and compared to both PGAOCCand striatal-to-occipital ratios (SOR). Pearson correlation analysis and Bland-Altman plots showed an excellent correlation and good agreement between DTPOCCand PGAOCC, while correlations between SOR and PGAOCCwere consistently lower. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) demonstrated a similar performance for all methods in differentiating patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) from healthy controls (HC). Specifically for [18F]-FDOPA brain imaging, these findings validate DTPOCCas an approximation for PGAOCC, providing the same quantitative information while reducing the acquisition time to two short static scans. For PD patients, this approach can greatly improve patient comfort while reducing motion artifacts and increasing image quality. In general, DTPREFcan improve the clinical applicability of tracers with irreversible binding characteristics when a reference tissue is available.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28156211/

Optimizing dual-time and serial positron emission tomography and single photon emission computed tomography scans for diagnoses and therapy monitoring,Joseph A Thie,"Introduction: A region's early and late tracer uptake activities, QE and QL, within a dual-time scan (i.e. using two frames) or in serial scans (as for monitoring therapeutic response), are popular quantitative diagnostic aids, especially in oncology. In this paper, maximum performance is sought from their joint use.

Methods: QL/QnE is introduced as a tumor marker with an empirical n. This generalizes traditional data weighting having n=1 for QL/QE, the retention index (RI), with its associated % difference. Using patient data, iterative guessing finds an optimal n that maximizes a measure of diagnostic performance: D=(difference of normal and abnormal marker means)/(their combined SD), which may be computed from values of QL/QnE, as well as of QL, QE, and RI each used alone. For 2-deoxy-2-[F-18]fluoro-D-glucose(FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET) dual-time protocols, another approach to optimization-selection of scan times-is investigated by simulations using the Sokolov model.

Results: A meta-analysis of 12 PET and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) studies with various tracers, cancers, and scan classes (dual-time or serial) finds ns from 0.5 to 1.1. The optimal D necessarily exceeds the best (or any) computed using QE, QL, or RI: negligibly to by as much as 0.6 (or 1.5). The increases in optimal receiver operating curve area (Az) over the best (or any) traditional marker range from negligible to 0.07 (or 0.4). QE alone usually has the lowest D and Az. Statistically significant performance improvement of QL/QnE over QE and QL is shown for most studies. Contrasting with an optimal n, another value n0 can also be found where D=0. Occasionally, n0 can be close to 1, and RI then will have a small D and poor performance. Simulation with kinetic modeling of FDG dual-time scans for liver and liver metastases demonstrates worst and best scan times. Indicated for these imaging protocols are QE at very early cellular transport associated times and QL rather late when phosphorylation/dephosphorylation dominate. Benefits from choosing optimal times in dual-time protocols, especially in combination with choosing optimal ns, can be significant.

Conclusion: A protocol-dependent optimizing parameter n in an improved classification marker can easily be identified in a learning set of scans having normals and abnormals. Finding this parameter below 1.0 in most all studies suggests that a popularly used QL/QE may often overweight early activities. Additionally, QL/QE may sometimes be a poor marker choice and underestimate a protocol's diagnostic capability. Subsequent use of the proposed QL/QnE in settings similar to that of the learning set gives improved diagnostic performance over traditional approaches, although by widely varying amounts. Additionally, a method of seeking optimal scan times is demonstrated and suggests significant gains in dual-time protocol performances are possible.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17899297/
Estimation of the 18F-FDG input function in mice by use of dynamic small-animal PET and minimal blood sample data,"Gregory Z Ferl, Xiaoli Zhang, Hsiao-Ming Wu, Michael C Kreissl, Sung-Cheng Huang","Derivation of the plasma time-activity curve in murine small-animal PET studies is a challenging task when tracers that are sequestered by the myocardium are used, because plasma time-activity curve estimation usually involves drawing a region of interest within the area of the reconstructed image that corresponds to the left ventricle (LV) of the heart. The small size of the LV relative to the resolution of the small-animal PET system, coupled with spillover effects from adjacent myocardial pixels, makes this method reliable only for the earliest frames of the scan. We sought to develop a method for plasma time-activity curve estimation based on a model of tracer kinetics in blood, muscle, and liver.

Methods: Sixteen C57BL/6 mice were injected with (18)F-FDG, and approximately 15 serial blood samples were taken from the femoral artery via a surgically inserted catheter during 60-min small-animal PET scans. Image data were reconstructed by use of filtered backprojection with CT-based attenuation correction. We constructed a 5-compartment model designed to predict the plasma time-activity curve of (18)F-FDG by use of data from a minimum of 2 blood samples and the dynamic small-animal PET scan. The plasma time-activity curve (TACp) was assumed to have 4 exponential components (TAC(P)=A(1)e(lambda(1)t)+A(2)e(lambda(2)t)+A(3)e(lambda(3)t)-(A(1)+A(2)+A(3))e(lambda(4)t)) based on the serial blood samples. Using Bayesian constraints, we fitted 2-compartment submodels of muscle and liver to small-animal PET data for these organs and simultaneously fitted the input (forcing) function to early small-animal PET LV data and 2 blood samples (approximately 10 min and approximately 1 h).

Results: The area under the estimated plasma time-activity curve had an overall Spearman correlation of 0.99 when compared with the area under the gold standard plasma time-activity curve calculated from multiple blood samples. Calculated organ uptake rates (Patlak K(i)) based on the predicted plasma time-activity curve had a correlation of approximately 0.99 for liver, muscle, myocardium, and brain when compared with those based on the gold standard plasma time-activity curve. The model was also able to accurately predict the plasma time-activity curve under experimental conditions that resulted in different rates of clearance of the tracer from blood.

Conclusion: We have developed a robust method for accurately estimating the plasma time-activity curve of (18)F-FDG by use of dynamic small-animal PET data and 2 blood samples.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18006615/
Differentiation of radioligand delivery and binding in the brain: validation of a two-compartment model for [11C]flumazenil,"V A Holthoff, R A Koeppe, K A Frey, A H Paradise, D E Kuhl","We recently developed a two-compartment, two-parameter tracer kinetic model to estimate the in vivo ligand transport rate (K1) and distribution volume (DV) for the benzodiazepine antagonist [11C]flumazenil (FMZ) as measured by positron emission tomography (PET). The aim of the present study was to validate that this simplified model provides a stable measure of regional benzodiazepine receptor availability even when ligand delivery is altered. Six young normal volunteers underwent two PET studies subsequent to intravenous injections of [11C]FMZ. Each FMZ study was immediately preceded by measurements of CBF following injection of [15O]water. One set of scans (water/FMZ) was acquired under resting conditions and the other set during audiovisual stimulation. Six additional volunteers underwent two FMZ studies under identical resting conditions. Parametric images were analyzed and a comparison of test-retest studies in the stimulation group revealed a significant increase of CBF and K1 of FMZ in the occipital cortex evoked by visual activation, whereas no regional changes were noted for the DV of FMZ. No significant changes were noted for either K1 or DV of FMZ when comparing studies in the rest-rest setting. The results indicate that the use of a simple two-compartment model for the tracer kinetic analysis of [11C]FMZ makes it possible to separate high-affinity binding from altered radio-ligand delivery to the human brain.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1874806/
Evaluation of treatment response of cilengitide in an experimental model of breast cancer bone metastasis using dynamic PET with 18F-FDG,"Caixa Cheng, Dorde Komljenovic, Leyun Pan, Antonia Dimitrakopoulou-Strauss, Ludwig Strauss, Tobias Bäuerle","The purpose of this study was the assessment of the feasibility of dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) studies with fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) to quantify effects of the cyclic Arg-Gly-Asp peptide cilengitide, which targets the ανβ 3 and ανβ 5 integrin receptors in rats with breast cancer bone metastases. Rats were inoculated with MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, followed by the development of lytic lesions in the hind leg. Rats with lytic lesions were treated with cilengitide five times weekly on a continuous basis from days 30 to 55 after tumor cell inoculation. Dynamic PET studies with (18)F-FDG were performed in untreated (n=9), controlled (n=4) and treated rats (n=6). The data were assessed using learning-machine two-tissue compartmental analysis. The (18)F-FDG kinetic parameters obtained by two-tissue compartmental model learning-machine showed significant differences when individual parameters were compared between the control group and treated animals. Quantitative assessment of the tracer kinetics and the application of classification analysis to the data provided us with evidence to identify those tumors that demonstrated effect of cilengitide treatment. The transport rate K1 and the phosphorylation rate k3 were significantly different (P=0.033 and 0.038, respectively). Classification analysis based on support vector machines ranking feature elimination of the combination of PET parameters revealed an overall accuracy of 80.0% between treated animals and the control group. We were able to identify 83.3% treated animals compared with the control group based on k2 and VB. In conclusion, the results revealed that cilengitide treatment of experimental breast cancer bone metastases had a significant therapeutic impact on (18)F-FDG kinetics.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21512659/
L-6-[18F]fluoro-dopa metabolism in monkeys and humans: biochemical parameters for the formulation of tracer kinetic models with positron emission tomography,"W P Melega, S T Grafton, S C Huang, N Satyamurthy, M E Phelps, J R Barrio","Characterization of peripheral and cerebral L-3,4-dihydroxy-6-[18F]fluorophenylalanine (FDOPA) metabolism in humans and monkeys has shown FDOPA to be an analogue of L-DOPA for the study of the dopaminergic system with positron emission tomography (PET). In human studies with carbidopa pretreatment, L-3,4-dihydroxy-6-[18F]fluoro-3-O-methylphenylalanine (3-OMFD) was the only FDOPA metabolite detected in plasma. FDOPA administration in monkeys resulted in selective accumulation of FDOPA metabolites in central dopaminergic regions, whereas 3-OMFD of peripheral origin was uniformly distributed among putamen, caudate, frontal cortex, and cerebellum. At 60 min, 3-OMFD and 6-[18F]fluorodopamine (FDA) each represented approximately 35% of the total activity, the remainder being FDOPA and FDA metabolites. These data on monkey and human FDOPA metabolism provide the basis for the configuration of an FDOPA tracer kinetic model with PET.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1939384/
"Whole tumor kinetics analysis of 18F-fluoromisonidazole dynamic PET scans of non-small cell lung cancer patients, and correlations with perfusion CT blood flow","Daniel R McGowan, Michael Skwarski, Bartlomiej W Papiez, Ruth E Macpherson, Fergus V Gleeson, Julia A Schnabel, Geoff S Higgins, John D Fenwick","Background: To determine the relative abilities of compartment models to describe time-courses of 18F-fluoromisonidazole (FMISO) tumor uptake in patients with advanced stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) imaged using dynamic positron emission tomography (dPET), and study correlations between values of the blood flow-related parameter K1obtained from fits of the models and an independent blood flow measure obtained from perfusion CT (pCT). NSCLC patients had a 45-min dynamic FMISO PET/CT scan followed by two static PET/CT acquisitions at 2 and 4-h post-injection. Perfusion CT scanning was then performed consisting of a 45-s cine CT. Reversible and irreversible two-, three- and four-tissue compartment models were fitted to 30 time-activity-curves (TACs) obtained for 15 whole tumor structures in 9 patients, each imaged twice. Descriptions of the TACs provided by the models were compared using the Akaike and Bayesian information criteria (AIC and BIC) and leave-one-out cross-validation. The precision with which fitted model parameters estimated ground-truth uptake kinetics was determined using statistical simulation techniques. Blood flow from pCT was correlated with K1from PET kinetic models in addition to FMISO uptake levels.

Results: An irreversible three-tissue compartment model provided the best description of whole tumor FMISO uptake time-courses according to AIC, BIC, and cross-validation scores totaled across the TACs. The simulation study indicated that this model also provided more precise estimates of FMISO uptake kinetics than other two- and three-tissue models. The K1values obtained from fits of the irreversible three-tissue model correlated strongly with independent blood flow measurements obtained from pCT (Pearson r coefficient = 0.81). The correlation from the irreversible three-tissue model (r = 0.81) was stronger than that from than K1values obtained from fits of a two-tissue compartment model (r = 0.68), or FMISO uptake levels in static images taken at time-points from tracer injection through to 4 h later (maximum at 2 min, r = 0.70).

Conclusions: Time-courses of whole tumor FMISO uptake by advanced stage NSCLC are described best by an irreversible three-tissue compartment model. The K1values obtained from fits of the irreversible three-tissue model correlated strongly with independent blood flow measurements obtained from perfusion CT (r = 0.81).",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30069753/
High Temporal-Resolution Dynamic PET Image Reconstruction Using a New Spatiotemporal Kernel Method,Guobao Wang,"Current clinical dynamic PET has an effective temporal resolution of 5-10 seconds, which can be adequate for traditional compartmental modeling but is inadequate for exploiting the benefit of more advanced tracer kinetic modeling for characterization of diseases (e.g., cancer and heart disease). There is a need to improve dynamic PET to allow fine temporal sampling of 1-2 seconds. However, the reconstruction of these short-time frames from tomographic data is extremely challenging as the count level of each frame is very low and high noise presents in both spatial and temporal domains. Previously, the kernel framework has been developed and demonstrated as a statistically efficient approach to utilizing image prior for low-count PET image reconstruction. Nevertheless, the existing kernel methods mainly explore spatial correlations in the data and only have a limited ability in suppressing temporal noise. In this paper, we propose a new kernel method which extends the previous spatial kernel method to the general spatiotemporal domain. The new kernelized model encodes both spatial and temporal correlations obtained from image prior information and are incorporated into the PET forward projection model to improve themaximumlikelihood(ML) image reconstruction. Computer simulations and an application to real patient scan have shown that the proposed approach can achieve effective noise reduction in both spatial and temporal domains and outperform the spatial kernel method and conventional ML reconstruction method for improving the high temporal-resolution dynamic PET imaging.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30222553/
Quantitative imaging of protein targets in the human brain with PET,"Roger N Gunn, Mark Slifstein, Graham E Searle, Julie C Price","PET imaging of proteins in the human brain with high affinity radiolabelled molecules has a history stretching back over 30 years. During this period the portfolio of protein targets that can be imaged has increased significantly through successes in radioligand discovery and development. This portfolio now spans six major categories of proteins; G-protein coupled receptors, membrane transporters, ligand gated ion channels, enzymes, misfolded proteins and tryptophan-rich sensory proteins. In parallel to these achievements in radiochemical sciences there have also been significant advances in the quantitative analysis and interpretation of the imaging data including the development of methods for image registration, image segmentation, tracer compartmental modeling, reference tissue kinetic analysis and partial volume correction. In this review, we analyze the activity of the field around each of the protein targets in order to give a perspective on the historical focus and the possible future trajectory of the field. The important neurobiology and pharmacology is introduced for each of the six protein classes and we present established radioligands for each that have successfully transitioned to quantitative imaging in humans. We present a standard quantitative analysis workflow for these radioligands which takes the dynamic PET data, associated blood and anatomical MRI data as the inputs to a series of image processing and bio-mathematical modeling steps before outputting the outcome measure of interest on either a regional or parametric image basis. The quantitative outcome measures are then used in a range of different imaging studies including tracer discovery and development studies, cross sectional studies, classification studies, intervention studies and longitudinal studies. Finally we consider some of the confounds, challenges and subtleties that arise in practice when trying to quantify and interpret PET neuroimaging data including motion artifacts, partial volume effects, age effects, image registration and normalization, input functions and metabolites, parametric imaging, receptor internalization and genetic factors.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26513176/

Assessment of acute bone loading in humans using [18F]NaF PET/MRI,"Bryan Haddock, Audrey P Fan, Scott D Uhlrich, Niklas R Jørgensen, Charlotte Suetta, Garry Evan Gold, Feliks Kogan","Purpose: The acute effect of loading on bone tissue and physiology can offer important information with regard to joint function in diseases such as osteoarthritis. Imaging studies using [18F]-sodium fluoride ([18F]NaF) have found changes in tracer kinetics in animals after subjecting bones to strain, indicating an acute physiological response. The aim of this study is to measure acute changes in NaF uptake in human bone due to exercise-induced loading.

Methods: Twelve healthy subjects underwent two consecutive 50-min [18F]NaF PET/MRI examinations of the knees, one baseline followed by one post-exercise scan. Quantification of tracer kinetics was performed using an image-derived input function from the popliteal artery. For both scans, kinetic parameters of KiNLR, K1, k2, k3, and blood volume were mapped parametrically using nonlinear regression with the Hawkins model. The kinetic parameters along with mean SUV and SUVmaxwere compared between the pre- and post-exercise examinations. Differences in response to exercise were analysed between bone tissue types (subchondral, cortical, and trabecular bone) and between regional subsections of knee subchondral bone.

Results: Exercise induced a significant (p < <0.001) increase in [18F]NaF uptake in all bone tissues in both knees, with mean SUV increases ranging from 47% in trabecular bone tissue to 131% in subchondral bone tissue. Kinetic parameters involving vascularization (K1and blood volume) increased, whereas the NaF extraction fraction [k3/(k2+ k3)] was reduced.

Conclusions: Bone loading induces an acute response in bone physiology as quantified by [18F]NaF PET kinetics. Dynamic imaging after bone loading using [18F]NaF PET is a promising diagnostic tool in bone physiology and imaging of biomechanics.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31385012/
DOTATOC PET/CT imaging of a typical carcinoid tumor in a human ex-vivo perfused lung lobe,"Alexis Slama, Benedikt M Schaarschmidt, Özlem Okumus, Ken Herrmann, Clemens Aigner, Stephane Collaud, Hubertus Hautzel","The use of Isolated lung perfusion (ILP), combined with medical imaging modalities such as positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET/CT), provides real-time visualization of tumors in ventilated and perfused vital lung tissue. This experiment intends to show the feasibility and benefits of using ILP combined with PET/CT imaging. Following lung surgery on a 49-year-old male, his left lower lobectomy specimen, which held a typical carcinoid tumor, was preserved on normothermic ILP. Gallium-68-Edotreotide ([68Ga]-DOTATOC) was administered into the ILP circuit, and dynamic emission data from PET/CT was acquired. ILP was carried out for 120 minutes. Near physiologic gas exchange and glucose metabolism were preserved throughout the experiment. The time activity curves (TAC) of 5 different volumes of interest (VOI) showed notable differences in tracer uptake over time. The peripheral area of the carcinoid exhibited delayed but high somatostatin receptor agonist uptake compared to the surrounding parenchyma and the intrapulmonary artery. However, the central area of the carcinoid showed very low [68Ga]-DOTATOC uptake. This experiment demonstrates the potential of ILP combined with PET/CT for kinetic modeling in experimental nuclear medicine imaging. By providing visualization of tracer uptake in perfused lung tissue, this model could potentially improve our understanding of tumor physiology and molecular imaging.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37456303/
[¹¹C]-(R)PK11195 tracer kinetics in the brain of glioma patients and a comparison of two referencing approaches,"Zhangjie Su, Karl Herholz, Alexander Gerhard, Federico Roncaroli, Daniel Du Plessis, Alan Jackson, Federico Turkheimer, Rainer Hinz","Purpose: Translocator protein (TSPO) is a biomarker of neuroinflammation that can be imaged by PET using [¹¹C]-(R)PK11195. We sought to characterize the [¹¹C]-(R)PK11195 kinetics in gliomas of different histotypes and grades, and to compare two reference tissue input functions (supervised cluster analysis versus cerebellar grey matter) for the estimation of [¹¹C]-(R)PK11195 binding in gliomas and surrounding brain structures.

Methods: Twenty-three glioma patients and ten age-matched controls underwent structural MRI and dynamic [¹¹C]-(R)PK11195 PET scans. Tissue time-activity curves (TACs) were extracted from tumour regions as well as grey matter (GM) and white matter (WM) of the brains. Parametric maps of binding potential (BPND) were generated with the simplified reference tissue model using the two input functions, and were compared with each other. TSPO expression was assessed in tumour tissue sections by immunohistochemistry.

Results: Three types of regional kinetics were observed in individual tumour TACs: GM-like kinetics (n=6, clearance of the tracer similar to that in cerebellar GM), WM-like kinetics (n=8, clearance of the tracer similar to that in cerebral WM) and a form of mixed kinetics (n=9, intermediate rate of clearance). Such kinetic patterns differed between low-grade astrocytomas (WM-like kinetics) and oligodendrogliomas (GM-like and mixed kinetics), but were independent of tumour grade. There was good agreement between parametric maps of BPND derived from the two input functions in all controls and 10 of 23 glioma patients. In 13 of the 23 patients, BPND values derived from the supervised cluster input were systematically smaller than those using the cerebellar input. Immunohistochemistry confirmed that TSPO expression increased with tumour grade.

Conclusion: The three types of [¹¹C]-(R)PK11195 kinetics in gliomas are determined in part by tracer delivery, and indicated that kinetic analysis is a valuable tool in the study of gliomas with the potential for in vivo discrimination between low-grade astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas. Supervised cluster and cerebellar input functions produced consistent BPND estimates in approximately half of the gliomas investigated, but had a systematic difference in the remainder. The cerebellar input is preferred based on theoretical and practical considerations.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23715902/
Total-Body Parametric Imaging Using Relative Patlak Plot,"Siqi Li, Yasser G Abdelhafez, Lorenzo Nardo, Simon R Cherry, Ramsey D Badawi, Guobao Wang","The standard Patlak plot, a simple yet efficient model, is widely used to describe irreversible tracer kinetics for dynamic PET imaging. Its widespread application to whole-body parametric imaging remains constrained because of the need for a full-time-course input function (e.g., 1 h). In this paper, we demonstrate the relative Patlak (RP) plot, which eliminates the need for the early-time input function, for total-body parametric imaging and its application to 20-min clinical scans acquired in list mode.Methods:We conducted a theoretic analysis to indicate that the RP interceptb' is equivalent to a ratio of the SUV relative to the plasma concentration, whereas the RP slope' is equal to the standard Patlak(net influx rate) multiplied by a global scaling factor for each subject. One challenge in applying RP to a short scan duration (e.g., 20 min) is the resulting high noise in the parametric images. We applied a self-supervised deep-kernel method for noise reduction. Using the standard Patlak plot as the reference, the RP method was evaluated for lesion quantification, lesion-to-background contrast, and myocardial visualization in total-body parametric imaging in 22 human subjects (12 healthy subjects and 10 cancer patients) who underwent a 1-h dynamic18F-FDG scan. The RP method was also applied to the dynamic data reconstructed from a clinical standard 20-min list-mode scan either at 1 or 2 h after injection for 2 cancer patients.Results:We demonstrated that it is feasible to obtain high-quality parametric images from 20-min scans using RP parametric imaging with a self-supervised deep-kernel noise-reduction strategy. The RP slope' was highly correlated with the standard Patlakin lesions and major organs, demonstrating its quantitative potential across subjects. Compared with conventional SUVs, the' images significantly improved lesion contrast and enabled visualization of the myocardium for potential cardiac assessment. The application of the RP parametric imaging to the 2 clinical scans also showed similar benefits.Conclusion:Using total-body PET with the RP approach, it is feasible to generate parametric images using data from a 20-min clinical list-mode scan.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40015921/
Quantitative evaluation of 11C-ABP688 as PET ligand for the measurement of the metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5 using autoradiographic studies and a beta-scintillator,"Matthias T Wyss, Simon M Ametamey, Valerie Treyer, Andrea Bettio, Milen Blagoev, Lea J Kessler, Cyrill Burger, Bruno Weber, Mark Schmidt, Fabrizio Gasparini, Alfred Buck","In this study we assessed the new glutamatergic ligand (11)C-ABP688 with regard to the following characteristics: (A) brain distribution, (B) first pass extraction fraction, (C) suitable model to describe tracer kinetics and (D) specificity for the mGlu5 receptor. These parameters were assessed using autoradiography and a beta-scintillator positioned in the striatum. The study included 13 male rats. In 2 animals cerebral blood flow was measured using H(2)(15)O. The (11)C-ABP688 data were analyzed using compartmental modeling. A two-tissue compartment model turned out to fit the data more adequately (parameters: K(1), k(2)('), k(3)('), k(4), total distribution volume DV(tot)=K(1)/k(2)(') (1+k(3)(')/k(4)) than a one-tissue compartment model. The autoradiographic studies revealed high uptake in hippocampus, striatum and cortex and low accumulation in thalamus and cerebellum. The uptake was markedly reduced following blockade with the mGlu5 antagonist M-MPEP. The first pass extraction fraction exceeded 85%. Baseline DV(tot) was 15.16+/-2.67 ml plasma/ml tissue and decreased by 56, 67 and 72% following blockade with 1, 2 and 6 mg/kg M-MPEP, respectively. These results show that (11)C-ABP688 is a promising PET ligand for the quantification of mGlu5 receptors in humans and animals. It readily crosses the blood-brain barrier and binds with high specificity to the mGlu5 receptor. The study furthermore demonstrates the usefulness of a beta-scintillator, if necessary in connection with autoradiography, to evaluate new receptor tracers.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17320417/
Parametric image reconstruction using spectral analysis of PET projection data,"S R Meikle, J C Matthews, V J Cunningham, D L Bailey, L Livieratos, T Jones, P Price","Spectral analysis is a general modelling approach that enables calculation of parametric images from reconstructed tracer kinetic data independent of an assumed compartmental structure. We investigated the validity of applying spectral analysis directly to projection data motivated by the advantages that: (i) the number of reconstructions is reduced by an order of magnitude and (ii) iterative reconstruction becomes practical which may improve signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). A dynamic software phantom with typical 2-[11C]thymidine kinetics was used to compare projection-based and image-based methods and to assess bias-variance trade-offs using iterative expectation maximization (EM) reconstruction. We found that the two approaches are not exactly equivalent due to properties of the non-negative least-squares algorithm. However, the differences are small (< 5%) and mainly affect parameters related to early and late time points on the impulse response function (K1 and, to a lesser extent, VD). The optimal number of EM iteration was 15-30 with up to a two-fold improvement in SNR over filtered back projection. We conclude that projection-based spectral analysis with EM reconstruction yields accurate parametric images with high SNR and has potential application to a wide range of positron emission tomography ligands.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9533143/
Comparison of first pass bolus AIFs extracted from sequential 18F-FDG PET and DSC-MRI of mice,"Eleanor Evans, Stephen J Sawiak, Alexander O Ward, Guido Buonincontri, Robert C Hawkes, T Adrian Carpenter","Accurate kinetic modelling of in vivo physiological function using positron emission tomography (PET) requires determination of the tracer time-activity curve in plasma, known as the arterial input function (AIF). The AIF is usually determined by invasive blood sampling methods, which are prohibitive in murine studies due to low total blood volumes. Extracting AIFs from PET images is also challenging due to large partial volume effects (PVE). We hypothesise that in combined PET with magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MR), a co-injected bolus of MR contrast agent and PET ligand can be tracked using fast MR acquisitions. This protocol would allow extraction of a MR AIF from MR contrast agent concentration-time curves, at higher spatial and temporal resolution than an image-derived PET AIF. A conversion factor could then be applied to the MR AIF for use in PET kinetic analysis. This work has compared AIFs obtained from sequential DSC-MRI and PET with separate injections of gadolinium contrast agent and18F-FDG respectively to ascertain the technique's validity. An automated voxel selection algorithm was employed to improve MR AIF reproducibility. We found that MR and PET AIFs displayed similar character in the first pass, confirmed by gamma variate fits (p<0.02). MR AIFs displayed reduced PVE compared to PET AIFs, indicating their potential use in PET/MR studies.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26213433/
11C-PK11195 plasma metabolization has the same rate in multiple sclerosis patients and healthy controls: a cross-sectional study,"Aline Morais de Souza, Milena Sales Pitombeira, Larissa Estessi de Souza, Fabio Luiz Navarro Marques, Carlos Alberto Buchpiguel, Caroline Cristiano Real, Daniele de Paula Faria","11C-PK11195 is a positron emitter tracer used for Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging of innate immune cell activation in studies of neuroinflammatory diseases. For the image quantitative analysis, it is necessary to quantify the intact fraction of this tracer in the arterial plasma during imaging acquisition (plasma intact fraction). Due to the complexity and costs involved in this analysis it is important to evaluate the real necessity of individual analysis in each11C-PK11195 PET imaging acquisition. The purpose of this study is to compare11C-PK11195 plasma metabolization rate between healthy controls and multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and evaluate the interference of sex, age, treatment, and disease phenotype in the tracer intact fraction measured in arterial plasma samples.11C-PK11195 metabolization rate in arterial plasma was quantified by high performance liquid chromatography in samples from MS patients (n = 50) and healthy controls (n = 23) at 20, 45, and 60 minutes after11C-PK11195 injection. Analyses were also stratified by sex, age, treatment type, and MS phenotype. The results showed no significant differences in the metabolization rate of healthy controls and MS patients, or in the stratified samples. In conclusion,11C-PK11195 metabolization has the same rate in patients with MS and healthy controls, which is not affected by sex, age, treatment, and disease phenotype. Thus, these findings could contribute to exempting the necessity for tracer metabolization determination in all11C-PK11195 PET imaging acquisition, by using a population metabolization rate average. The study procedures were approved by the Ethics Committee for Research Projects Analysis of the Hospital das Clinicas of the University of Sao Paulo Medical School (approval No. 624.065) on April 23, 2014.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33907039/
Reaction rate constant: a theoretical description from local temperature,"Saba Valatoon, Mojtaba Alipour","Application of various descriptors based on electron density and its associated quantities to quantify chemical reactivity within the conceptual density functional theory has recently come into spotlight. Among others and particularly relevant to our study, local temperature based on electron density as well as kinetic energy density, as a measure of the kinetic energy of an electron moving in the Kohn-Sham potential of systems, should be mentioned. In this work, we propose to use the local temperature for describing the reaction rate constant, where our main idea originates from the point that the smaller the local temperature at the reaction center, the easier the electron removal, leading to a larger rate constant. On the basis of theoretical considerations, it is proved that the rate constant variations caused by the substituent effects can well be proportional to the local temperature at the reaction center. In order to numerically validate our proposed approach, we have taken the phenol derivatives with the available experimental rate constants of theirO-methylation reaction as working models. The reason for this choice is that one of the most versatile approaches for labeling biologically active compounds with the11C nuclide for positron emission tomography (PET) is methylation by methyl iodide including11C nuclide, [11C]MeI, where methylation of phenolic oxygen with [11C]MeI is utilized to label some important tracers for PET studies. Our results unveil that the local temperature changes at the reaction center of the aforementioned reaction are reasonably correlated with the rate constant variations. Hopefully, incorporating the proposed correlations between the local temperature and the kinetics data into a computer control algorithm not only provides a simple tool for predicting the rate constant of theO-methylation reaction for other substituted phenols, but also, as a part of the chemical artificial intelligence, the optimum [11C]MeI labeling conditions for a wide variety of phenol derivatives can be controlled.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38726725/
Comparison of analytical methods of brain [18F]FDG-PET after severe traumatic brain injury,"Karine Madsen, Sara Hesby, Ingrid Poulsen, Stefan Fuglsang, Jesper Graff, Karen B Larsen, Lars P Kammersgaard, Ian Law, Hartwig R Siebner","Background: Loss of consciousness has been shown to reduce cerebral metabolic rates of glucose (CMRglc) measured by brain [18F]FDG-PET. Measurements of regional metabolic patterns by normalization to global cerebral metabolism or cerebellum may underestimate widespread reductions.

New method: The aim of this study was to compare quantification methods of whole brain glucose metabolism, including whole brain [18F]FDG uptake normalized to uptake in cerebellum, normalized to injected activity, normalized to plasma tracer concentration, and two methods for estimating CMRglc. Six patients suffering from severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) and ten healthy controls (HC) underwent a 10min static [18F]FDG-PET scan and venous blood sampling.

Results: Except from normalizing to cerebellum, all quantification methods found significant lower level of whole brain glucose metabolism of 25-33% in TBI patients compared to HC. In accordance these measurements correlated to level of consciousness.

Comparison with existing methods: Our study demonstrates that the analysis method of the [18F]FDG PET data has a substantial impact on the estimated whole brain cerebral glucose metabolism in patients with severe TBI. Importantly, the SUVR method which is often used in a clinical setting was not able to distinguish patients with severe TBI from HC at the whole-brain level.

Conclusion: We recommend supplementing a static [18F]FDG scan with a single venous blood sample in future studies of patients with severe TBI or reduced level of consciousness. This can be used for simple semi-quantitative uptake values by normalizing brain activity uptake to plasma tracer concentration, or quantitative estimates of CMRglc.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28811199/
A hybrid clustering method for ROI delineation in small-animal dynamic PET images: application to the automatic estimation of FDG input functions,"Xiujuan Zheng, Guangjian Tian, Sung-Cheng Huang, Dagan Feng","Tracer kinetic modeling with dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) requires a plasma time-activity curve (PTAC) as an input function. Several image-derived input function (IDIF) methods that rely on drawing the region of interest (ROI) in large vascular structures have been proposed to overcome the problems caused by the invasive approach for obtaining the PTAC, especially for small-animal studies. However, the manual placement of ROIs for estimating IDIF is subjective and labor-intensive, making it an undesirable and unreliable process. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid clustering method (HCM) that objectively delineates ROIs in dynamic PET images for the estimation of IDIFs, and demonstrate its application to the mouse PET studies acquired with [ (18)F]Fluoro-2-deoxy-2-D-glucose (FDG). We begin our HCM using k-means clustering for background removal. We then model the time-activity curves using polynomial regression mixture models in curve clustering for heart structure detection. The hierarchical clustering is finally applied for ROI refinements. The HCM achieved accurate ROI delineation in both computer simulations and experimental mouse studies. In the mouse studies, the predicted IDIF had a high correlation with the gold standard, the PTAC derived from the invasive blood samples. The results indicate that the proposed HCM has a great potential in ROI delineation for automatic estimation of IDIF in dynamic FDG-PET studies.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20952342/
Use of ridge regression for improved estimation of kinetic constants from PET data,"F O'Sullivan, A Saha","The estimation of parameters in radio-tracer models from positron emission tomography (PET) data by nonlinear least squares (NLS) often leads to results with unacceptable mean square error (ME) characteristics. The introduction of constraints on parameters has the potential to address this problem. We examine a ridge-regression technique that augments the standard NLS criterion by the addition of a term which penalizes estimates which deviate from physiologically reasonable values. A variation on a plug-in methodology of Hoerl et al. [7] is examined for data-dependent selection of the degree of reliance to place on the penalizing term. A simulation study is carried out to evaluate the performance of this approach in the context of estimation of kinetic constants in the three-compartment model used to analyze data from PET studies with fluoro-deoxyglucose (FDG). Results show that over a range of realistic noise levels, the ridge-regression procedure can be expected to reduce the root ME of parameter estimates by 60%. This result is not found to be substantially dependent on the precise formulation of the penalty function used. Thus, the use of ridge regression for estimation of kinetic parameters in PET studies is considered to be a promising tool.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10232668/
Improved parametric image generation using spatial-temporal analysis of dynamic PET studies,"Yun Zhou, Sung-Cheng Huang, Marvin Bergsneider, Dean F Wong","The value of parametric images that represent both spatial distribution and quantification of the physiological parameters of tracer kinetics has long been recognized. However, the inherent high noise level of pixel kinetics of dynamic PET makes it unsuitable to generate parametric images of the microparameters of tracer kinetic model by conventional weighted nonlinear least squares (WNLS) fitting. Based on the concept that both spatial and temporal information should be integrated to improve parametric image quality, a nonlinear ridge regression with spatial constraint (NLRRSC) parametric imaging algorithm was proposed in this study. For NLRRSC, a term that penalizes local spatial variation of parameters was added to the cost function of WNLS fitting. The initial estimates and spatial constraint were estimated by component representation model (CRM) with cluster analysis. A hierarchical cluster with average linkage method was used to extract components. The ridge parameter was determined by linear ridge regression theory at each iteration, and a modified Gauss-Newton algorithm was used for minimizing the cost function. Results from a computer simulation showed that the percent mean square error of estimates obtained by NLRRSC can be decreased by 60-80% compared to that of WNLS. The parametric images estimated by NLRRSC are significantly better than the ones generated by WNLS. A highly correlated linear relationship was found between the ROI values calculated from the microparametric images generated by NLRRSC and estimates from ROI kinetic fitting. NLRRSC provided a reliable estimate of glucose metabolite uptake rate with a comparable image quality compared to Patlak analysis. In conclusion, NLRRSC is a reliable and robust parametric imaging algorithm for dynamic PET studies.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11848713/
"[18F]BIBD-239: 18F-Labeled ER176, a Positron Emission Tomography Tracer Specific for the Translocator Protein","Hualong Chen, Zeng Jiang, Xuebo Cheng, Wei Zheng, Yuli Sun, Ziyue Yu, Tingyu Yang, Lu Zhang, Jun Yan, Yajing Liu, Xunming Ji, Zehui Wu","[11C]ER176 has adequate sensitivity to image the human brain translocator protein (TSPO) in all three genotypes by positron emission tomography (PET). However, its clinical application is limited by the short half-life of11C (20.38 min). To overcome the deficiency of [11C]ER176 and keep the pharmacophore features of ER176 to the maximum extent, we designed four fluorine-labeled ER176 derivatives using the deuterium method. In vitro competition binding confirmed that the designed compounds had high affinity for TSPO. Biodistribution experiments showed that tissues with high expression of TSPO had high uptake of these compounds, as well as that the compound showed high brain penetration and mild defluorination in vivo. Therefore, [18F]BIBD-239 with simple synthesis conditions was selected for further biological evaluation. Theoretical simulations showed that BIBD-239 and ER176 have similar binding modes and sites to Ala147-TSPO and Thr147-TSPO, which indicated that the tracers may have consistent sensitivity to the three affinity genotypes. In vitro autoradiography and in vivo PET studies of the ischemic rat brain showed dramatically higher uptake of [18F]BIBD-239 on the lesion site compared to the contralateral side with good brain kinetics. Additionally, [18F]BIBD-239 provided clear tumor PET images in a GL261 glioma model. Importantly, PET imaging and liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) results showed that in vivo defluorination and other metabolites of [18F]BIBD-239 did not interfere with brain imaging. Conclusively, [18F]BIBD-239, similar to ER176 with low polymorphism sensitivity, has simple labeling conditions, high labeling yield, high affinity, and high specificity for TSPO, and it is planned for further evaluation in higher species.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35671264/
Quantification of myocardial blood flow using 13N-ammonia and PET: comparison of tracer models,"Y Choi, S C Huang, R A Hawkins, J Y Kim, B T Kim, C K Hoh, K Chen, M E Phelps, H R Schelbert","Several tracer kinetic methods have been proposed for quantification of regional myocardial blood flow (MBF) with 13N-ammonia and PET. Merits and limitations specific to each approach, however, generally are not clear, because they have not been evaluated in the same experimental environment. Therefore, we compared six different commonly used methods (11 modifications) to characterize the accuracy of each approach. The methods included the two-parameter model (method 1), the modified two-parameter model (method 2), the four-parameter model (method 3), the graphical analysis (method 4), the first-pass extraction method (method 5) and the dose uptake index (DUI; method 6).

Methods: Eleven studies in four dogs, 16 studies in eight healthy human volunteers and 14 studies in seven patients were performed using 13N-ammonia and PET. MBF in dogs was varied with dipyridamole and coronary occlusions and was measured independently and simultaneously with microspheres. Volunteers and patients were studied at baseline and after dipyridamole. MBF and DUI were estimated using a time-activity curve (Qi[t]) derived from dynamic images and regions of interest (ROls) and using the six methods. DUI was defined as Qi(t = 2 min) x weight/dose.

Results: MBF estimated by methods 1-5 correlated well with microsphere MBF in dogs. MBF estimates by method 1 correlated well with those by methods 2, 4 and 5 and to a lesser degree with those by method 3 in both dog and human studies. DUI correlated poorly with MBF by microspheres and by methods 1-5 in both dog and human studies. MBF estimates by method 3 showed larger dispersion (SD/mean flow) and higher sensitivity to metabolites correction in arterial blood than those by methods 1, 2, 4 and 5.

Conclusion: MBF can be measured accurately using 13N-ammonia PET and tracer kinetic methods. DUI is a poor indicator of MBF values. The results indicate that preference should be given to the two-parameter model, incorporating geometrical ROI representation (method 2) among the compartment models, and to the graphical analysis (method 4) among the noncompartmental approaches.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10452323/
Image-derived input function for assessment of 18F-FDG uptake by the inflamed lung,"Tobias Schroeder, Marcos F Vidal Melo, Guido Musch, R Scott Harris, Jose G Venegas, Tilo Winkler","Pulmonary uptake of (18)F-FDG assessed with PET has been used to quantify the metabolic activity of inflammatory cells in the lung. This assessment involves modeling of tracer kinetics and knowledge of a time-activity curve in pulmonary artery plasma as an input function, usually acquired by manual blood sampling. This paper presents and validates a method to accurately derive an input function from a blood-pool region of interest (ROI) defined in dynamic PET images.

Methods: The method is based on a 2-parameter model describing the activity of blood and that from spillover into the time-activity curve for the ROI. The model parameters are determined using an iterative algorithm, with 2 blood samples used to calibrate the raw PET-derived activity data. We validated both the 2-parameter model and the method to derive a quantitative input function from ROIs defined for the cavities of the right and left heart and for the descending aorta by comparing them against the time-activity curve obtained by manual blood sampling from the pulmonary artery in lungs with acute inflammation.

Results: The model accurately described the time-activity curve from sampled blood. The 2-sample calibration method provided an efficient algorithm to derive input functions that were virtually identical to those sampled manually, including the fast kinetics of the early phase. The (18)F-FDG uptake rates in acutely injured lungs obtained using this method correlated well with those obtained exclusively using manual blood sampling (R(2) > 0.993). Within some bounds, the model was found quite insensitive to the timing of calibration blood samples or the exact definition of the blood-pool ROIs.

Conclusion: Using 2 mixed venous blood samples, the method accurately assesses the entire time course of the pulmonary (18)F-FDG input function and does not require the precise geometry of a specific blood-pool ROI or a population-based input function. This method may substantially facilitate studies involving modeling of pulmonary (18)F-FDG in patients with viral or bacterial infections, pulmonary fibrosis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17942803/
Clinical evaluation of carbon-11-phenylephrine: MAO-sensitive marker of cardiac sympathetic neurons,"D M Raffel, J R Corbett, R B del Rosario, D L Gildersleeve, P C Chiao, M Schwaiger, D M Wieland","The sympathomimetic drug phenylephrine recently has been labeled with 11C for use in PET studies of cardiac sympathetic innervation. Previous reports using isolated perfused rat heart models indicate that phenylephrine is metabolized by intraneuronal monoamine oxidase (MAO). This report compares the imaging characteristics, neuronal selectivity and kinetics of (-)-[11C]phenylephrine (PHEN) to the structurally similar but MAO-resistant analog (-)-[11C]-meta-hydroxyephedrine (HED), an established heart neuronal marker.

Methods: Fourteen healthy volunteers were studied with PET and PHEN. Ten had paired studies with HED; four of the 10 were scanned a second time with each tracer after oral administration of desipramine, a selective neuronal transport blocker. Hemodynamic and electrocardiographic responses were monitored. Blood levels of intact radiotracer and radiolabeled metabolites were determined from venous blood samples taken during the PET study. Myocardial retention indices for both tracers were calculated.

Results: No hemodynamic or electrocardiographic effects were observed with either tracer. PHEN showed reduced myocardial retention at 50 min compared to HED; however, image quality and uniformity of distribution were comparable. PHEN cleared from myocardium with a mean half-time of 59 +/- 5 min, while myocardial levels of HED remained constant. PHEN metabolites appeared in the blood approximately three times faster than HED metabolites. Desipramine pretreatment markedly reduced (> 60%) myocardial retention of both PHEN and HED.

Conclusion: PHEN provides PET images of human heart comparable in quality and uniformity to HED. Like HED, PHEN localizes in the sympathetic nerves of the heart. However, the more rapid efflux of PHEN, that is likely mediated by MAO, may provide information on the functional status of cardiac sympathetic neurons unobtainable with HED.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8970507/
Positron emission tomography,A A Lammertsma,"Positron emission tomography (PET) allows for the absolute measurement of regional tissue physiological, biochemical and pharmacological processes. This ability is a consequence of the nature of positron emission and the type of tracers which can be labelled with positron emitting radionuclides. The spatial resolution of state of the art scanners is in the order of 4 mm full width at half maximum (FWHM). However, due to statistical limitations, in practice normally a resolution of 7 to 8 mm FWHM is used. For the same reason, although there is no limit to the temporal resolution, studies usually require many seconds to several minutes to obtain a good signal to noise ratio. If a slow kinetic process is followed, studies can be extended to several hours in order to characterise the entire physiological process. A major advantage of PET is its flexibility. Several parameters (e.g., blood flow, oxygen consumption, glucose consumption, receptor density, etc.) can be measured in the same setting. Different aspects of a certain pathology can, therefore, be studied in the same patient.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1489639/
Neuropharmacology and receptor studies in the elderly,C C Meltzer,"Functional brain imaging has provided unique and exciting opportunities to strengthen our knowledge of the biologic substrate of the aging brain and neuropsychiatric disorders. Positron emission tomography (PET) is a particularly powerful tool for quantifying the neurobiologic correlates of cognition, mood, and behavior. Initial PET studies of aging, psychiatric disorders, and neurodegenerative disease focused primarily on generalized physiologic parameters such as cerebral blood flow and metabolism, and early neuroreceptor imaging studies relied on relatively nonselective markers. New, selective receptor radioligands now offer a previously inaccessible means to investigate the dynamic relationships among neurochemistry, aging, and psychopathology in vivo. This approach has substantial advantages over peripheral (platelet and cerebrospinal fluid) markers, neuroendocrine challenge studies, animal models, and postmortem receptor binding assays. Advances in tracer kinetic modeling, magnetic resonance imaging facilitated PET image analysis, radiochemistry techniques, instrumentation, and image processing have helped pave the way for increased emphasis on functional imaging studies of neuropsychiatric disorders. The capability to correct PET image data for the confounding effect of cerebral atrophy permits relationships among age-related brain changes and neurobiologic disease mechanisms to be more accurately examined in the elderly.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10593702/
Distribution of zolmitriptan into the CNS in healthy volunteers: a positron emission tomography study,"Anders Wall, Matts Kågedal, Mats Bergström, Eva Jacobsson, Dag Nilsson, Gunnar Antoni, Pernilla Frändberg, Sven-Ake Gustavsson, Bengt Långström, Roger Yates","Objective: Triptans are highly effective in the treatment of migraine. Both central and peripheral mechanisms of action have been suggested. Until now, firm data about the passage of triptans into the CNS in humans have been lacking. The aim of the current study was to evaluate, using positron emission tomography (PET), the uptake and distribution of zolmitriptan into the CNS after intranasal administration.

Subjects and methods: Eight healthy volunteers, five males and three females (mean ages 23 and 26 years, respectively), were included. Radioactive [carbonyl-11C]zolmitriptan was infused intravenously for 5 minutes on two occasions: once alone, and once 30-40 minutes after intranasal administration of unlabelled zolmitriptan 5 mg. PET was used to measure the concentration of labelled zolmitriptan in the brain, from the start of the tracer infusion for 90 minutes. Regional cerebral blood volume was determined with [15O]carbon monoxide. In addition, an MRI scan was performed to obtain anatomical information. The PET images were analysed quantitatively for different areas of the brain, generating [11C]zolmitriptan time-activity data corrected for circulating tracer activity. The rate of uptake of intranasal zolmitriptan into the CNS was estimated by kinetic modelling using the PET data.

Results: PET data from this study demonstrate a rapid dose-proportional uptake of [11C]zolmitriptan into the brain. Significant concentrations of [11C]zolmitriptan were found in all brain regions studied. Calculated CNS concentrations after intranasal zolmitriptan administration showed a gradual increase, reaching about 2 nM (0.5 microg/L) 30 minutes after administration and 3.5 nM (1.0 microg/L), or one-fifth of the plasma concentration, 1 hour after administration. Five minutes after zolmitriptan administration, the mean CNS concentration had already reached 0.5 nM, which is higher than in vitro values for initiation of the agonistic action on 5-HT(1B/1D) receptors.

Conclusion: This study demonstrates by direct measurements that zolmitriptan enters the brain parenchyma in humans, achieving an uptake rate and concentration compatible with a central mode of action.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15869317/
"Analysis of dynamic radioligand displacement or ""activation"" studies","K J Friston, A L Malizia, S Wilson, V J Cunningham, T Jones, D J Nutt","We present a simple way of assessing dynamic or time-dependent changes in displacement during single-subject radioligand positron emission tomography (PET) activation studies. The approach is designed to facilitate dynamic activation studies using selective radioligands. These studies are, in principle, capable of characterising functional neurochemistry by analogy with the study of functional neuroanatomy using rCBF activation studies. The proposed approach combines time-dependent compartmental models of tracer kinetics and the general linear model used in statistical parametric mapping. This provides for a comprehensive, voxel-based and data-led assessment of regionally specific effects. The statistical model proposed in this paper is predicated on a single-compartment model extended to allow for time-dependent changes in kinetics. We have addressed the sensitivity and specificity of the analysis, as it would be used operationally, by applying the analysis to 11C-Flumazenil dynamic displacement studies. The activation used in this demonstration study was a pharmacological (i.v. midazolam) challenge, 30 min after administration of the tracer. We were able to demonstrate, and make statistical inferences about, regional increases in k2 (or decreases in the volume of distribution) in prefrontal and other cortical areas.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8978390/
Assessing dynamic metabolic heterogeneity in prostate cancer patients via total-body [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT imaging: quantitative analysis of [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 uptake in pathological lesions and normal organs,"Ruohua Chen, Yee Ling Ng, Xinlan Yang, Yinjie Zhu, Lianghua Li, Haitao Zhao, Gang Huang, Jianjun Liu","Purpose: This study aimed to quantitatively assess [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 uptake in pathological lesions and normal organs in prostate cancer using the total-body [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT and to characterize the dynamic metabolic heterogeneity of prostate cancer.

Methods: Dynamic total-body [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT scans were performed on ten prostate cancer patients. Manual delineation of volume-of-interests (VOIs) was performed on multiple normal organs displaying high [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 uptake, as well as pathological lesions. Time-to-activity curves (TACs) were generated, and the four compartment models including one-tissue compartmental model (1T1k), reversible one-tissue compartmental model (1T2k), irreversible two-tissue compartment model (2T3k) and reversible two-tissue compartmental model (2T4k) were fitted to each tissue TAC. Various rate constants, including K1(forward transport rate from plasma to the reversible compartment), k2(reverse transport rate from the reversible compartment to plasma), k3(tracer binding on the PSMA-receptor and its internalization), k4(the externalization rate of the tracer) and Ki(net influx rate), were obtained. The selection of the optimal model for describing the uptake of both lesions and normal organs was determined using the Akaike information criteria (AIC). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to determine the cut-off values for differentiating physiological and pathological [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 uptake.

Results: Both 1T1k and 1T2k models showed relatively high AIC values compared to the 2T3k and 2T4k models in both pathological lesions and normal organs. The kinetic behavior of pathological lesions was better described by the 2T3k model compared to the 2T4k model, while the normal organs were better described by the 2T4k model. Significant variations in kinetic metrics, such as K1, k2, and k3, and Ki, were observed among normal organs with high [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 uptake and pathological lesions. The high Kivalue in normal organs was primarily determined by elevated K1and low k3, rather than k2. Conversely, the high Kivalue in pathological lesions, ranking second to the kidney and similar to salivary glands and spleen, was predominantly determined by the highest k3value. Notably, k3exhibited the highest performance in distinguishing between physiological and pathological [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 uptake, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.844 (95% CI, 0.773-0.915), sensitivity of 82.9%, and specificity of 74.1%. The k3values showed better performance than SUVmean (AUC, 0.659), SUVmax (AUC, 0.637), and other kinetic parameter including K1(AUC, 0.604), k2(AUC, 0.634), and Ki(AUC, 0.651).

Conclusions: Significant discrepancies in kinetic metrics were detected between pathological lesions and normal organs, despite their shared high uptake of [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11. Notably, the k3value exhibits a noteworthy capability to distinguish between pathological lesions and normal organs with elevated [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 uptake. This discovery implies that k3holds promise as a prospective imaging biomarker for distinguishing between pathologic and non-specific [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 uptake in patients with prostate cancer.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37889299/
Novel 18F-Labeled κ-Opioid Receptor Antagonist as PET Radiotracer: Synthesis and In Vivo Evaluation of 18F-LY2459989 in Nonhuman Primates,"Songye Li, Zhengxin Cai, Ming-Qiang Zheng, Daniel Holden, Mika Naganawa, Shu-Fei Lin, Jim Ropchan, David Labaree, Michael Kapinos, Teresa Lara-Jaime, Antonio Navarro, Yiyun Huang","The κ-opioid receptor (KOR) has been implicated in depression, addictions, and other central nervous system disorders and, thus, is an important target for drug development. We previously developed several11C-labeled PET radiotracers for KOR imaging in humans. Here we report the synthesis and evaluation of18F-LY2459989 as the first18F-labeled KOR antagonist radiotracer in nonhuman primates and its comparison with11C-LY2459989.Methods:The novel radioligand18F-LY2459989 was synthesized by18F displacement of a nitro group or an iodonium ylide. PET scans in rhesus monkeys were obtained on a small-animal scanner to assess the pharmacokinetic and in vivo binding properties of the ligand. Metabolite-corrected arterial activity curves were measured and used as input functions in the analysis of brain time-activity curves and the calculation of binding parameters.Results:With the iodonium ylide precursor,18F-LY2459989 was prepared at high radiochemical yield (36% ± 7% [mean ± SD]), radiochemical purity (>99%), and mean molar activity (1,175 GBq/μmol;n= 6). In monkeys,18F-LY2459989 was metabolized at a moderate rate, with a parent fraction of approximately 35% at 30 min after injection. Fast and reversible kinetics were observed, with a regional peak uptake time of less than 20 min. Pretreatment with the selective KOR antagonist LY2456302 (0.1 mg/kg) decreased the activity level in regions with high levels of binding to that in the cerebellum, thus demonstrating the binding specificity and selectivity of18F-LY2459989 in vivo. Regional time-activity curves were well fitted by the multilinear analysis 1 kinetic model to derive reliable estimates of regional distribution volumes. With the cerebellum as the reference region, regional binding potentials were calculated and ranked as follows: cingulate cortex > insula > caudate/putamen > frontal cortex > temporal cortex > thalamus, consistent with the reported KOR distribution in the monkey brain.Conclusion:The evaluation of18F-LY2459989 in nonhuman primates demonstrated many attractive imaging properties: fast tissue kinetics, specific and selective binding to the KOR, and high specific binding signals. A side-by-side comparison of18F-LY2459989 and11C-LY2459989 indicated similar kinetic and binding profiles for the 2 radiotracers. Taken together, the results indicated that18F-LY2459989 appears to be an excellent PET radiotracer for the imaging and quantification of the KOR in vivo.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28747521/
In vivo PET imaging of cardiac presynaptic sympathoneuronal mechanisms in the rat,"Dnyanesh N Tipre, James J Fox, Daniel P Holt, Gilbert Green, Jianhua Yu, Martin Pomper, Robert F Dannals, Frank M Bengel","The sympathetic nervous system of the heart plays a key role in the pathophysiology of various cardiac diseases. Small-animal models are valuable for obtaining further insight into mechanisms of cardiac disease and therapy. To determine the translational potential of cardiac neuronal imaging from rodents to humans, we characterized the rat sympathetic nervous system using 3 radiotracers that reflect different subcellular mechanisms: (11)C-meta-hydroxyephedrine (HED), a tracer of neuronal transport showing stable uptake and no washout in healthy humans; (11)C-phenylephrine (PHEN), a tracer of vesicular leakage and intraneuronal metabolic degradation with initial uptake and subsequent washout in humans; and (11)C-epinephrine (EPI), a tracer of vesicular storage with stable uptake and no washout in humans.

Methods: We used a small-animal PET system to study healthy male Wistar rats at baseline, after desipramine (DMI) pretreatment (DMI block), and with DMI injection 15 min after tracer delivery (DMI chase). The rats were kept under general isoflurane anesthesia while dynamic emission scans of the heart were recorded for 60 min after radiotracer injection. A myocardial retention index was determined by normalizing uptake at 40 min to the integral under the arterial input curve. Washout rates were determined by monoexponential fitting of myocardial time-activity curves.

Results: At baseline, HED showed high myocardial uptake and sustained retention, EPI showed moderate uptake and significant biphasic washout, and PHEN showed moderate uptake and monoexponential washout. The average (+/- SD) left ventricular retention index for HED, PHEN, and EPI was 7.38% +/- 0.82%/min, 3.43% +/- 0.45%/min, and 4.24% +/- 0.59%/min, respectively; the washout rate for HED, PHEN, and EPI was 0.13% +/- 0.23%/min, 1.13% +/- 0.35%/min, and 0.50% +/- 0.24%/min, respectively. The DMI chase resulted in increased washout only for HED. DMI block decreased myocardial uptake of all tracers by less than 90%.

Conclusion: Kinetic profiles of HED in the rat myocardium were similar to those of HED in humans, suggesting comparable neuronal transport density. Unlike in humans, however, significant washout of EPI and faster washout of PHEN were encountered, consistent with high intraneuronal metabolic activity, high catecholamine turnover, and reduced vesicular storage. This evidence of increased neuronal activity in rodents has implications for translational studies of cardiac neuronal biology in humans.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18552143/
Kinetic analysis of 2-[carbon-11]thymidine PET imaging studies: compartmental model and mathematical analysis,"D A Mankoff, A F Shields, M M Graham, J M Link, J F Eary, K A Krohn","Carbon-11-thymidine is a PET tracer of DNA synthesis and cellular proliferation. Quantitative analysis of [11C]thymidine images is complicated by the presence of significant quantities of labeled metabolites. Estimation of the rate of thymidine incorporation into DNA using [11C]thymidine requires a kinetic model that is capable of describing the behavior of thymidine and labeled metabolites.

Methods: Based on previous studies with labeled thymidine, we constructed a five-compartment model describing the kinetic behavior of 2-[11C]thymidine and its labeled metabolites. In addition, we have performed a series of calculations and simulations to calculate the sensitivity and identifiability of model parameters to estimate the extent to which individual parameters can be estimated; to determine appropriate model constraints necessary for reproducible estimates of the constant describing flux of thymidine from the blood into DNA, i.e., thymidine flux constant; and to determine the potential accuracy of model parameter and thymidine flux constant estimates from PET imaging data.

Results: The underlying assumptions in the thymidine compartmental model lead to a description of the thymidine flux constant for DNA incorporation in terms of model parameters. Sensitivity and identifiability analyses suggest that the model parameters pertaining to labeled metabolites will be difficult to estimate independently of the thymidine parameters. Exact evaluation of the kinetic parameters of the labeled metabolites is not the principal goal of this model. Simulations were performed that suggest that it is preferable to tightly constrain these parameters to preset values near the center of their expected ranges. Although it is difficult to estimate individual thymidine model parameters, the flux constant for incorporation into DNA can be accurately estimated (r > 0.9 for estimated versus true simulated flux constant). Flux constant estimates are not affected by modest levels of local degradation of thymidine that may occur in proliferating tissue.

Conclusion: By using a kinetic model for thymidine and labeled metabolites, it is possible to estimate the flux of thymidine uptake and incorporation into DNA and, thereby, noninvasively estimate regional cellular proliferation using [11C]thymidine and PET.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9627342/
"In vivo imaging of neuroinflammation: a comparative study between [(18)F]PBR111, [ (11)C]CLINME and [ (11)C]PK11195 in an acute rodent model","Nadja Van Camp, Raphael Boisgard, Bertrand Kuhnast, Benoit Thézé, Thomas Viel, Marie-Claude Grégoire, Fabien Chauveau, Hervé Boutin, Andrew Katsifis, Frédéric Dollé, Bertrand Tavitian","Purpose: The key role of neuroinflammation in acute and chronic neurological disorders has stimulated the search for specific radiotracers targeting the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR)/18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO), a hallmark of neuroinflammation. Here we evaluate the new radiotracer for positron emission tomography (PET) [(18)F]PBR111 in a rodent model of acute inflammation and compare it with [(11)C]CLINME, an (11)C-labelled tracer of the same chemical family, and with the isoquinolinic carboxamide [(11)C]PK11195.

Methods: We studied radiometabolites by HPLC, in vitro binding by autoradiography and in vivo brain kinetics as well as in vivo specificity of binding using PET imaging.

Results: We show that this radiotracer has a high in vitro specificity for PBR/TSPO versus central benzodiazepine receptors, as reflected by the drastic reduction of its binding to target tissue by addition of PK11195 or PBR111, while addition of flumazenil does not affect binding. Only intact [(18)F]PBR111 is detected in brain up to 60 min after i.v. injection, and PET imaging shows an increased uptake in the lesion as compared to the contralateral side as early as 6 min after injection. Administration of an excess of PK11195 and PBR111, 20 min after [(18)F]PBR111 administration, induces a rapid and complete displacement of [(18)F]PBR111 binding from the lesion. Modelling of the PET data using the simplified reference tissue model showed increased binding potential (BP) in comparison to [(11)C]PK11195.

Conclusion: [(18)F]PBR111 is a metabolically stable tracer with a high specific in vitro and in vivo binding to TSPO. In addition, considering the longer half-life of (18)F over (11)C, these results support [(18)F]PBR111 as a promising PET tracer of the PBR/TSPO for neuroinflammation imaging.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20069292/
Quantification of regional myocardial blood flow using 13N-ammonia and reoriented dynamic positron emission tomographic imaging,"W G Kuhle, G Porenta, S C Huang, D Buxton, S S Gambhir, H Hansen, M E Phelps, H R Schelbert","Background: Regional myocardial blood flow has been quantified using transaxial positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging and tracer kinetic modeling. However, the use of transaxial images limits the accuracy of regional partial volume corrections and the localization of the quantified regional flow values. The purpose of the present study was to overcome both problems by calculating regional flows from reoriented short-axis PET images.

Methods and results: Twelve experiments were performed in four dogs. 13N-ammonia was injected intravenously while microspheres were administered into the left atrium during baseline, hyperemic, and low-flow conditions. Serial transaxial frames were acquired with a 15-plane PET scanner and reoriented into short-axis frames. The arterial input function and eight regional myocardial tissue activity curves were derived from the reoriented frames. The arterial input functions were corrected for ammonia metabolites, and the myocardial tissue curves were corrected for spillover of activity, partial volume effects, and heterogeneities in the image's spatial resolution introduced during reorientation. Corrections for regional partial volume were based on estimates of the regional myocardial activity thickness derived from reoriented diastolic images of the heart. The myocardial 13N-ammonia kinetics were described with a two-pool compartmental model. Values of regional myocardial blood flow by PET correlated linearly with those by microspheres (slope, 0.94; y intercept, 0.06 ml/min/g; r = 0.93) over a wide range of flows.

Conclusions: Regional myocardial blood flow can be measured accurately and noninvasively from serially acquired and reoriented short-axis 13N-ammonia images, thus overcoming limitations inherent to the use of transaxially acquired images and permitting a more complete evaluation of regional blood flows throughout the left ventricular myocardium.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1516170/
"A biologically adapted dose-escalation approach, demonstrated for 18F-FET-PET in brain tumors","Mark Rickhey, Oliver Koelbl, Christoph Eilles, Ludwig Bogner","Purpose: To demonstrate the feasibility of a biologically adapted dose-escalation approach to brain tumors.

Material and methods: Due to the specific accumulation of fluoroethyltyrosine (FET) in brain tumors, (18)F-FET-PET imaging is used to derive a voxel-by-voxel dose distribution. Although the kinetics of (18)F-FET are not completely understood, the authors regard regions with high tracer uptake as vital and aggressive tumor and use a linear dose-escalation function between SUV (standard uptake value) 3 and SUV 5. The resulting dose distribution is then planned using the inverse Monte Carlo treatment- planning system IKO. In a theoretical study, the dose range is clinically adapted from 1.8 Gy to 2.68 Gy per fraction (with a total of 30 fractions). In a second study, the maximum dose of the model is increased step by step from 2.5 Gy to 3.4 Gy to investigate whether a significant dose escalation to tracer-accumulating subvolumes is possible without affecting the shell-shaped organ at risk (OAR). For all dose-escalation levels the dose difference Delta D of each voxel inside the target volume is calculated and the mean dose difference Delta D and their standard deviation sigma Delta D are determined. The dose to the OAR is evaluated by the dose values D OAR 50% and D OAR 5%, which are the dose values not exceeded by 50% and 5% of the volume, respectively.

Results: The inhomogeneous dose prescription is achieved with high accuracy (Delta D < 0.03 +/- 0.3 Gy/fraction). The maximum dose can be increased remarkably, without increasing the dose to the OAR (standard deviation of D OAR 50% < 0.02 Gy/fraction and of D OAR 5% < 0.05 Gy/fraction).

Conclusion: Assuming that regions with high tracer uptake can be interpreted as target for radiotherapy, (18)F-FET-PET-based ""dose painting by numbers"" applied to brain tumors is a feasible approach. The dose, and therefore potentially the chance of tumor control, can be enhanced. The proposed model can easily be transferred to other tracers and tumor entities.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19016044/
Simplified quantification of myocardial flow reserve with flurpiridaz F 18: validation with microspheres in a pig model,"Hossam M Sherif, Stephan G Nekolla, Antti Saraste, Sybille Reder, Ming Yu, Simon Robinson, Markus Schwaiger","The novel PET flow tracer flurpiridaz F 18 shows high myocardial extraction and slow washout. flurpiridaz F 18 PET data analysis with tracer kinetic modeling provides accurate absolute myocardial blood flow (MBF) measurements but requires in-scanner injection and complex processing. We evaluated the hypothesis that myocardial retention and standardized uptake values (SUVs) based on late uptake provide accurate estimates of myocardial flow reserve (MFR) and, thus, might allow simplified quantification after tracer injection outside the scanner.

Methods: Nine pigs had dynamic PET scans after repeated injections of flurpiridaz F 18 at rest and combined adenosine and dobutamine stress. flurpiridaz F 18 PET with a 3-compartment model and coinjected radioactive microspheres were used to delineate MBF. These quantitative measurements were compared with myocardial retention (%/min) and SUV of flurpiridaz F 18 after summing data over 5-10, 5-12, 5-15, 10-15, and 10-20 min after tracer injection.

Results: MBF ranged from 0.5 to 2.8 mL/min/g. There was a good correlation between both flurpiridaz F 18 retention and SUVs from 5 to 12 min after injection and MBF measured using 3-compartment model- or microsphere-derived MBF (r = 0.73, P < 0.05, and r = 0.68, P < 0.05, respectively, for retention; r = 0.88, P < 0.001, and r = 0.92, P < 0.001, respectively, for SUV). At later time points, retention and SUV underestimated stress microsphere flow (at 10-20 min: r = 0.41, P = not significant, and r = 0.46, P = not significant, respectively, for retention; r = 0.41, P = not significant, and r = 0.65, P < 0.05, respectively, for SUV). When measured 5-12 min after injection, there was a close agreement between MFR measured with either flurpiridaz F 18 retention or SUV and MFR measured using microspheres (mean difference, -0.08 ± 0.36 and -0.18 ± 0.25, respectively).

Conclusion: Myocardial retention and SUVs of the (18)F-labeled flow tracer flurpiridaz F 18 accurately reflect the MFR. These simplified analysis methods may facilitate the combination of quantitative assessment of perfusion reserve and rapid clinical imaging protocols.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21441533/
Evidence for astrocytosis in prodromal Alzheimer disease provided by 11C-deuterium-L-deprenyl: a multitracer PET paradigm combining 11C-Pittsburgh compound B and 18F-FDG,"Stephen F Carter, Michael Schöll, Ove Almkvist, Anders Wall, Henry Engler, Bengt Långström, Agneta Nordberg","Astrocytes colocalize with fibrillar amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques in postmortem Alzheimer disease (AD) brain tissue. It is therefore of great interest to develop a PET tracer for visualizing astrocytes in vivo, enabling the study of the regional distribution of both astrocytes and fibrillar Aβ. A multitracer PET investigation was conducted for patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), patients with mild AD, and healthy controls using (11)C-deuterium-L-deprenyl ((11)C-DED) to measure monoamine oxidase B located in astrocytes. Along with (11)C-DED PET, (11)C-Pittsburgh compound B ((11)C-PIB; fibrillar Aβ deposition), (18)F-FDG (glucose metabolism), T1 MRI, cerebrospinal fluid, and neuropsychologic data were acquired from the patients.

Methods: (11)C-DED PET was performed in MCI patients (n = 8; mean age ± SD, 62.6 ± 7.5 y; mean Mini Mental State Examination, 27.5 ± 2.1), AD patients (n = 7; mean age, 65.1 ± 6.3 y; mean Mini Mental State Examination, 24.4 ± 5.7), and healthy age-matched controls (n = 14; mean age, 64.7 ± 3.6 y). A modified reference Patlak model, with cerebellar gray matter as a reference, was chosen for kinetic analysis of the (11)C-DED data. (11)C-DED data from 20 to 60 min were analyzed using a digital brain atlas. Mean regional (18)F-FDG uptake and (11)C-PIB retention were calculated for each patient, with cerebellar gray matter as a reference.

Results: ANOVA analysis of the regional (11)C-DED binding data revealed a significant group effect in the bilateral frontal and bilateral parietal cortices related to increased binding in the MCI patients. All patients, except 3 with MCI, showed high (11)C-PIB retention. Increased (11)C-DED binding in most cortical and subcortical regions was observed in MCI (11)C-PIB+ patients relative to controls, MCI (11)C-PIB (negative) patients, and AD patients. No regional correlations were found between the 3 PET tracers.

Conclusion: Increased (11)C-DED binding throughout the brain of the MCI (11)C-PIB+ patients potentially suggests that astrocytosis is an early phenomenon in AD development.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22213821/
PET Imaging of Synaptic Density: Challenges and Opportunities of Synaptic Vesicle Glycoprotein 2A PET in Small Animal Imaging,"Takuya Toyonaga, Arman Fesharaki-Zadeh, Stephen M Strittmatter, Richard E Carson, Zhengxin Cai","The development of novel PET imaging agents for synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A) allowed for thein vivodetection of synaptic density changes, which are correlated with the progression and severity of a variety of neuropsychiatric diseases. While multiple ongoing clinical investigations using SV2A PET are expanding its applications rapidly, preclinical SV2A PET imaging in animal models is an integral component of the translation research and provides supporting and complementary information. Herein, we overview preclinical SV2A PET studies in animal models of neurodegenerative disorders and discuss the opportunities and practical challenges in small animal SV2A PET imaging. At the Yale PET Center, we have conducted SV2A PET imaging studies in animal models of multiple diseases and longitudinal SV2A PET allowed us to evaluate synaptic density dynamics in the brains of disease animal models and to assess pharmacological effects of novel interventions. In this article, we discuss key considerations when designing preclinical SV2A PET imaging studies and strategies for data analysis. Specifically, we compare the brain imaging characteristics of available SV2A tracers, i.e., [11C]UCB-J, [18F]SynVesT-1, [18F]SynVesT-2, and [18F]SDM-16, in rodent brains. We also discuss the limited spatial resolution of PET scanners for small brains and challenges of kinetic modeling. We then compare different injection routes and estimate the maximum throughput (i.e., number of animals) per radiotracer synthesis by taking into account the injectable volume for each injection method, injected mass, and radioactivity half-lives. In summary, this article provides a perspective for designing and analyzing SV2A PET imaging studies in small animals.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35345546/
Assessment of Tryptophan Uptake and Kinetics Using 1-(2-18F-Fluoroethyl)-l-Tryptophan and α-11C-Methyl-l-Tryptophan PET Imaging in Mice Implanted with Patient-Derived Brain Tumor Xenografts,"Sharon K Michelhaugh, Otto Muzik, Anthony R Guastella, Neil V Klinger, Lisa A Polin, Hancheng Cai, Yangchun Xin, Thomas J Mangner, Shaohui Zhang, Csaba Juhász, Sandeep Mittal","Abnormal tryptophan metabolism via the kynurenine pathway is involved in the pathophysiology of a variety of human diseases including cancers. α-11C-methyl-l-tryptophan (11C-AMT) PET imaging demonstrated increased tryptophan uptake and trapping in epileptic foci and brain tumors, but the short half-life of11C limits its widespread clinical application. Recent in vitro studies suggested that the novel radiotracer 1-(2-18F-fluoroethyl)-l-tryptophan (18F-FETrp) may be useful to assess tryptophan metabolism via the kynurenine pathway. In this study, we tested in vivo organ and tumor uptake and kinetics of18F-FETrp in patient-derived xenograft mouse models and compared them with11C-AMT uptake.

Methods: Xenograft mouse models of glioblastoma and metastatic brain tumors (from lung and breast cancer) were developed by subcutaneous implantation of patient tumor fragments. Dynamic PET scans with18F-FETrp and11C-AMT were obtained for mice bearing human brain tumors 1-7 d apart. The biodistribution and tumoral SUVs for both tracers were compared.

Results: 18F-FETrp showed prominent uptake in the pancreas and no bone uptake, whereas11C-AMT showed higher uptake in the kidneys. Both tracers showed uptake in the xenograft tumors, with a plateau of approximately 30 min after injection; however,18F-FETrp showed higher tumoral SUV than11C-AMT in all 3 tumor types tested. The radiation dosimetry for18F-FETrp determined from the mouse data compared favorably with the clinical18F-FDG PET tracer.

Conclusion: 18F-FETrp tumoral uptake, biodistribution, and radiation dosimetry data provide strong preclinical evidence that this new radiotracer warrants further studies that may lead to a broadly applicable molecular imaging tool to examine abnormal tryptophan metabolism in human tumors.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27765857/
Microglia activation in a pediatric rabbit model of tuberculous meningitis,"Elizabeth W Tucker, Supriya Pokkali, Zhi Zhang, Vincent P DeMarco, Mariah Klunk, Elizabeth S Smith, Alvaro A Ordonez, Marie-France Penet, Zaver Bhujwalla, Sanjay K Jain, Sujatha Kannan","Central nervous system (CNS) tuberculosis (TB) is the most severe form of extra-pulmonary TB and disproportionately affects young children where the developing brain has a unique host response. New Zealand white rabbits were infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis via subarachnoid inoculation at postnatal day 4-8 and evaluated until 4-6 weeks post-infection. Control and infected rabbit kits were assessed for the development of neurological deficits, bacterial burden, and postmortem microbiologic and pathologic changes. The presence of meningitis and tuberculomas was demonstrated histologically and by in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The extent of microglial activation was quantified by in vitro immunohistochemistry as well as non-invasive in vivo imaging of activated microglia/macrophages with positron emission tomography (PET). Subarachnoid infection induced characteristic leptomeningeal and perivascular inflammation and TB lesions with central necrosis, a cellular rim and numerous bacilli on pathologic examination. Meningeal and rim enhancement was visible on MRI. An intense microglial activation was noted in M. tuberculosis-infected animals in the white matter and around the TB lesions, as evidenced by a significant increase in uptake of the tracer124I-DPA-713, which is specific for activated microglia/macrophages, and confirmed by quantification of Iba-1 immunohistochemistry. Neurobehavioral analyses demonstrated signs similar to those noted in children with delayed maturation and development of neurological deficits resulting in significantly worse composite behavior scores in M. tuberculosis-infected animals. We have established a rabbit model that mimics features of TB meningitis in young children. This model could provide a platform for evaluating novel therapies, including host-directed therapies, against TB meningitis relevant to a young child's developing brain.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27935825/
Feasibility of using abbreviated scan protocols with population-based input functions for accurate kinetic modeling of [18F]-FDG datasets from a long axial FOV PET scanner,"Hasan Sari, Lars Eriksson, Clemens Mingels, Ian Alberts, Michael E Casey, Ali Afshar-Oromieh, Maurizio Conti, Paul Cumming, Kuangyu Shi, Axel Rominger","Background: Accurate kinetic modeling of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) data requires accurate knowledge of the available tracer concentration in the plasma during the scan time, known as the arterial input function (AIF). The gold standard method to derive the AIF requires collection of serial arterial blood samples, but the introduction of long axial field of view (LAFOV) PET systems enables the use of non-invasive image-derived input functions (IDIFs) from large blood pools such as the aorta without any need for bed movement. However, such protocols require a prolonged dynamic PET acquisition, which is impractical in a busy clinical setting. Population-based input functions (PBIFs) have previously shown potential in accurate Patlak analysis of [18F]-FDG datasets and can enable the use of shortened dynamic imaging protocols. Here, we exploit the high sensitivity and temporal resolution of a LAFOV PET system and explore the use of PBIF with abbreviated protocols in [18F]-FDG total body kinetic modeling.

Methods: Dynamic PET data were acquired in 24 oncological subjects for 65 min following the administration of [18F]-FDG. IDIFs were extracted from the descending thoracic aorta, and a PBIF was generated from 16 datasets. Five different scaled PBIFs (sPBIFs) were generated by scaling the PBIF with the AUC of IDIF curve tails using various portions of image data (35-65, 40-65, 45-65, 50-65, and 55-65 min post-injection). The sPBIFs were compared with the IDIFs using the AUCs and Patlak Kiestimates in tumor lesions and cerebral gray matter. Patlak plot start time (t*) was also varied to evaluate the performance of shorter acquisitions on the accuracy of Patlak Kiestimates. Patlak Kiestimates with IDIF and t* = 35 min were used as reference, and mean bias and precision (standard deviation of bias) were calculated to assess the relative performance of different sPBIFs. A comparison of parametric images generated using IDIF and sPBIFs was also performed.

Results: There was no statistically significant difference between AUCs of the IDIF and sPBIFs (Wilcoxon test: P > 0.05). Excellent agreement was shown between Patlak Kiestimates obtained using sPBIF and IDIF. Using the sPBIF55-65with the Patlak model, 20 min of PET data (i.e., 45 to 65 min post-injection) achieved < 15% precision error in Kiestimates in tumor lesions compared to the estimates with the IDIF. Parametric images reconstructed using the IDIF and sPBIFs with and without an abbreviated protocol were visually comparable. Using Patlak Kigenerated with an IDIF and 30 min of PET data as reference, Patlak Kiimages generated using sPBIF55-65with 20 min of PET data (t* = 45 min) provided excellent image quality with structural similarity index measure > 0.99 and peak signal-to-noise ratio > 55 dB.

Conclusion: We demonstrate the feasibility of performing accurate [18F]-FDG Patlak analysis using sPBIFs with only 20 min of PET data from a LAFOV PET scanner.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36192468/
"What We Observe In Vivo Is Not Always What We See In Vitro: Development and Validation of 11C-JNJ-42491293, A Novel Radioligand for mGluR2","Gil Leurquin-Sterk, Sofie Celen, Koen Van Laere, Michel Koole, Guy Bormans, Xavier Langlois, Anne Van Hecken, Paula Te Riele, Jesús Alcázar, Alfons Verbruggen, Jan de Hoon, Jose-Ignacio Andrés, Mark E Schmidt","Positive allosteric modulators (PAM) of metabotropic glutamate receptor 2 (mGluR2) are a potential therapy for anxiety, schizophrenia, and addiction. Aside from pathophysiologic imaging studies, an mGluR2 PET tracer would enable confirmation of sufficient central target engagement and assist dose selection for proof-of-concept studies of PAM compounds.11C-JNJ-42491293, a novel high-affinity radioligand (human 50% inhibitory concentration = 9.6 nM) for the PAM site of mGluR2, was evaluated as a selective mGluR2 PAM PET tracer.

Methods: In vitro and ex vivo autoradiography binding experiments in Wistar and in mGluR2 knockout and wildtype rats as well as in vivo biodistribution and brain PET imaging studies in wildtype and mGluR2 knockout rats in a primate and in humans were performed.

Results: In vitro binding studies and in vivo imaging studies in Wistar rats showed moderate brain uptake, with a distribution pattern fully consistent with the reported intracerebral distribution of mGluR2. Given these promising findings, biodistribution, dosimetry, and brain kinetic modeling of11C-JNJ-42491293 were determined in humans. Because of an unexpected high myocardial retention, additional11C-JNJ-42491293 imaging studies were performed in recently available mGluR2 knockout and wildtype rats and in a monkey using a structurally distinct mGluR2 PAM ligand with affinity for the same site, demonstrating off-target binding in vivo that could not have been anticipated from previous in vitro experiments. To date, the target of this non-mGluR2 tracer binding remains unknown.

Conclusion: On the basis of in vivo selectivity issues suggested by human distribution and demonstrated in knockout rat models,11C-JNJ-42491293 was considered unsuitable as a specific PET ligand for in vivo imaging of mGluR2. These results emphasize the importance of elaborated in vitro/in vivo comparative studies and, when available, validation with knockout animal models or structurally distinct ligands with affinity for the same site, in radiotracer development.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27469358/
Quantification of myocardial blood flow with (82)Rb: Validation with (15)O-water using time-of-flight and point-spread-function modeling,"Mary Germino, Jim Ropchan, Tim Mulnix, Kathryn Fontaine, Nabeel Nabulsi, Eric Ackah, Herman Feringa, Albert J Sinusas, Chi Liu, Richard E Carson","Background: We quantified myocardial blood flow with (82)Rb PET using parameters of the generalized Renkin-Crone model estimated from (82)Rb and (15)O-water images reconstructed with time-of-flight and point spread function modeling. Previous estimates of rubidium extraction have used older-generation scanners without time-of-flight or point spread function modeling. We validated image-derived input functions with continuously collected arterial samples.

Methods: Nine healthy subjects were scanned at rest and under pharmacological stress on the Siemens Biograph mCT with (82)Rb and (15)O-water PET, undergoing arterial blood sampling with each scan. Image-derived input functions were estimated from the left ventricle cavity and corrected with tracer-specific population-based scale factors determined from arterial data. Kinetic parametric images were generated from the dynamic PET images by fitting the one-tissue compartment model to each voxel's time activity curve. Mean myocardial blood flow was determined from each subject's (15)O-water k 2 images. The parameters of the generalized Renkin-Crone model were estimated from these water-based flows and mean myocardial (82)Rb K 1 estimates.

Results: Image-derived input functions showed improved agreement with arterial measurements after a scale correction. The Renkin-Crone model fit (a = 0.77, b = 0.39) was similar to those previously published, though b was lower.

Conclusions: We have presented parameter estimates for the generalized Renkin-Crone model of extraction for (82)Rb PET using human (82)Rb and (15)O-water PET from high-resolution images using a state-of-the-art time-of-flight-capable scanner. These results provide a state-of-the-art methodology for myocardial blood flow measurement with (82)Rb PET.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27650280/
Impact of image-based motion correction on dopamine D3/D2 receptor occupancy-comparison of groupwise and frame-by-frame registration approaches,"Jieqing Jiao, Graham E Searle, Julia A Schnabel, Roger N Gunn","Background: Image registration algorithms are frequently used to align the reconstructed brain PET frames to remove subject head motion. However, in occupancy studies, this is a challenging task where competitive binding of a drug can further reduce the available signal for registration. The purpose of this study is to evaluate two kinds of algorithms-a conventional frame-by-frame (FBF) registration and a recently introduced groupwise image registration (GIR), for motion correction of a dopamine D3/D2 receptor occupancy study.

Methods: The FBF method co-registers all the PET frames to a common reference based on normalised mutual information as the spatial similarity. The GIR method incorporates a pharmacokinetic model and conducts motion correction by maximising a likelihood function iteratively on tracer kinetics and subject motion. Data from eight healthy volunteers scanned with [11C]-(+)-PHNO pre- and post-administration of a range of doses of the D3 antagonist GSK618334 were used to compare the motion correction performance.

Results: The groupwise registration achieved improved motion correction results, both by visual inspection of the dynamic PET data and by the reduction of the variability in the outcome measures, and required no additional steps to exclude unsuccessfully realigned PET data for occupancy modelling as compared to frame-by-frame registration. Furthermore, for the groupwise method, the resultant binding potential estimates had reduced variation and bias for individual scans and improved half maximal effective concentration (EC50) estimates were obtained for the study as a whole.

Conclusions: These results indicate that the groupwise registration approach can provide improved motion correction of dynamic brain PET data as compared to frame-by-frame registration approaches for receptor occupancy studies.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26501816/
Quantification in PET,"Paul D Acton, Hongming Zhuang, Abass Alavi","Quantification provides the link between the concentrations of radioactivity measured in tissue and the underlying physiologic processes occurring in the organ. It relates the rate at which radioactivity levels in the body change over time to quantitative parameters such as absolute rate glucose metabolism, regional blood flow, or concentrations of receptors or other binding sites. Absolute measurement of physiologic parameters generally requires accurate measurement of activity concentrations in arterial blood, which provides the input function to the kinetic model. Although absolute quantification can be a difficult process, simplifications of these invasive techniques, involving reference tissues or normalization approaches (eg, SUV), have been applied with some success. Any simplified model of tracer behavior must be validated against the full model to test for bias and systematic errors.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15488557/
(18)F-FDG dynamic PET/CT in patients with multiple myeloma: patterns of tracer uptake and correlation with bone marrow plasma cell infiltration rate,"Christos Sachpekidis, Elias K Mai, Hartmut Goldschmidt, Jens Hillengass, Dirk Hose, Leyun Pan, Uwe Haberkorn, Antonia Dimitrakopoulou-Strauss","Purpose: The value of F-FDG PET in the diagnostic approach of multiple myeloma (MM) remains incompletely elicited. Little is known about the kinetics of F-FDG in the bone marrow and extramedullary sites in MM. This study aimed to evaluate quantitative data on kinetics and distribution patterns of F-FDG in MM patients with regard to pelvic bone marrow plasma cell infiltration.

Procedures: The study included 40 patients with primary MM. Dynamic PET/CT scanning of the lower lumbar spine and pelvis was performed after the administration of F-FDG. Whole-body PET/CT studies were performed. Sites of focal increased tracer uptake were considered as highly suggestive of myelomatous involvement after taking into account the patient history and CT findings. Bone marrow of the os ilium without pathologic tracer accumulation served as reference. The evaluation of dynamic PET/CT studies was based in addition to the conventional visual (qualitative) assessment, on semiquantitative (SUV) calculations, as well as on absolute quantitative estimations after application of a 2-tissue compartment model and a noncompartmental approach. F-FDG quantitative information and corresponding distribution patterns were correlated with pelvic bone marrow plasma cell infiltration.

Results: Fifty-two myelomatous lesions were detected in the pelvis. All parameters in suspected MM lesions ranged in significantly higher levels than in reference tissue (P < 0.01). Correlative analyses revealed that bone marrow plasma cell infiltration rate correlated significantly with SUVaverage, SUVmax, and the parameters K1, influx, and fractal dimension of F-FDG in reference bone marrow (P < 0.01). In addition, whole-body static PET/CT imaging demonstrated 4 patterns of tracer uptake; these are as follows: negative, focal, diffuse, and mixed (focal/diffuse) tracer uptake. Patients with a mixed pattern of radiotracer uptake had the highest mean plasma cell infiltration rate in their bone marrow, whereas those with negative PET/CT scans demonstrated the lowest bone marrow plasma cell infiltration. In total, 265 focal myeloma-indicative F-FDG-avid lesions were detected, 129 of which correlated with low-dose CT osteolytic findings. No significant correlation between the number of focal lesions detected in PET/CT and bone marrow infiltration was detected.

Conclusions: The F-FDG kinetic parameters K1, influx, and fractal dimension as well as SUVaverage from reference tissue correlated significantly with bone marrow malignant plasma cell infiltration rate. Patients with negative PET/CT demonstrated the lowest bone marrow infiltration by malignant plasma cells, whereas those with a mixed pattern of tracer uptake had the highest infiltration.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25783508/
Synthesis and evaluation of 11C-LY2795050 as a κ-opioid receptor antagonist radiotracer for PET imaging,"Ming-Qiang Zheng, Nabeel Nabulsi, Su Jin Kim, Giampaolo Tomasi, Shu-Fei Lin, Charles Mitch, Steven Quimby, Vanessa Barth, Karen Rash, John Masters, Antonio Navarro, Eric Seest, Evan D Morris, Richard E Carson, Yiyun Huang","Kappa-opioid receptors (KOR) are believed to be involved in the pathophysiology of depression, anxiety disorders, drug abuse, and alcoholism. To date, only 1 tracer, the KOR agonist (11)C-GR103545, has been reported to be able to image KOR in primates. The goal of the present study was to synthesize the selective KOR antagonist (11)C-LY2795050 and evaluate its potential as a PET tracer to image KOR in vivo.

Methods: The in vitro binding affinity of LY2795050 was measured in radioligand competition binding assays. Ex vivo experiments were conducted using microdosing of the unlabeled ligand in Sprague-Dawley rats and in wild-type and KOR knockout mice, to assess the ligand's potential as a tracer candidate. Imaging experiments with (11)C-LY2795050 in monkeys were performed on the Focus-220 scanner with arterial blood input function measurement. Binding parameters were determined with kinetic modeling analysis.

Results: LY2795050 displays full antagonist activity and high binding affinity and selectivity for KOR. Microdosing studies in rodents and ex vivo analysis of tissue concentrations with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry identified LY2795050 as an appropriate tracer candidate able to provide specific binding signals in vivo. (11)C-LY2795050 was prepared in an average yield of 12% and greater than 99% radiochemical purity. In rhesus monkeys, (11)C-LY2795050 displayed a moderate rate of peripheral metabolism, with approximately 40% of parent compound remaining at 30 min after injection. In the brain, (11)C-LY2795050 displayed fast uptake kinetics (regional activity peak times of <20 min) and an uptake pattern consistent with the distribution of KOR in primates. Pretreatment with naloxone (1 mg/kg, intravenously) resulted in a uniform distribution of radioactivity. Further, specific binding of (11)C-LY2795050 was reduced by the selective KOR antagonist LY2456302 in a dose-dependent manner.

Conclusion: (11)C-LY2795050 displayed favorable pharmacokinetic properties and binding profiles in vivo and therefore is a suitable ligand for imaging the KOR in primates. This newly developed KOR antagonist tracer has since been advanced to PET imaging of KOR in humans and constitutes the first successful KOR antagonist radiotracer.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23353688/
Optimization algorithms and weighting factors for analysis of dynamic PET studies,"Maqsood Yaqub, Ronald Boellaard, Marc A Kropholler, Adriaan A Lammertsma","Positron emission tomography (PET) pharmacokinetic analysis involves fitting of measured PET data to a PET pharmacokinetic model. The fitted parameters may, however, suffer from bias or be unrealistic, especially in the case of noisy data. There are many optimization algorithms, each having different characteristics. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate (1) the performance of different optimization algorithms and (2) the effects of using incorrect weighting factors during optimization in terms of both accuracy and reproducibility of fitted PET pharmacokinetic parameters. In this study, the performance of commonly used optimization algorithms (i.e. interior-reflective Newton methods) and a simulated annealing (SA) method was evaluated. This SA algorithm, known as basin hopping, was modified for the present application. In addition, optimization was performed using various weighting factors. Algorithms and effects of using incorrect weighting factors were studied using both simulated and clinical time-activity curves (TACs). Input data, taken from [(15)O]H(2)O, [(11)C]flumazenil and [(11)C](R)-PK11195 studies, were used to simulate time-activity curves at various variance levels (0-15% COV). Clinical evaluation was based on studies with the same three tracers. SA was able to produce accurate results without the need for selecting appropriate starting values for (kinetic) parameters, in contrast to the interior-reflective Newton method. The latter gave biased results unless it was modified to allow for a range of starting values for the different parameters. For patient studies, where large variability is expected, both SA and the extended Newton method provided accurate results. Simulations and clinical assessment showed similar results for the evaluation of different weighting models in that small to intermediate mismatches between data variance and weighting factors did not significantly affect the outcome of the fits. Large errors were observed only when the mismatch between weighting model and data variance was large. It is concluded that selection of specific optimization algorithms and weighting factors can have a large effect on the accuracy and precision of PET pharmacokinetic analysis. Apart from carefully selecting appropriate algorithms and variance models, further improvement in accuracy might be obtained by using noise reducing strategies, such as wavelet filtering, provided that these methods do not introduce significant bias.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16912378/
Dynamic imaging of striatal D2 receptors in mice using quad-HIDAC PET,"Michael Honer, Matthias Brühlmeier, John Missimer, August P Schubiger, Simon M Ametamey","The novel, dedicated small animal PET tomograph, quad-HIDAC, offers submillimeter resolution in instrumental characterization experiments. The aim of this study was to establish the tomograph's utility in a biologic application and to demonstrate the feasibility of rapid dynamic neuroreceptor imaging in mice.

Methods: We used the well-established, high-affinity dopamine D(2) receptor PET ligand (18)F-fallypride for imaging striatal D(2) receptors in NMRI mice. Dynamic PET data were acquired using the quad-HIDAC tomograph and subject to 2 different kinetic modeling approaches. The cerebellum, a brain region devoid of D(2) receptors, was chosen as a reference region for kinetic modeling.

Results: The resolution of the quad-HIDAC camera allowed clear visualization of the left and right mouse striatum with high target-to-nontarget signal ratios. The sensitivity of the tomograph permitted the generation of time-activity curves with initial time frames of 120 s. PET experiments acquiring data for 150 min demonstrated that the binding potential of (18)F-fallypride could be fitted robustly with both reference tissue models for scan durations of >or=40 min. Voxel-wise modeling resulted in parametric maps of high quality. The values for the binding potential in the striatum reached approximately 14, consistent with striatum-to-cerebellum ratios extracted from regional time-activity curves. Comparison of in vivo PET imaging results with ex vivo postmortem tissue sampling analyses indicated discrepancies in signal intensity, possibly resulting from scatter and random background in the cerebellum region of interest and leading to an overestimation of cerebellar activity concentrations and degradation of striatum-to-cerebellum ratios in PET experiments. Intraperitoneal injection of the unlabeled D(2) receptor antagonist haloperidol 30 min before intravenous injection of (18)F-fallypride blocked tracer accumulation in the striatum by >95%.

Conclusion: The quad-HIDAC camera represents a powerful tool for future dynamic neuroreceptor PET studies in mice and rats under numerous pharmacologic or pathophysiologic conditions.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15001689/
Image quality with non-standard nuclides in PET,"R Laforest, X Liu","Non-standard positron emission tomography (PET) nuclides bring with them the prospect of new chemistry leading the way to novel approaches for targeted imaging and therapy. In particular, the kinetic energy of the positron of some of these nuclides is high (as much as 4 MeV) and, thus, a highly specific PET probe can be very lethal to cancerous cells. However, the high positron energy will degrade the spatial resolution, and this degradation will be more important in high-resolution, small animal PET imaging, where most of the novel tracers are developed. This paper discusses the image quality in small animal PET imaging obtained with such nuclides. The nuclides of (60)Cu, (61)Cu and (64)Cu, (76)Br, (94)mTc, and (89)Zr will be particularly analyzed. The spatial resolution will be seen to degrade with nuclides with higher positron end-point energy, going from 1.7 mm for (18)F to 2.2 mm for (76)Br, for example. Many of these novel PET nuclides decay by the emission of cascades gamma rays that are detected in coincidence with the positron annihilation photons which create additional noise on the images. However, the use of an image reconstruction algorithm, which includes a model of the statistical nature of nuclear decay and the modeling of the tomograph response, contributes to both improve the spatial resolution and at the same time reduce the image noise.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18043539/
PET studies of the uptake of (S)- and (R)-[11C]nicotine in the human brain: difficulties in visualizing specific receptor binding in vivo,"H Nybäck, C Halldin, A Ahlin, M Curvall, L Eriksson","(S)- and (R)-[11C]nicotine were synthesized by methylation of (S)- and (R)-nornicotine using [11C]methyl iodide. Following their intravenous injection in tracer doses to smoking and nonsmoking healthy males the radioactivity in arterial blood showed a sharp peak at about 1 min followed by a plateau level for the remaining 50 min of recording. Uptake in the brain, as measured by positron emission tomography (PET), was rapid with a peak at 5 min followed by a steady decline towards the end of the measurement. The regional distribution of radioactivity followed essentially the distribution of gray matter with high uptake in the cortex, the thalamus and the basal ganglia and low uptake in the pons, cerebellum and white matter. Levels of the labelled natural enantiomer, (S)-[11C]nicotine, were higher than those of the synthetic enantiomer, (R)-[11C]nicotine, particularly in the smokers. The time-activity curves of (S)-[11C]nicotine uptake were not changed by co-administration of 1.0 mg of unlabelled nicotine with the labelled nicotine. Similarly administration of unlabelled nicotine at the peak of radioactivity, 6 min following (S)-[11C]nicotine, had no effect on the time-activity curves. Thus essential criteria for visualizing receptor binding with the PET technique could not be fulfilled. Calculation of kinetic constants using a two-compartment model gave values indicating that the brain uptake of [11C]nicotine is mainly determined by the cerebral blood flow, extraction of the tracer over the blood-brain barrier and unspecific binding. Thus 11C-labelled nicotine does not seem to be a suitable tracer for PET studies of nicotinic cholinergic receptors in the human brain.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7862909/
Preclinical PET Studies of [11C]UCB-J Binding in Minipig Brain,"Majken Borup Thomsen, Anna Christina Schacht, Aage Kristian Olsen Alstrup, Jan Jacobsen, Thea Pinholt Lillethorup, Simone Larsen Bærentzen, Ove Noer, Dariusz Orlowski, Betina Elfving, Heidi Kaastrup Müller, David J Brooks, Anne M Landau","Purpose: Loss of neuronal synapse function is associated with a number of brain disorders. The [11C]UCB-J positron emission tomography (PET) tracer allows for in vivo examination of synaptic density, as it binds to synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A) expressed in presynaptic terminals. Here, we characterise [11C]UCB-J imaging in Göttingen minipigs.

Procedures: Using PET imaging, we examined tracer specificity and compared kinetic models. We explored the use of a standard blood curve and centrum semiovale white matter as a reference region. We compared in vivo [11C]UCB-J PET imaging to in vitro autoradiography, Western blotting and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction.

Results: The uptake kinetics of [11C]UCB-J could be described using a 1-tissue compartment model and blocking of SV2A availability with levetiracetam showed dose-dependent specific binding. Population-based blood curves resulted in reliable [11C]UCB-J binding estimates, while it was not possible to use centrum semiovale white matter as a non-specific reference region. Brain [11C]UCB-J PET signals correlated well with [3H]UCB-J autoradiography and SV2A protein levels.

Conclusions: [11C]UCB-J PET is a valid in vivo marker of synaptic density in the minipig brain, with binding values close to those reported for humans. Minipig models of disease could be valuable for investigating the efficacy of putative neuroprotective agents for preserving synaptic function in future non-invasive, longitudinal studies.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32514885/
Direct comparison of [(18) F]MH.MZ and [(18) F] altanserin for 5-HT2A receptor imaging with PET,"Hanne D Hansen, Anders Ettrup, Matthias M Herth, Agnete Dyssegaard, Cecilia Ratner, Nic Gillings, Gitte M Knudsen","Imaging the cerebral serotonin 2A (5-HT2A ) receptors with positron emission tomography (PET) has been carried out in humans with [(11) C]MDL 100907 and [(18) F]altanserin. Recently, the MDL 100907 analogue [(18) F]MH.MZ was developed combining the selectivity profile of MDL 100907 and the favourable radiophysical properties of fluorine-18. Here, we present a direct comparison of [(18) F]altanserin and [(18) F]MH.MZ. 5-HT2A receptor binding in pig cortex and cerebellum was investigated by autoradiography with [(3) H]MDL 100907, [(18) F]MH.MZ, and [(18) F]altanserin. [(18) F]MH.MZ and [(18) F]altanserin were investigated in Danish Landrace pigs by brain PET scanning at baseline and after i.v. administration of blocking doses of ketanserin. Full arterial input function and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis allowed for tissue-compartment kinetic modeling of PET data. In vitro autoradiography showed high binding in cortical regions with both [(18) F]MH.MZ and [(18) F]altanserin. Significant 5-HT2A receptor binding was also found in the pig cerebellum, thus making this region unsuitable as a reference region for in vivo data analysis in this species. The cortical binding of [(18) F]MH.MZ and [(18) F]altanserin was blocked by ketanserin supporting that both radioligands bind to 5-HT2A receptors in the pig brain. In the HPLC analysis of pig plasma, [(18) F]MH.MZ displayed a fast and reproducible metabolism resulting in hydrophilic radiometabolites only whereas the metabolic profile of [(18) F]altanserin as expected showed lipophilic radiometabolites. Due to the slow kinetics of [(18) F]MH.MZ in high-binding regions in vivo, we suggest that [(18) F]MH.MZ will be an appropriate tracer for low binding regions where kinetics will be faster, whereas [(18) F]altanserin is a suitable tracer for high-binding regions.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23390031/
Hepatic microcirculation assessed by positron emission tomography of first-pass ammonia metabolism in porcine liver,"Susanne Keiding, Ole Lajord Munk, Hendrik Vilstrup, Dennis Tønner Nielsen, Klaus Roelsgaard, Ludvik Bass","Aims/background: Intrahepatic branching of the hepatic artery (HA) to liver microcirculatory units, the acini, is more heterogeneous than that of the portal vein (PV). Furthermore, part of HA blood enters the sinusoid partially downstream between the in- and outlets. We examined the effects of these vascular variations on porcine hepatic first-pass ammonia metabolism, which is characterised by high uptake and separate periportal urea and perivenous glutamine formations.

Methods: (13)NH(3) was given via the PV, HA or caval vein, followed by 22 min dynamic liver positron emission tomography (PET) recordings in six pigs. Heterogeneity of liver (13)N-metabolism was quantified by the coefficient of variation of tissue (13)N-radioactivity measured 10 min after tracer infusion. Sinusoidal zonal clearances of (13)NH(3) into (13)N-urea and (13)N-glutamine were calculated by kinetic PET modelling.

Results: Liver metabolic heterogeneity was 0.65+/-0.20 (mean+/-SD, n=6) following (13)NH(3)-infusion into HA, 0.34+/-0.17 into PV and 0.10+/-0.02 into the caval vein. Clearance of (13)NH(3) to (13)N-urea was of similar magnitude following (13)NH(3) administration into HA and PV: 0.27+/-0.11 ml/min/g (mean+/-SD) and 0.29+/-0.09 ml/min/g, respectively. Clearances of (13)NH(3) to (13)N-glutamine when (13)NH(3) was given into HA and PV were also similar: 0.47+/-0.18 and 0.50+/-0.13 ml/min/g, respectively.

Conclusions: The present measurements of the hepatic metabolism of (13)NH(3) showed metabolic heterogeneity compatible with variation of the HA supply of the acini. Second, results of PET modelling of the sinusoidal zonation metabolism of (13)NH(3) to (13)N-urea and to (13)N-glutamine did not indicate metabolically important partial downstream arterial entry into the sinusoids.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15698415/
PET studies of cerebral levodopa metabolism: a review of clinical findings and modeling approaches,"Yoshitaka Kumakura, Paul Cumming","[(18)F]Fluoro-3,4-dihydroxyphenyl-L-alanine (FDOPA) was one of the first successful tracers for molecular imaging by positron emission tomography (PET), and has proven immensely valuable for studies of Parkinson's disease. Following intravenous FDOPA injection, the decarboxylated metabolite [(18)F] fluorodopamine is formed and trapped within terminals of the nigrostriatal dopamine neurons; reduction in the simple ratio between striatum and cerebellum is indicative of nigrostriatal degeneration. However, the kinetic analysis of dynamic FDOPA-PET recordings is formidably complex due to the entry into brain of the plasma metabolite O-methyl-FDOPA and due to the eventual washout of decarboxylated metabolites. Linear graphical analysis relative to a reference tissue input function is popular and convenient for routine clinical studies in which serial arterial blood samples are unavailable. This simplified approach has facilitated longitudinal studies in large patient cohorts. Linear graphical analysis relative to the metabolite-corrected arterial FDOPA input yields a more physiological index of FDOPA utilization, the net blood-brain clearance. Using a constrained compartmental model, FDOPA-PET recordings can be used to calculate the relative activity of the enzyme DOPA decarboxylase in living brain. We have extended this approach so as to obtain an index of steady-state trapping of [( 18)F]fluorodopamine in synaptic vesicles. Although simple methods of image analysis are sufficient for the purposes of routine clinical studies, the more complex approaches have revealed hidden aspects of brain dopamine in personality, healthy aging, and in the pathophysiologies of Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19793723/
Is there an optimal scan time for 6-[F-18]fluoro-L-DOPA PET in pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas?,"Michael Hentschel, Christof Rottenburger, Carsten C Boedeker, Hartmut P H Neumann, Ingo Brink","Purpose: To define the appropriate scan time for fluorine-18-labeled dihydroxyphenylalanine (F-18 DOPA) PET in oncological imaging of pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas.

Materials and methods: F-18 DOPA PET examinations were performed in 9 patients with 7 pheochromocytomas and 4 head and neck paragangliomas using a dedicated PET scanner. The acquisition started with a dynamic single-bed scan in the tumor region over the first 60 minutes after tracer injection followed by a late time whole-body scan at approximately 130 minutes. Standard uptake values (SUVs) were calculated in tumors, surrounding background, and adjacent normal tissues of relevance. Furthermore, kinetic analysis was performed using a 2-compartment model with rate constants for uptake (K1'), release (k2'), metabolism (k3'), and reverse reaction (k4') for region of interest and pixel-wise analysis.

Results: All tumors show a marked increased F-18 DOPA uptake, which was visually detectable and distinguishable from the surrounding tissue. The SUV is significantly lower in neck paraganglioma compared with abdominal pheochromocytomas. Mean time-activity curves of F-18 DOPA in tumors show a rapid uptake of the tracer. Already 2 minutes after the injection, the activity in the tumor is beyond that of the blood pool. The average maximum value (SUVmean = 8.2) has already been reached after 20 minutes. Afterward, a very slight decrease of the tumor SUV starts, which still amounts to 80% of the maximum value after 132 minutes. Due to the continuous decrease of activity in the background tissue, the tumor-to-background ratio of SUVs shows a constant increase within the entire period of examination. The mean values of apparent kinetic constants obtained by region of interest analysis averaged over all tumors are as follows: K1' = 2.89 ± 2.56 min(-1), k2' = 2.59 ± 2.81 min(-1), k3' = 0.301 ± 0.395 min(-1), and k4' = 0.044 ± 0.043 min(-1).

Conclusions: Pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma take up F-18 DOPA very quickly. At best, the acquisition for static clinical PET imaging of paraganglioma with F-18 DOPA can start at 20 minutes postinjection for maximum uptake in tumors. Separation of tumor, background, and adjacent normal tissues is feasible due to their differences in SUV values and kinetics. The kinetic analysis demonstrates an F-18 DOPA accumulation within the tumor due to considerable differences between the rate constants of uptake and metabolism. Second, in contradiction to healthy brain, paraganglionic tumors show a reversible F-18 DOPA metabolism.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22228360/
Can nitrogen-13 ammonia kinetic modeling define myocardial viability independent of fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose?,"R S Beanlands, R deKemp, A Scheffel, C Nahmias, E S Garnett, G Coates, H L Johansen, E Fallen","Objectives: The hypothesis of this study was that evaluation of myocardial flow and metabolism using nitrogen-13 (N-13) ammonia kinetic modeling with dynamic positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging could identify regions of myocardial scar and viable myocardium as defined by fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (F-18 FDG) PET.

Background: Uptake of most perfusion tracers depends on both perfusion and metabolic retention in tissue. This characteristic has limited their ability to differentiate myocardial scar from viable tissue. The kinetic modeling of N-13 ammonia permits quantification of blood flow and separation of the metabolic component of its uptake, which may permit differentiation of scar from viable tissue.

Methods: Sixteen patients, > 3 months after myocardial infarction, underwent dynamic N-13 ammonia and F-18 FDG PET imaging. Regions of reduced and normal perfusion were defined on static N-13 ammonia images. Patients were classified into two groups (group I [ischemic viable], n = 6; group II [scar], n = 10) on the basis of percent of maximal F-18 FDG uptake in hypoperfused segments. Nitrogen-13 ammonia kinetic modeling was applied to dynamic PET data, and rate constants were determined. Flow was defined by K1; volume of distribution (VD = K1/k2) of N-13 ammonia was used as an indirect indication of metabolic retention.

Results: Fluorine-18 FDG uptake was reduced in patients with scar compared with normal patients with ischemic viable zones (ischemic viable 93 +/- 27% [mean +/- SD]; scar 37 +/- 16%, p < or = 0.01). Using N-13 ammonia kinetic modeling, flow and VD were reduced in the hypoperfused regions of patients with scar (ischemic viable flow: 0.65 +/- 0.20 ml/min per g, scar: 0.36 +/- 0.16 ml/min per g, p < or = 0.01; VD: 3.9 +/- 1.3 and 2.0 +/- 1.07 ml/g, respectively, p < or = 0.01). For detection of viable myocardium in these patients, the sensitivity and specificity were 100% and 80% for N-13 ammonia PET flow > 0.45 ml/min per g; 100% and 70% for VD > 2.0 ml/g; and 100% and 90% for both flow > 0.45 ml/min per g and VD > 2.0 ml/g, respectively. The positive and negative predictive values for the latter approach were 86% and 100%, respectively.

Conclusions: In this cohort, patients having regions with flow < or = 0.45 ml/min per g or VD < or = 2.0 ml/g had scar. Viable myocardium had both flow > 0.45 ml/min per g and VD > 2.0 ml/g. Nitrogen-13 ammonia kinetic modeling permits determination of blood flow and metabolic integrity in patients with previous myocardial infarction and can help differentiate between scar and ischemic but viable myocardium.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9060890/
EMATA: a toolbox for the automatic extraction and modeling of arterial inputs for tracer kinetic analysis in [18F]FDG brain studies,"Mattia De Francisci, Erica Silvestri, Andrea Bettinelli, Tommaso Volpi, Manu S Goyal, Andrei G Vlassenko, Diego Cecchin, Alessandra Bertoldo","Purpose: PET imaging is a pivotal tool for biomarker research aimed at personalized medicine. Leveraging the quantitative nature of PET requires knowledge of plasma radiotracer concentration. Typically, the arterial input function (AIF) is obtained through arterial cannulation, an invasive and technically demanding procedure. A less invasive alternative, especially for [18F]FDG, is the image-derived input function (IDIF), which, however, often requires correction for partial volume effect (PVE), usually performed via venous blood samples. The aim of this paper is to present EMATA: Extraction and Modeling of Arterial inputs for Tracer kinetic Analysis, an open-source MATLAB toolbox. EMATA automates IDIF extraction from [18F]FDG brain PET images and additionally includes a PVE correction procedure that does not require any blood sampling.

Methods: To assess the toolbox generalizability and present example outputs, EMATA was applied to brain [18F]FDG dynamic data of 80 subjects, extracted from two distinct datasets (40 healthy controls, 40 glioma patients). Additionally, to compare with the reference standard, quantification using both IDIF and AIF was carried out on a third open-access dataset of 18 healthy individuals.

Results: EMATA consistently performs IDIF extraction across all datasets, despite differences in scanners and acquisition protocols. Remarkably high agreement is observed when comparing Patlak's Kibetween IDIF and AIF (R2: 0.98 ± 0.02).

Conclusion: EMATA proved adaptability to different datasets characteristics and the ability to provide arterial input functions that can be used for reliable PET quantitative analysis.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39715888/
Translational imaging of the fibroblast activation protein (FAP) using the new ligand [68Ga]Ga-OncoFAP-DOTAGA,"P Backhaus, F Gierse, M C Burg, F Büther, I Asmus, P Dorten, J Cufe, W Roll, D Neri, S Cazzamalli, J Millul, J Mock, A Galbiati, A Zana, K P Schäfers, S Hermann, M Weckesser, J Tio, S Wagner, H-J Breyholz, M Schäfers","Purpose: The fibroblast activation protein (FAP) is an emerging target for molecular imaging and therapy in cancer. OncoFAP is a novel small organic ligand for FAP with very high affinity. In this translational study, we establish [68Ga]Ga-OncoFAP-DOTAGA (68Ga-OncoFAP) radiolabeling, benchmark its properties in preclinical imaging, and evaluate its application in clinical PET scanning.

Methods: 68Ga-OncoFAP was synthesized in a cassette-based fully automated labeling module. Lipophilicity, affinity, and serum stability of68Ga-OncoFAP were assessed by determining logD7.4, IC50values, and radiochemical purity.68Ga-OncoFAP tumor uptake and imaging properties were assessed in preclinical dynamic PET/MRI in murine subcutaneous tumor models. Finally, biodistribution and uptake in a variety of tumor types were analyzed in 12 patients based on individual clinical indications that received 163 ± 50 MBq68Ga-OncoFAP combined with PET/CT and PET/MRI.

Results: 68Ga-OncoFAP radiosynthesis was accomplished with high radiochemical yields. Affinity for FAP, lipophilicity, and stability of68Ga-OncoFAP measured are ideally suited for PET imaging. PET and gamma counting-based biodistribution demonstrated beneficial tracer kinetics and high uptake in murine FAP-expressing tumor models with high tumor-to-blood ratios of 8.6 ± 5.1 at 1 h and 38.1 ± 33.1 at 3 h p.i. Clinical68Ga-OncoFAP-PET/CT and PET/MRI demonstrated favorable biodistribution and kinetics with high and reliable uptake in primary cancers (SUVmax12.3 ± 2.3), lymph nodes (SUVmax9.7 ± 8.3), and distant metastases (SUVmaxup to 20.0).

Conclusion: Favorable radiochemical properties, rapid clearance from organs and soft tissues, and intense tumor uptake validate68Ga-OncoFAP as a powerful alternative to currently available FAP tracers.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34957527/
Impact of Mechanical Ventilation and Anesthesia on PET Tracer Kinetics for Combined PET/fMRI Studies in Rats,"Yan Ma, Laura Kuebler, Sabrina Haas, Andreas Maurer, Kristina Herfert","Purpose: Positron Emission Tomography (PET), a crucial tool in molecular brain imaging, has evolved into a hybrid system through integration with functional MRI (fMRI). This advancement facilitates the simultaneous recording of molecular and functional data in animal models, offering insights into neuroreceptor and neurotransmitter dynamics and their effects on brain function. While mechanical ventilation is often used in small animal fMRI to stabilize physiological blood gas levels, its effects on PET tracer kinetics remain underexplored.

Procedures: This study examines the kinetics of [11C]raclopride, a dopamine-sensitive PET tracer targeting D2/D3 receptors, under various respiratory conditions and anesthesia protocols frequently used in small animal fMRI and PET.

Results: Results indicate significant variations in tracer kinetics: increased peak levels, a shorter time to peak, and a faster tracer equilibrium in standard uptake value ratio were observed in spontaneously breathing animals versus those under mechanical ventilation. The anesthesia type also strongly influenced the tracer kinetics: α-chloralose anesthesia reduced brain uptake, whereas isoflurane led to a more rapid equilibrium.

Conclusions: These findings underscore the profound impact of mechanical ventilation and anesthesia selection on PET tracer kinetics in hybrid PET/fMRI studies. The study highlights that those protocols established for fMRI are not directly transferable to PET imaging in small animals, emphasizing the necessity for a careful investigation of the influence of anesthesia and ventilation techniques on tracer kinetics.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40369384/
Discovery and evaluation of a novel 18F-labeled vasopressin 1a receptor PET ligand with peripheral binding specificity,"Junqi Hu, Yinlong Li, Chenchen Dong, Huiyi Wei, Kai Liao, Junjie Wei, Chunyu Zhao, Ahmad Chaudhary, Jiahui Chen, Hao Xu, Ke Zhong, Steven H Liang, Lu Wang, Weijian Ye","The arginine-vasopressin (AVP) hormone plays a pivotal role in regulating various physiological processes, such as hormone secretion, cardiovascular modulation, and social behavior. Recent studies have highlighted the V1a receptor as a promising therapeutic target. In-depth insights into V1a receptor-related pathologies, attained throughin vivoimaging and quantification in both peripheral organs and the central nervous system (CNS), could significantly advance the development of effective V1a inhibitors. To address this need, we develop a novel V1a-targeted positron emission tomography (PET) ligand, [18F]V1A-2303 ([18F]8), which demonstrates favorablein vitrobinding affinity and selectivity for the V1a receptor. Specific tracer binding in peripheral tissues was also confirmed through rigorous cell uptake studies, autoradiography, biodistribution assessments. Furthermore, [18F]8was employed in PET imaging and arterial blood sampling studies in healthy rhesus monkeys to assess its brain permeability and specificity, whole-body distribution, and kinetic properties. Our research indicated [18F]8as a valuable tool for noninvasively studying V1a receptors in peripheral organs, and as a foundational element for the development of next-generation, brain-penetrant ligands specifically designed for the CNS.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39309503/
Quantification of myocardial uptake rate constants in dynamic small-animal SPECT using a cardiac phantom,"Lindsay C Johnson, Marie A Guerraty, Stephen C Moore, Scott D Metzler","Myocardial blood flow and myocardial blood flow reserve (MBFR) measurements are often used clinically to quantify coronary microvascular function. Developing imaging-based methods to measure MBFR for research in mice would be advantageous for evaluating new treatment methods for coronary microvascular disease (CMVD), yet this is more challenging in mice than in humans. This work investigates microSPECT's quantitative capabilities of cardiac imaging by utilizing a multi-part cardiac phantom and applying a known kinetic model to synthesize kinetic data from static data, allowing for assessment of kinetic modeling accuracy. The phantom was designed with four main components: two left-ventricular (LV) myocardial sections and two LV blood-pool sections, sized for end-systole (ES) and end-diastole (ED). Each section of the phantom was imaged separately while acquiring list-mode data. These static, separate-compartment data were manipulated into synthetic dynamic data using a kinetic model representing the myocardium and blood-pool activity concentrations over time and then combined into a set of dynamic image frames and reconstructed. Regions of interest were drawn on the resulting images, and kinetic parameters were estimated. This process was performed for three tracer uptake values (K1), three myocardial wall thicknesses, ten filter parameters, and 20 iterations for 25 noise ensembles. The degree of filtering and iteration number were optimized to minimize the root mean-squared error (RMSE) of K1values, with the largest number of iterations and minimal filtering yielding the lowest error. Using the optimized parameters, K1was determined with reasonable error (~3% RMSE) over all wall thicknesses and K1input values. This work demonstrates that accurate and precise measurements of K1are possible for the U-SPECT+ system used in this study, for several different uptake rates and LV dimensions. Additionally, it allows for future investigation utilizing other imaging systems, including PET studies with any radiotracer, as well as with additional phantom parts containing lesions.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30721887/
Correlation of the Ga-68-bombesin analog Ga-68-BZH3 with receptors expression in gliomas as measured by quantitative dynamic positron emission tomography (dPET) and gene arrays,"Ludwig G Strauss, Dirk Koczan, Marcel Seiz, Jochen Tuettenberg, Kirsten Schmieder, Leyun Pan, Caixia Cheng, Antonia Dimitrakopoulou-Strauss","Purpose: The kinetics of Ga-68-BZH3, a Ga-68-bombesin analog, was compared to molecular biological data obtained from gene arrays in seven patients with a recurrent glioma. The primary aim of this study was the correlation of receptor expression and tracer kinetics.

Procedures: Dynamic positron emission tomography studies were performed and the data were analyzed by a volume-of-interest technique using a two-tissue compartment model as well as a non-compartment model. Gene array data were obtained from gene array analysis of tumor tissue samples.

Results: The correlation analysis revealed a significant nonlinear correlation of r = 0.89 (p < 0.03) for k1 and BB(2) (gastrin-releasing peptide receptor). BB(1) and BB(3) were not significantly correlated with k1. vb and k3 were not significantly correlated with the expression data of the receptors on the p < 0.05 level.

Conclusions: The parameter k1 is correlated with the expression of BB(2) based on gene array data. The quantitative analysis of the Ga-68-BZH3 kinetics can be used to predict the receptor expression of BB(2) in gliomas based on k1 of the compartment analysis. However, this study is limited to the expression data on the mRNA level and further studies are needed to assess the correlation of gene expression on the protein level.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21744169/
Automated Quantitative Image-Derived Input Function for the Estimation of Cerebral Blood Flow Using Oxygen-15-Labelled Water on a Long-Axial Field-of-View PET/CT Scanner,"Thomas Lund Andersen, Flemming Littrup Andersen, Bryan Haddock, Sverre Rosenbaum, Henrik Bo Wiberg Larsson, Ian Law, Ulrich Lindberg","The accurate estimation of the tracer arterial blood concentration is crucial for reliable quantitative kinetic analysis in PET. In the current work, we demonstrate the automatic extraction of an image-derived input function (IDIF) from a CT AI-based aorta segmentation subsequently resliced to a dynamic PET series acquired on a Siemens Vision Quadra long-axial field of view scanner in 10 human subjects scanned with [15O]H2O. We demonstrate that the extracted IDIF is quantitative and in excellent agreement with a delay- and dispersion-corrected sampled arterial input function (AIF). Perfusion maps in the brain are calculated and compared from the IDIF and AIF, respectively, showed a high degree of correlation.

Untreated primary lung and breast cancers: correlation between F-18 FDG kinetic rate constants and findings of in vitro studies,"T Torizuka, K R Zasadny, B Recker, R L Wahl","Purpose: To compare kinetic modeling of 2-[fluorine-18]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (F-18 FDG) between untreated primary lung and untreated primary breast cancers by using positron emission tomographic (PET) findings and to correlate these findings with findings of in vitro studies.

Materials and methods: Nineteen patients (12 men, seven women; age range, 49-82 years) with untreated primary lung cancer and 17 women with untreated primary breast cancer (age range, 26-65 years) underwent 1-hour dynamic F-18 FDG PET. A three-compartment model was applied to F-18 FDG kinetics in tumors. The standard uptake value normalized for lean body mass (SUVlean) in tumors was measured 50-60 minutes after tracer injection. In vitro, thin-layer chromatography was performed to evaluate the intracellular phosphorylation of tritiated F-18 FDG in human lung cancer and breast cancer cell lines.

Results: At PET, lung cancer had a significantly (P < .003) higher rate constant for F-18 FDG phosphorylation (k3) and SUVlean than did breast cancer (0.164 +/- 0.150 [standard deviation] vs 0.043 +/- 0.018 and 8.25 +/- 3.28 vs 3.17 +/- 1.08, respectively). Breast cancer showed a significant correlation between k3 and SUVlean (r = .607, P < .01), although no such correlation was observed in lung cancer. In vitro studies showed phosphorylation of F-18 FDG in breast cancer cells was less complete in hyperglycemia than it was in lung cancer cells.

Conclusion: A much lower k3 appears to be a rate-limiting factor for F-18 FDG accumulation in breast cancer, while the higher k3 in lung cancer is probably not rate limiting for F-18 FDG accumulation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9609902/
Kinetic analysis of central [76Br]bromolisuride binding to dopamine D2 receptors studied by PET,"J Delforge, C Loc'h, P Hantraye, O Stulzaft, M Khalili-Varasteh, M Mazière, A Syrota, B Mazière","The in vivo kinetic analysis of dopamine D2 receptors was obtained in baboon brain using positron emission tomography (PET) and [76Br]bromolisuride [( 76Br]BLIS) as radioligand. An injection of a trace amount of [76Br]BLIS was followed 3 h later by an injection of a mixture of [76Br]BLIS and BLIS in the same syringe (coinjection experiment). A third injection performed at 6 h was either an excess of unlabeled ligand (displacement experiment) or a second coinjection. This protocol allowed us to evaluate in the striatum of each animal and after a single experiment the quantity of available receptors (B'max) and the kinetic parameters including the association and dissociation rate constants (k + 1VR and k-1, respectively, where VR is the volume of reaction). The cerebellum data were fitted using a model without specific binding. All the parameters were estimated using nonlinear mathematical models of the ligand-receptor interactions including or not including nonspecific binding. The plasma time-concentration curve was used as an input function after correction for the metabolites. An estimate of standard errors was obtained for each PET study and for each identified parameter using the covariance matrix. The average values of B'max and KdVR were 73 +/- 11 pmol/ml tissue and 1.9 +/- 0.9 pmol/ml, respectively. The nonspecific binding was identifiable in the experiment where the last injection corresponded to a second coinjection. We found that approximately 6% of the striatal binding was nonspecific after a tracer injection of [76Br]BLIS. The nonspecific binding appeared to be reversible in the striatum but irreversible in the cerebellum.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1834685/
Gaussian process models of dynamic PET for functional volume definition in radiation oncology,"Tony Shepherd, Rikard Owenius","In routine oncologic positron emission tomography (PET), dynamic information is discarded by time-averaging the signal to produce static images of the ""standardised uptake value"" (SUV). Defining functional volumes of interest (VOIs) in terms of SUV is flawed, as values are affected by confounding factors and the chosen time window, and SUV images are not sensitive to functional heterogeneity of pathological tissues. Also, SUV iso-contours are highly affected by the choice of threshold and no threshold, or other SUV-based segmentation method, is universally accepted for a given VOI type. Gaussian Process (GP) time series models describe macro-scale dynamic behavior arising from countless interacting micro-scale processes, as is the case for PET signals from heterogeneous tissue. We use GPs to model time-activity curves (TACs) from dynamic PET and to define functional volumes for PET oncology. Probabilistic methods of tissue discrimination are presented along with novel contouring methods for functional VOI segmentation. We demonstrate the value of GP models for voxel classification and VOI contouring of diseased and metastatic tissues with functional heterogeneity in prostate PET. Classification experiments reveal superior sensitivity and specificity over SUV calculation and a TAC-based method proposed in recent literature. Contouring experiments reveal differences in shape between gold-standard and GP VOIs and correlation with kinetic models shows that the novel VOIs contain extra clinically relevant information compared to SUVs alone. We conclude that the proposed models offer a principled data analysis technique that improves on SUVs for oncologic VOI definition. Continuing research will generalize GP models for different oncology tracers and imaging protocols with the ultimate goal of clinical use including treatment planning.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22498690/
Sampling requirements for dynamic cardiac PET studies using image-derived input functions,"R R Raylman, J M Caraher, G D Hutchins","The utilization of image-derived input functions is becoming common in quantitative PET studies of the heart. Consequently, imaging protocols must be designed to sample both blood and tissue concentrations adequately. Most clinical imaging protocols consist of a series of short initial scans to measure the rapid change in blood and tissue tracer concentration levels, followed by scans of gradually increasing length. The number of initial short scans must be matched to the shape of the input function. In this paper, noise-free simulation studies were performed to evaluate the effect of temporal sampling on estimates of the parameters of a two-compartment kinetic model. In addition, the consequences of varying tracer infusion length and timing were studied. The kinetic model parameters' bias decreased when infusion times were lengthened or sampling rates increased. Our results indicated that tracer infusions of 30 sec were best suited for these studies. Two currently employed clinical imaging protocols were then optimized for use with this infusion scheme. Ten initial scans with durations of 10 sec, or twenty of 5 sec length produced unbiased estimates of kinetic model parameters that describe myocardial physiology. Noisy simulations with the equivalent of one million events confirmed these results.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8441036/
Pilot Study to Diagnose Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis With Dynamic 18F-FDG PET,"Souvik Sarkar, Michael T Corwin, Kristin A Olson, Susan L Stewart, Chung-Heng Liu, Ramsey D Badawi, Guobao Wang","Objective: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are major causes of chronic liver disease characterized by steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis. Diagnosis of inflammation is limited by the need for liver biopsy. Dynamic PET with the widely used radiotracer18F-FDG provides a novel method for evaluating spatial and temporal changes in liver inflammation.

Materials and methods: Patients with NAFLD or NASH underwent dynamic FDG PET and MRI within 6 months of undergoing liver biopsy. Liver time-activity curves were extracted to estimate kinetic parameters representing various rate constants of FDG transport using tracer kinetic modeling. Liver biopsy specimens were scored on the basis of NASH Clinical Research Network criteria.

Results: This pilot study included 22 patients, 14 of whom were women. Patient age ranged from 18 to 70 years, and the mean body mass index (weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters) was 33.2 (range, 24-43.1). The K1value, which represents the rate of FDG transport from blood to hepatic tissue, was significantly correlated with inflammation (r = -0.7284; p = 0.0001) and the overall NAFLD activity score (NAS; r = -0.6750; p = 0.0006). K1values were inversely related to the hepatic inflammation score and NAS. Although heterogeneity in K1values across eight liver segments was noted, distinct segregation existed among segmental K1values dependent on the histologic inflammation score (p = 0.022) or NAS (p = 0.0091). K1had a strong association with both inflammation (ROC AUC value, 0.88) and the NAS (ROC AUC value, 0.89), with K1= 1.02 (mL/min/mL) corresponding to a sensitivity and specificity of 93% and 88%, respectively, for the NAS.

Conclusion: Dynamic FDG PET with tracer kinetic modeling has the potential to determine liver inflammation in patients with NAFLD and NASH and can fill an essential gap in diagnosis.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30673340/
Measurement of extracellular volume and transit time heterogeneity using contrast-enhanced myocardial perfusion MRI in patients after acute myocardial infarction,"Karl P Kunze, Christoph Rischpler, Carmel Hayes, Tareq Ibrahim, Karl-Ludwig Laugwitz, Axel Haase, Markus Schwaiger, Stephan G Nekolla","Purpose: To assess the ability of dynamic contrast-enhanced myocardial perfusion MRI to measure extracellular volume (ECV) and to investigate the possibility of estimating capillary transit time heterogeneity (CTH) in patients after myocardial infarction and successful revascularization.

Methods: Twenty-four perfusion data sets were acquired on a 3 Tesla positron emission tomography (PET)/MRI scanner. Three perfusion models of different complexity were implemented in a hierarchical fashion with an Akaike information criterion being used to determine the number of fit parameters supported by the data. Results were compared sector-wise to ECV from an equilibrium T1mapping method (modified look-locker inversion recovery (MOLLI)).

Results: ECV derived from the perfusion analysis correlated well with equilibrium measurements (R² = 0.76). Estimation of CTH was supported in 16% of sectors (mostly remote). Inclusion of a nonzero CTH parameter usually led to lower estimates of first-pass extraction and slightly higher estimates of blood volume and flow. Estimation of the capillary permeability-surface area product was feasible in 81% of sectors.

Conclusion: Transit time heterogeneity has a measurable effect on the kinetic analysis of myocardial perfusion MRI data, and Gd-DTPA extravasation in the myocardium is usually not flow-limited in infarct-related pathology. Measurement of myocardial ECV using perfusion imaging could provide a scan-time efficient alternative to methods based on T1mapping.

Temporal lobe epilepsy visualized with PET with 11C-L-deuterium-deprenyl--analysis of kinetic data,"M Bergström, E Kumlien, A Lilja, N Tyrefors, G Westerberg, B Långström","Objectives: The purpose of the study was to develop a simplified method for the acquisition and analysis of data from positron emission tomography (PET) using the ligand 11C-L-deuterium-deprenyl. This is motivated by an increased interest in methods to characterize gliosis in neurodegenerative diseases and epilepsy, which can be defined due to an increased expression of the enzyme MAO-B.

Methods: Seven patients with temporal lobe epilepsy were investigated with PET. The tracer kinetics in different brain structures was recorded and analyzed using different models with and without a plasma input function. The derived values were correlated to literature values of 3H-deprenyl binding in frozen sections from normal human brains.

Results: A good correlation was seen between in vivo binding and in vitro data, with the correlation being equally good irrespective of whether metabolite corrected plasma or modified cerebellar uptake values were used as input function. The epileptic lobe was, compared to non-epileptic, characterized by a lower initial distribution and an enhanced late accumulation of the tracer. With the applied method, it was possible to correctly identify the epileptic side in all 6 unilateral patients and I probable bilateral case.

Conclusions: PET with 11C-L-deuterium-deprenyl gives a good correlation between calculated in vivo binding and MAO-B activity. The analysis can be simplified and blood sampling avoided if modified cerebellar time-activity data is used as a reference. Separate images of distribution volume and MAO-B binding can be generated.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9808270/
Evaluation of (R)-[11C]verapamil as PET tracer of P-glycoprotein function in the blood-brain barrier: kinetics and metabolism in the rat,"Gert Luurtsema, Carla F M Molthoff, Robert C Schuit, Albert D Windhorst, Adriaan A Lammertsma, Eric J F Franssen","There is evidence that P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in the blood-brain barrier (BBB) may be involved in the aetiology of neurological disorders. For quantification of P-gp function in vivo, (R)-[11C]verapamil can be used as a positron emission tomography (PET) tracer, provided that a mathematical model describing kinetics of uptake and clearance of verapamil is available. To develop and validate such a model, the kinetic profile and metabolism of (R)-[11C]verapamil have to be known. The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of labeled metabolites of [11C]verapamil in the plasma and (brain) tissue of Wistar rats. For this purpose, extraction and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) methods were developed. The radioactive metabolites of (R)-[11C]verapamil in the liver were N-dealkylated compounds, O-demethylated compounds and a polar fraction formed from N-demethylation products of (R)-[11C]verapamil. Apart from this [11C] polar fraction, other radioactive metabolites of [11C]verapamil were not detected in the brain tissue. Thirty minutes after injection, unmetabolized (R)-[11C]verapamil accounted for 47% of radioactivity in the plasma and 69% in the brain. Sixty minutes after injection, unmetabolized (R)-[11C] verapamil was 27% and 48% in the plasma and the brain, respectively.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15691665/
Radiation dosimetry of florbetapir F 18,"Abhinay D Joshi, Michael J Pontecorvo, Lee Adler, Michael G Stabin, Daniel M Skovronsky, Alan P Carpenter, Mark A Mintun, Florbetapir F 18 study investigators","Background: Florbetapir is one of several 18F-labeled amyloid plaque imaging tracers for positron emission tomography (PET). As the bio-distribution and radiation dose of PET tracers in human research are important for estimating the relative risks and benefits, a study was conducted to obtain this information on florbetapir.

Methods: Nine cognitively normal subjects (six females and three males, age 58 ± 10 years, weight 81 ± 17 kg) received an intravenous bolus injection of 395 ± 27.9 MBq of florbetapir, and whole-body emission scans were performed over approximately 6 h. Computed tomography scans were acquired for attenuation correction. Volumes of interest (VOIs) for source organs including the brain, liver, lung, heart wall, and vertebrae were defined on the PET images. The VOIs of the gallbladder, urinary bladder, and large and small intestines were also defined. Using reference man organ volumes (ICRP 30), total activity was calculated per organ for each time point. The resultant time-activity curves (TACs) were fitted with constrained exponentials. Kinetic data were entered into OLINDA/EXM software to calculate dose estimates; the dynamic urinary bladder and ICRP 30 GI tract models were employed. The effective dose (ED) for each subject was estimated from the acquired data using the adult model.

Results: The mean ED determined for nine healthy volunteers was 18.60 ± 4.26 μSv/MBq or 6.88 mSv for a 370-MBq dose. The organs that received the highest radiation absorbed doses were the gallbladder, upper large intestine, small intestine, liver, and urinary bladder at 143.0 ± 80.20, 74.50 ± 34.20, 65.50 ± 29.60, 64.40 ± 22.10, and 27.10 ± 11.70 μSv/MBq, respectively.

Conclusions: The ED for florbetapir has been calculated for nine healthy volunteers. At a dose of 370 MBq florbetapir, the total average ED is approximately 6.88 mSv.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24401181/
Assessment of cardiac autonomic neuronal function using PET imaging,"James T Thackeray, Frank M Bengel","The autonomic nervous system is the primary extrinsic control of cardiac performance, and altered autonomic activity has been recognized as an important factor in the progression of various cardiac pathologies. Molecular imaging techniques have been developed for global and regional interrogation of pre- and postsynaptic targets of the cardiac autonomic nervous system. Building on established work with the guanethidine analogue ¹²³I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) for single-photon emission tomography (SPECT), development of radiotracers and protocols for positron emission tomography (PET) investigation of autonomic signaling has expanded. PET is limited in availability and requires specialized centers for radiosynthesis and interpretation, but the higher resolution allows for improved regional analysis and kinetic modeling provides more true quantification than is possible with SPECT. A wider array of radiolabeled catecholamines, analogues of catecholamines, and receptor ligands have been characterized and evaluated. Sympathetic neuronal PET tracers have shown promise in the identification of several cardiac pathologies. In particular, recent studies have elucidated a mechanistic role for heterogeneous sympathetic innervation in the development of lethal ventricular arrhythmias. Evaluation of cardiomyocyte adrenergic receptor expression and the parasympathetic nervous system has been slower to develop, with clinical studies beginning to emerge. This review summarizes the clinical and the experimental PET tracers currently available for autonomic imaging and discusses their application in health and cardiovascular disease, with particular emphasis on the major findings of the last decade.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23179458/
The total amount of uptake may affect the input function: a theoretic approach about 18F-FDG PET imaging,"Eric Laffon, Roger Marthan","Introduction: The aim of this theoretic approach is to establish an analytical relationship between the total amount of uptake (TAU), either pathological or physiological, and the time constants ""αi"" that describe the time decay of the tracer input function (IF). The proposed approach uses parameters of a (population-based) arterial plasma IF for 18 F-FDG PET imaging.

Methods: A previously published formula provides an estimate of the ratio ""p"" of 18 F-FDG molecules that are irreversibly trapped in an 18 F-FDG-positive tissue during a whole PET examination, to the number of injected molecules. Then, the change in the magnitude of the IF time constants is derived, involving a corrective procedure.

Results: Trapping of injected tracer molecules affects each αi that is increased by a factor of 1/(1-p), with p ranging between zero and, theoretically, less than 1. This result is illustrated in a patient showing an intense uptake in the mediastinum at initial staging of a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).

Conclusions: An analytical relationship between TAU and the IF time constants is available in 18 F-FDG PET imaging, showing that TAU may actually affect the IF.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25960434/

We used this approach in five18F-FDG PET/MRI brain studies in which the input function was also acquired using the gold standard of serial arterial blood sampling. After accounting for partial volume, dispersion, and calibration effects, we compared the metabolic rates of glucose (MRglu) quantified from VersaPET IDIFs in 80 brain regions to those using the gold standard and achieved a bias and variability of <5% which is within the range of reported test-retest values for this type of study. We also achieved a strong linear relationship (R2>0.97) against the gold standard across regions. The results of this preliminary study are promising and support further studies to optimize methods, validate in a larger cohort, and extend to the modeling of other radiotracers.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36212108/
The influence of tomograph sensitivity on kinetic parameter estimation in positron emission tomography imaging studies of the rat brain,"S R Meikle, S Eberl, R R Fulton, M Kassiou, M J Fulham",We investigated the influence of tomograph sensitivity on reliability of parameter estimation in positron emission tomography studies of the rat brain. The kinetics of two tracers in rat striatum and cerebellum were simulated. A typical injected dose of 10 MBq and a reduced dose of 1 MBq were assumed. Kinetic parameters were estimated using a region of interest (ROI) analysis and two pixel-by-pixel analyses. Striatal binding potential was estimated as a function of effective tomograph sensitivity (S(eff)) using a simplified reference tissue model. A S(eff) value of > or =1% was required to ensure reliable parameter estimation for ROI analysis and a S(eff) of 3-6% was required for pixel-by-pixel analysis. We conclude that effective tomograph sensitivity of 3% may be an appropriate design goal for rat brain imaging.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11056379/
"Synthesis, in vitro and in vivo evaluation of 11C-O-methylated arylpiperazines as potential serotonin 1A (5-HT1A) receptor antagonist radiotracers","Vidya Narayanaswami, Junchao Tong, Ferdinando Fiorino, Beatrice Severino, Rosa Sparaco, Elisa Magli, Flavia Giordano, Peter M Bloomfield, Jaya Prabhakaran, J John Mann, Neil Vasdev, Kenneth Dahl, J S Dileep Kumar","Background: Serotonin 1A (5-HT1A) receptors are implicated in the pathogenesis of several psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders motivating the development of suitable radiotracers for in vivo positron emission tomography (PET) neuroimaging. The gold standard PET imaging agent for this target is [carbonyl-11C]WAY-100635, labeled via a technically challenging multi-step reaction that has limited its widespread use. While several antagonist and agonist-based PET radiotracers for 5-HT1Areceptors have been developed, their clinical translation has been hindered by methodological challenges and/or and non-specific binding. As a result, there is continued interest in the development of new and more selective 5-HT1APET tracers having a relatively easier and reliable radiosynthesis process for routine production and with favorable metabolism to facilitate tracer-kinetic modeling. The purpose of the current study was to develop and characterize a radioligand with suitable characteristics for imaging 5-HT1Areceptors in the brain. The current study reports the in vitro characterization and radiosyntheses of three candidate 5-HT1Areceptor antagonists, DF-100 (1), DF-300 (2) and DF-400 (3), to explore their suitability as potential PET radiotracers.

Results: Syntheses of 1-3 and corresponding precursors for radiolabeling were achieved from isonicotinic, picolinic acid or picolino nitrile. In vitro binding studies demonstrated nanomolar affinity of the compounds for 5-HT1Areceptors. Binding of 1-3 for other biogenic amines, neurotransmitter receptors, and transporters was negligible with the exception of moderate affinities for α1-adrenergic receptors (4-6-fold less potent than that for 5-HT1Areceptor). Radioligands [11C]1-3 were efficiently prepared by11C-O-methylation of the corresponding phenolic precursor in non-decay corrected radiochemical yields of 7-11% with > 99% chemical and radiochemical purities. Dynamic PET studies in rats demonstrated negligible brain uptake of [11C]1 and [11C]2. In contrast, significant brain uptake of [11C]3 was observed with an early peak SUV of 4-5. However, [11C]3 displayed significant off-target binding attributed to α1-adrenergic receptors based on regional distribution (thalamus>hippocampus) and blocking studies.

Conclusion: Despite efficient radiolabeling, results from PET imaging experiments limit the application of [11C]3 for in vivo quantification of 5-HT1Areceptors. Nevertheless, derivatives of compound 3 may provide a scaffold for alternative PET radiotracers with improved selectivity for 5-HT1Areceptors or α1-adrenergic receptors.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32430632/
Kinetic modeling of PET-FDG in the brain without blood sampling,M'hamed Bentourkia,"The aim in this work is to report a new method to calculate parametric images from a single scan acquisition with positron emission tomography (PET) and fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) in the human brain without blood sampling. It is usually practical for research or clinical purposes to inject the patient in an isolated room and to start the PET acquisition only for some 10-20 min, about 30 min after FDG injection. In order to calculate the cerebral metabolic rates for glucose (CMRG), usually several blood samples are required. The proposed method considers the relation between the uptake of the tracer in the cerebellum as a reference tissue and the population based input curve. Similar results were obtained for CMRG values with the present method in comparison to the usual autoradiographic and the non-linear least squares fitting of regions of interest.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16978837/

Here we demonstrate the ability of total-body multiparametric18F-FDG PET to quantitatively evaluate glucose metabolism using macroparametric quantification and assess specific glucose delivery and phosphorylation processes using microparametric quantification for studying recovery from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).Methods:The study included 13 healthy subjects and 12 recovering COVID-19 subjects within 8 wk of confirmed diagnosis. Each subject had a 1-h dynamic18F-FDG scan on the uEXPLORER total-body PET/CT system. Semiquantitative SUV and the SUV ratio relative to blood (SUVR) were calculated for different organs to measure glucose utilization. Tracer kinetic modeling was performed to quantify the microparametric blood-to-tissue18F-FDG delivery rate [Formula: see text] and the phosphorylation ratek3, as well as the macroparametric18F-FDG net influx rate ([Formula: see text]). Statistical tests were performed to examine differences between healthy subjects and recovering COVID-19 subjects. The effect of COVID-19 vaccination was also investigated.Results:We detected no significant difference in lung SUV but significantly higher lung SUVR and [Formula: see text] in COVID-19 recovery, indicating improved sensitivity of kinetic quantification for detecting the difference in glucose metabolism. A significant difference was also observed in the lungs with the phosphorylation ratek3but not with [Formula: see text], which suggests that glucose phosphorylation, rather than glucose delivery, drives the observed difference of glucose metabolism. Meanwhile, there was no or little difference in bone marrow18F-FDG metabolism measured with SUV, SUVR, and [Formula: see text] but a significantly higher bone marrow [Formula: see text] in the COVID-19 group, suggesting a difference in glucose delivery. Vaccinated COVID-19 subjects had a lower lung [Formula: see text] and a higher spleen [Formula: see text] than unvaccinated COVID-19 subjects.Conclusion:Higher lung glucose metabolism and bone marrow glucose delivery were observed with total-body multiparametric18F-FDG PET in recovering COVID-19 subjects than in healthy subjects, implying continued inflammation during recovery. Vaccination demonstrated potential protection effects. Total-body multiparametric PET of18F-FDG can provide a more sensitive tool and more insights than conventional whole-body static18F-FDG imaging to evaluate metabolic changes in systemic diseases such as COVID-19.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37591539/
(11)C-MK-8278 PET as a tool for pharmacodynamic brain occupancy of histamine 3 receptor inverse agonists,"Koenraad J Van Laere, Sandra M Sanabria-Bohórquez, David P Mozley, Donald H Burns, Terence G Hamill, Anne Van Hecken, Inge De Lepeleire, Michel Koole, Guy Bormans, Jan de Hoon, Marleen Depré, Kristine Cerchio, John Plalcza, Lingling Han, John Renger, Richard J Hargreaves, Robert Iannone","The histamine 3 (H3) receptor is a presynaptic autoreceptor in the central nervous system that regulates the synthesis and release of histamine and modulates the release of other major neurotransmitters. H3 receptor inverse agonists (IAs) may be efficacious in the treatment of various central nervous system disorders, including excessive daytime sleepiness, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, Alzheimer disease, ethanol addiction, and obesity.

Methods: Using PET and a novel high-affinity and selective radioligand (11)C-MK-8278, we studied the tracer biodistribution, quantification, and brain H3 receptor occupancy (RO) of MK-0249 and MK-3134, 2 potential IA drugs targeting cerebral H3 receptors, in 6 healthy male subjects (age, 19-40 y). The relationship among H3 IA dose, time on target, and peripheral pharmacokinetics was further investigated in 15 healthy male volunteers (age, 18-40 y) with up to 3 PET scans and 3 subjects per dose level.

Results: The mean effective dose for (11)C-MK-8278 was 5.4 ± 1.1 μSv/MBq. Human brain kinetics showed rapid high uptake and fast washout. Binding potential values can be assessed using the pons as a reference region, with a test-retest repeatability of 7%. Drug RO data showed low interindividual variability per dose (mean RO SD, 2.1%), and a targeted 90% RO can be reached for both IAs at clinically feasible doses.

Conclusion: (11)C-MK-8278 is a useful novel PET radioligand for determination of human cerebral H3 receptor binding and allows highly reproducible in vivo brain occupancy of H3-targeting drugs, hereby enabling the evaluation of novel compounds in early development to select doses and schedules.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24263088/
Novel spatial analysis method for PET images using 3D moment invariants: applications to Parkinson's disease,"Marjorie E Gonzalez, Katherine Dinelle, Nasim Vafai, Nicole Heffernan, Jess McKenzie, Silke Appel-Cresswell, Martin J McKeown, A Jon Stoessl, Vesna Sossi","We present a novel analysis method for positron emission tomography (PET) data that uses the spatial characteristics of the radiotracer's distribution within anatomically-defined regions of interest (ROIs) to provide an independent feature that may aid in characterizing pathological and normal states. The analysis of PET data for research purposes traditionally involves kinetic modeling of the concentration of the radiotracer over time within a ROI to derive parameters related to the uptake/binding of the radiotracer in the body. Here we describe an analysis method to quantify the spatial changes present in PET images based on 3D shape descriptors that are invariant to translation, scaling, and rotation, called 3D moment invariants (3DMIs). An ROI can therefore be characterized not only by the radiotracer's uptake rate constant or binding potential within the ROI, but also the 3D spatial shape and distribution of the radioactivity throughout the ROI. This is particularly relevant in Parkinson's disease (PD), where both the kinetic and the spatial distribution of the tracer are known to change due to disease: the posterior parts of the striatum (in particular in the putamen) are affected before the anterior parts. Here we show that 3DMIs are able to quantify the spatial distribution of PET radiotracer images allowing for discrimination between healthy controls and PD subjects. More importantly, 3DMIs are found to be well correlated with subjects' scores on the United Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (a clinical measure of disease severity) in all anatomical regions studied here (putamen, caudate and ventral striatum). On the other hand, kinetic parameters only show significant correlation to clinically-assessed PD severity in the putamen. We also find that 3DMI-characterized changes in spatial patterns of dopamine release in response to l-dopa medication are significantly correlated with PD severity. These findings suggest that quantitative studies of a radiotracer's spatial distribution may provide complementary information to kinetic modeling that is relatively robust to intersubject variability and may contribute novel information in PET neuroimaging studies.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23246861/
Validation of nitrogen-13-ammonia tracer kinetic model for quantification of myocardial blood flow using PET,"O Muzik, R S Beanlands, G D Hutchins, T J Mangner, N Nguyen, M Schwaiger","Positron emission tomography has been shown to provide quantitative estimates of myocardial blood flow using 13N-ammonia and 15O-water.

The radiopharmaceuticals 13N-ammonia and 15O-water were intravenously administered and measurements were carried out at rest and following pharmacological vasodilation to assess blood flow over a range from 53 to 580 ml/100 g/min. Quantification of blood flow based on tracer kinetic modeling of 13N-ammonia data correlated closely with myocardial blood flow determined by microspheres (y = 0.944 x +7.22, r = 0.986) and with the 15O-water injection technique y = 1.054 x -15.8 (r = 0.99).

Quantification of [18F]afatinib using PET/CT in NSCLC patients: a feasibility study,"E A van de Stadt, M Yaqub, A A Lammertsma, A J Poot, P R Schober, R C Schuit, E F Smit, I Bahce, N H Hendrikse","Introduction: Only a subgroup of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients benefit from treatment using epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) such as afatinib. Tumour uptake of [18F]afatinib using positron emission tomography (PET) may identify those patients that respond to afatinib therapy. Therefore, the aim of this study was to find the optimal tracer kinetic model for quantification of [18F]afatinib uptake in NSCLC tumours.

Methods: [18F]Afatinib PET scans were performed in 10 NSCLC patients. The first patient was scanned for the purpose of dosimetry. Subsequent patients underwent a 20-min dynamic [15O]H2O PET scan (370 MBq) followed by a dynamic [18F]afatinib PET scan (342 ± 24 MBq) of 60 or 90 min. Using the Akaike information criterion (AIC), three pharmacokinetic plasma input models were evaluated with both metabolite-corrected sampler-based input and image-derived (IDIF) input functions in combination with discrete blood samples. Correlation analysis of arterial on-line sampling versus IDIF was performed. In addition, perfusion dependency and simplified measures were assessed.

Results: Ten patients were included. The injected activity of [18F]afatinib was 341 ± 37 MBq. Fifteen tumours could be identified in the field of view of the scanner. Based on AIC, tumour kinetics were best described using an irreversible two-tissue compartment model and a metabolite-corrected sampler-based input function (Akaike 50%). Correlation of plasma-based input functions with metabolite-corrected IDIF was very strong (r2= 0.93). The preferred simplified uptake parameter was the tumour-to-blood ratio over the 60- to 90-min time interval (TBR60-90). Tumour uptake of [18F]afatinib was independent of perfusion.

Conclusion: The preferred pharmacokinetic model for quantifying [18F]afatinib uptake in NSCLC tumours was the 2T3K_vb model. TBR60-90showed excellent correlation with this model and is the best candidate simplified method.

Improved precision of SPECT myocardial blood flow using a net tracer retention model,"Sarah G Cuddy-Walsh, Robert A deKemp, Terrence D Ruddy, R Glenn Wells","Background: Noninvasive quantification of absolute myocardial blood flow (MBF) and myocardial flow reserve (MFR) provides incremental benefit to relative myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) to diagnose and manage heart disease. MBF can be measured with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) but the uncertainty in the measured values is high. Standardization and optimization of protocols for SPECT MBF measurements will improve the consistency of this technique. One element of the processing protocol is the choice of kinetic model used to analyze the dynamic image series.

Purpose: This study evaluates if a net tracer retention model (RET) will provide a better fit to the acquired data and greater test-retest precision than a one-compartment model (1CM) for SPECT MBF, with (+MC) and without (-MC) manual motion correction.

Methods: Data from previously acquired rest-stress MBF studies (31 SPECT-PET and 30 SPECT-SPECT) were reprocessed ± MC. Rate constants (K1) were extracted using 1CM and RET, +/-MC, and compared pairwise with standard PET MBF measurements using cross-validation to obtain calibration parameters for converting SPECT rate constants to MBF and to assess the goodness-of-fit of the calibration curves. Precision (coefficient of variation of test re-test relative differences, COV) of flow measurements was computed for 1CM and RET ± MC using data from the repeated SPECT MBF studies.

Results: Both the RET model and MC improved the goodness-of-fit of the SPECT MBF calibration curves to PET. All models produced minimal bias compared with PET (mean bias < 0.6%). The SPECT-SPECT MBF COV significantly improved from 34% (1CM+MC) to 28% (RET+MC, P = 0.008).

Conclusion: The RET+MC model provides a better calibration of SPECT to PET and blood flow measurements with better precision than the 1CM, without loss of accuracy.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36565461/
"MITK-ModelFit: A generic open-source framework for model fits and their exploration in medical imaging - design, implementation and application on the example of DCE-MRI","Charlotte Debus, Ralf Floca, Michael Ingrisch, Ina Kompan, Klaus Maier-Hein, Amir Abdollahi, Marco Nolden","Background: Many medical imaging techniques utilize fitting approaches for quantitative parameter estimation and analysis. Common examples are pharmacokinetic modeling in dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)/computed tomography (CT), apparent diffusion coefficient calculations and intravoxel incoherent motion modeling in diffusion-weighted MRI and Z-spectra analysis in chemical exchange saturation transfer MRI. Most available software tools are limited to a special purpose and do not allow for own developments and extensions. Furthermore, they are mostly designed as stand-alone solutions using external frameworks and thus cannot be easily incorporated natively in the analysis workflow.

Results: We present a framework for medical image fitting tasks that is included in the Medical Imaging Interaction Toolkit MITK, following a rigorous open-source, well-integrated and operating system independent policy. Software engineering-wise, the local models, the fitting infrastructure and the results representation are abstracted and thus can be easily adapted to any model fitting task on image data, independent of image modality or model. Several ready-to-use libraries for model fitting and use-cases, including fit evaluation and visualization, were implemented. Their embedding into MITK allows for easy data loading, pre- and post-processing and thus a natural inclusion of model fitting into an overarching workflow. As an example, we present a comprehensive set of plug-ins for the analysis of DCE MRI data, which we validated on existing and novel digital phantoms, yielding competitive deviations between fit and ground truth.

Conclusions: Providing a very flexible environment, our software mainly addresses developers of medical imaging software that includes model fitting algorithms and tools. Additionally, the framework is of high interest to users in the domain of perfusion MRI, as it offers feature-rich, freely available, validated tools to perform pharmacokinetic analysis on DCE MRI data, with both interactive and automatized batch processing workflows.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30651067/
Direct reconstruction of parametric images for brain PET with event-by-event motion correction: evaluation in two tracers across count levels,"Mary Germino, Jean-Dominque Gallezot, Jianhua Yan, Richard E Carson","Parametric images for dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) are typically generated by an indirect method, i.e. reconstructing a time series of emission images, then fitting a kinetic model to each voxel time activity curve. Alternatively, 'direct reconstruction', incorporates the kinetic model into the reconstruction algorithm itself, directly producing parametric images from projection data. Direct reconstruction has been shown to achieve parametric images with lower standard error than the indirect method. Here, we present direct reconstruction for brain PET using event-by-event motion correction of list-mode data, applied to two tracers. Event-by-event motion correction was implemented for direct reconstruction in the Parametric Motion-compensation OSEM List-mode Algorithm for Resolution-recovery reconstruction. The direct implementation was tested on simulated and human datasets with tracers [11C]AFM (serotonin transporter) and [11C]UCB-J (synaptic density), which follow the 1-tissue compartment model. Rigid head motion was tracked with the Vicra system. Parametric images of K1and distribution volume (VT= K1/k2) were compared to those generated by the indirect method by regional coefficient of variation (CoV). Performance across count levels was assessed using sub-sampled datasets. For simulated and real datasets at high counts, the two methods estimated K1and VTwith comparable accuracy. At lower count levels, the direct method was substantially more robust to outliers than the indirect method. Compared to the indirect method, direct reconstruction reduced regional K1CoV by 35-48% (simulated dataset), 39-43% ([11C]AFM dataset) and 30-36% ([11C]UCB-J dataset) across count levels (averaged over regions at matched iteration); VTCoV was reduced by 51-58%, 54-60% and 30-46%, respectively. Motion correction played an important role in the dataset with larger motion: correction increased regional VTby 51% on average in the [11C]UCB-J dataset. Direct reconstruction of dynamic brain PET with event-by-event motion correction is achievable and dramatically more robust to noise in VTimages than the indirect method.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28504644/

In recent years, the potential usefulness of PET has also gained attention in the field of MS. In fact, MS is a complex disease and several processes can be selected as a target for PET imaging. The use of PET with several different tracers has been mainly evaluated in the research setting to investigate disease pathophysiology (i.e. phenotypes, monitoring of progression) or to explore its use a surrogate end-point in clinical trials.

Results: We have reviewed PET imaging studies in MS in humans and animal models. Tracers have been grouped according to their pathophysiological targets (ie. tracers for myelin kinetic, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration). The emerging clinical indication for brain PET imaging in the differential diagnosis of suspected tumefactive demyelinated plaques as well as the clinical potential provided by PET images in view of the recent introduction of PET/MR technology are also addressed.

"Radioactive oxygen-15 in the study of cerebral blood flow, blood volume, and oxygen metabolism","M M Ter-Pogossian, P Herscovitch","The short half-life of 15O led early observers to believe that it was unsuitable for use as a biological tracer. However, initial studies with this nuclide demonstrated its potential usefulness for in vivo, regional physiologic measurements. Subsequently, techniques were developed to measure cerebral blood flow (CBF), blood volume, and oxygen metabolism using intracarotid injection of 15O-labeled radiopharmaceuticals and highly collimated scintillation probes to record the time course of radioactivity in the brain. The development of positron emission tomography (PET) made possible the in vivo, noninvasive measurement of the absolute concentration of positron-emitting nuclides. A variety of tracer kinetic models were formulated to obtain physiologic measurements from tomographic images of the distribution of 15O-labeled radiopharmaceuticals in the brain. 15O-labeled carbon monoxide, administered by inhalation, binds to hemoglobin in RBCs, and therefore can be used as a intravascular tracer to measure regional cerebral blood volume (rCBV). Several strategies have been developed to measure regional CBF using 15O-labeled water as an inert, diffusible flow tracer. Regional cerebral oxygen metabolism is measured using scan data obtained following the inhalation of 15O-labeled oxygen; independent determinations of local blood flow and blood volume are also required for this measurement. The tracer kinetic models used to measure rCBV, blood flow, and oxygen metabolism will be described and their relative advantages and limitations discussed. Several examples of the use of 15O tracer methods will be reviewed to demonstrate their widespread applicability to the study of cerebral physiology and pathophysiology.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3904006/
Repeatable noninvasive measurement of mouse myocardial glucose uptake with 18F-FDG: evaluation of tracer kinetics in a type 1 diabetes model,"Stephanie L Thorn, Robert A deKemp, Tyler Dumouchel, Ran Klein, Jennifer M Renaud, R Glenn Wells, Michael H Gollob, Rob S Beanlands, Jean N DaSilva","A noninvasive and repeatable method for assessing mouse myocardial glucose uptake with (18)F-FDG PET and Patlak kinetic analysis was systematically assessed using the vena cava image-derived blood input function (IDIF).

Methods: Contrast CT and computer modeling was used to determine the vena cava recovery coefficient. Vena cava IDIF (n = 7) was compared with the left ventricular cavity IDIF, with blood and liver activity measured ex vivo at 60 min. The test-retest repeatability (n = 9) of Patlak influx constant K(i) at 10-40 min was assessed quantitatively using Bland-Altman analysis. Myocardial glucose uptake rates (rMGU) using the vena cava IDIF were calculated at baseline (n = 8), after induction of type 1 diabetes (streptozotocin [50 mg/kg] intraperitoneally, 5 d), and after acute insulin stimulation (0.08 mU/kg of body weight intraperitoneally). These changes were analyzed with a standardized uptake value calculation at 20 and 40 min after injection to correlate to the Patlak time interval.

Results: The proximal mouse vena cava diameter was 2.54 ± 0.30 mm. The estimated recovery coefficient, calculated using nonlinear image reconstruction, decreased from 0.76 initially (time 0 to peak activity) to 0.61 for the duration of the scan. There was a 17% difference in the image-derived vena cava blood activity at 60 min, compared with the ex vivo blood activity measured in the γ-counter. The coefficient of variability for Patlak K(i) values between mice was found to be 23% with the proposed method, compared with 51% when using the left ventricular cavity IDIF (P < 0.05). No significant bias in K(i) was found between repeated scans with a coefficient of repeatability of 0.16 mL/min/g. Calculated rMGU values were reduced by 60% in type 1 diabetic mice from baseline scans (P < 0.03, ANOVA), with a subsequent increase of 40% to a level not significantly different from baseline after acute insulin treatment. These results were confirmed with a standardized uptake value measured at 20 and 40 min.

Conclusion: The mouse vena cava IDIF provides repeatable assessment of the blood time-activity curve for Patlak kinetic modeling of rMGU. An expected significant reduction in myocardial glucose uptake was demonstrated in a type 1 diabetic mouse model, with significant recovery after acute insulin treatment, using a mouse vena cava IDIF approach.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23940301/
"Dynamic whole-body PET parametric imaging: I. Concept, acquisition protocol optimization and clinical application","Nicolas A Karakatsanis, Martin A Lodge, Abdel K Tahari, Y Zhou, Richard L Wahl, Arman Rahmim","Static whole-body PET/CT, employing the standardized uptake value (SUV), is considered the standard clinical approach to diagnosis and treatment response monitoring for a wide range of oncologic malignancies. Alternative PET protocols involving dynamic acquisition of temporal images have been implemented in the research setting, allowing quantification of tracer dynamics, an important capability for tumor characterization and treatment response monitoring. Nonetheless, dynamic protocols have been confined to single-bed-coverage limiting the axial field-of-view to ~15-20 cm, and have not been translated to the routine clinical context of whole-body PET imaging for the inspection of disseminated disease. Here, we pursue a transition to dynamic whole-body PET parametric imaging, by presenting, within a unified framework, clinically feasible multi-bed dynamic PET acquisition protocols and parametric imaging methods. We investigate solutions to address the challenges of: (i) long acquisitions, (ii) small number of dynamic frames per bed, and (iii) non-invasive quantification of kinetics in the plasma. In the present study, a novel dynamic (4D) whole-body PET acquisition protocol of ~45 min total length is presented, composed of (i) an initial 6 min dynamic PET scan (24 frames) over the heart, followed by (ii) a sequence of multi-pass multi-bed PET scans (six passes × seven bed positions, each scanned for 45 s). Standard Patlak linear graphical analysis modeling was employed, coupled with image-derived plasma input function measurements. Ordinary least squares Patlak estimation was used as the baseline regression method to quantify the physiological parameters of tracer uptake rate Ki and total blood distribution volume V on an individual voxel basis. Extensive Monte Carlo simulation studies, using a wide set of published kinetic FDG parameters and GATE and XCAT platforms, were conducted to optimize the acquisition protocol from a range of ten different clinically acceptable sampling schedules examined. The framework was also applied to six FDG PET patient studies, demonstrating clinical feasibility. Both simulated and clinical results indicated enhanced contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs) for Ki images in tumor regions with notable background FDG concentration, such as the liver, where SUV performed relatively poorly. Overall, the proposed framework enables enhanced quantification of physiological parameters across the whole body. In addition, the total acquisition length can be reduced from 45 to ~35 min and still achieve improved or equivalent CNR compared to SUV, provided the true Ki contrast is sufficiently high. In the follow-up companion paper, a set of advanced linear regression schemes is presented to particularly address the presence of noise, and attempt to achieve a better trade-off between the mean-squared error and the CNR metrics, resulting in enhanced task-based imaging.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24080962/
Synthesis of Patient-Specific Transmission Data for PET Attenuation Correction for PET/MRI Neuroimaging Using a Convolutional Neural Network,"Karl D Spuhler, John Gardus 3rd, Yi Gao, Christine DeLorenzo, Ramin Parsey, Chuan Huang","Attenuation correction is a notable challenge associated with simultaneous PET/MRI, particularly in neuroimaging, where sharp boundaries between air and bone volumes exist. This challenge leads to concerns about the visual and, more specifically, quantitative accuracy of PET reconstructions for data obtained with PET/MRI. Recently developed techniques can synthesize attenuation maps using only MRI data and are likely adequate for clinical use; however, little work has been conducted to assess their suitability for the dynamic PET studies frequently used in research to derive physiologic information such as the binding potential of neuroreceptors in a region. At the same time, existing PET/MRI attenuation correction methods are predicated on synthesizing CT data, which is not ideal, as CT data are acquired with much lower-energy photons than PET data and thus do not optimally reflect the PET attenuation map.Methods:We trained a convolutional neural network to generate patient-specific transmission data from T1-weighted MRI. Using the trained network, we generated transmission data for a testing set comprising 11 subjects scanned with11C-labeledN-[2-]4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-N-(2-pyridinyl)cyclohexanecarboxamide) (11C-WAY-100635) and 10 subjects scanned with11C-labeled 3-amino-4-(2-dimethylaminomethyl-phenylsulfanyl)benzonitrile (11C-DASB). We assessed both static and dynamic reconstructions. For dynamic PET data, we report differences in both the nondisplaceable and the free binding potential for11C-WAY-100635 and distribution volume for11C-DASB.Results:The mean bias for generated transmission data was -1.06% ± 0.81%. Global biases in static PET uptake were -0.49% ± 1.7%, and -1.52% ± 0.73% for11C-WAY-100635 and11C-DASB, respectively.Conclusion:Our neural network approach is capable of synthesizing patient-specific transmission data with sufficient accuracy for both static and dynamic PET studies.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30166355/
"Dynamic whole-body PET imaging: principles, potentials and applications","Arman Rahmim, Martin A Lodge, Nicolas A Karakatsanis, Vladimir Y Panin, Yun Zhou, Alan McMillan, Steve Cho, Habib Zaidi, Michael E Casey, Richard L Wahl","Purpose: In this article, we discuss dynamic whole-body (DWB) positron emission tomography (PET) as an imaging tool with significant clinical potential, in relation to conventional standard uptake value (SUV) imaging.

Background: DWB PET involves dynamic data acquisition over an extended axial range, capturing tracer kinetic information that is not available with conventional static acquisition protocols. The method can be performed within reasonable clinical imaging times, and enables generation of multiple types of PET images with complementary information in a single imaging session. Importantly, DWB PET can be used to produce multi-parametric images of (i) Patlak slope (influx rate) and (ii) intercept (referred to sometimes as ""distribution volume""), while also providing (iii) a conventional 'SUV-equivalent' image for certain protocols.

Results: We provide an overview of ongoing efforts (primarily focused on FDG PET) and discuss potential clinically relevant applications.

Conclusion: Overall, the framework of DWB imaging [applicable to both PET/CT(computed tomography) and PET/MRI (magnetic resonance imaging)] generates quantitative measures that may add significant value to conventional SUV image-derived measures, with limited pitfalls as we also discuss in this work.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30269154/
First-in-Human Assessment of the Novel PDE2A PET Radiotracer 18F-PF-05270430,"Mika Naganawa, Rikki N Waterhouse, Nabeel Nabulsi, Shu-Fei Lin, David Labaree, Jim Ropchan, Sanela Tarabar, Nicholas DeMartinis, Adam Ogden, Anindita Banerjee, Yiyun Huang, Richard E Carson","This was a first-in-human study of the novel phosphodiesterase-2A (PDE2A) PET ligand (18)F-PF-05270430. The primary goals were to determine the appropriate tracer kinetic model to quantify brain uptake and to examine the within-subject test-retest variability.

Methods: In advance of human studies, radiation dosimetry was determined in nonhuman primates. Six healthy male subjects participated in a test-retest protocol with dynamic scans and metabolite-corrected input functions. Nine brain regions of interest were studied, including the striatum, white matter, neocortical regions, and cerebellum. Multiple modeling methods were applied to calculate volume of distribution (VT) and binding potentials relative to the nondisplaceable tracer in tissue (BPND), concentration of tracer in plasma (BPP), and free tracer in tissue (BPF). The cerebellum was selected as a reference region to calculate binding potentials.

Results: The dosimetry study provided an effective dose of less than 0.30 mSv/MBq, with the gallbladder as the critical organ; the human target dose was 185 MBq. There were no adverse events or clinically detectable pharmacologic effects reported. Tracer uptake was highest in the striatum, followed by neocortical regions and white matter, and lowest in the cerebellum. Regional time-activity curves were well fit by multilinear analysis-1, and a 70-min scan duration was sufficient to quantify VT and the binding potentials. BPND, with mean values ranging from 0.3 to 0.8, showed the best intrasubject and intersubject variability and reliability. Test-retest variability in the whole brain (excluding the cerebellum) of VT, BPND, and BPP were 8%, 16%, and 17%, respectively.

Conclusion: (18)F-PF-05270430 shows promise as a PDE2A PET ligand, albeit with low binding potential values.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27103022/
Dual-tracer PET using generalized factor analysis of dynamic sequences,"Georges El Fakhri, Cathryn M Trott, Arkadiusz Sitek, Ali Bonab, Nathaniel M Alpert","Purpose: With single-photon emission computed tomography, simultaneous imaging of two physiological processes relies on discrimination of the energy of the emitted gamma rays, whereas the application of dual-tracer imaging to positron emission tomography (PET) imaging has been limited by the characteristic 511-keV emissions.

Procedures: To address this limitation, we developed a novel approach based on generalized factor analysis of dynamic sequences (GFADS) that exploits spatio-temporal differences between radiotracers and applied it to near-simultaneous imaging of 2-deoxy-2-[(18)F]fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) (brain metabolism) and (11)C-raclopride (D2) with simulated human data and experimental rhesus monkey data. We show theoretically and verify by simulation and measurement that GFADS can separate FDG and raclopride measurements that are made nearly simultaneously.

Results: The theoretical development shows that GFADS can decompose the studies at several levels: (1) It decomposes the FDG and raclopride study so that they can be analyzed as though they were obtained separately. (2) If additional physiologic/anatomic constraints can be imposed, further decomposition is possible. (3) For the example of raclopride, specific and nonspecific binding can be determined on a pixel-by-pixel basis. We found good agreement between the estimated GFADS factors and the simulated ground truth time activity curves (TACs), and between the GFADS factor images and the corresponding ground truth activity distributions with errors less than 7.3 ± 1.3 %. Biases in estimation of specific D2 binding and relative metabolism activity were within 5.9 ± 3.6 % compared to the ground truth values. We also evaluated our approach in simultaneous dual-isotope brain PET studies in a rhesus monkey and obtained accuracy of better than 6 % in a mid-striatal volume, for striatal activity estimation.

Conclusions: Dynamic image sequences acquired following near-simultaneous injection of two PET radiopharmaceuticals can be separated into components based on the differences in the kinetics, provided their kinetic behaviors are distinct.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23636489/
Dimeric [(68)Ga]DOTA-RGD peptide targeting αvβ 3 integrin reveals extracellular matrix alterations after myocardial infarction,"Max Kiugel, Ingrid Dijkgraaf, Ville Kytö, Semi Helin, Heidi Liljenbäck, Tiina Saanijoki, Cheng-Bin Yim, Vesa Oikonen, Pekka Saukko, Juhani Knuuti, Anne Roivainen, Antti Saraste","Purpose: We evaluated a dimeric RGD-peptide, [(68)Ga]DOTA-E-[c(RGDfK)]2, for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of myocardial integrin expression associated with extracellular matrix remodeling after myocardial infarction (MI) in rat.

Procedures: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were studied at 7 days and 4 weeks after MI induced by permanent ligation of the left coronary artery and compared with sham-operated controls.

Results: In vivo imaging revealed higher tracer uptake in the infarcted area than in the remote non-infarcted myocardium of the same rats both at 7 days (MI/remote ratio, 2.25 ± 0.24) and 4 weeks (MI/remote ratio, 2.13 ± 0.37) post-MI. Compared with sham-operated rats, tracer uptake was higher also in the remote, non-infarcted myocardium of MI rats both at 7 days and 4 weeks where it coincided with an increased interstitial fibrosis. Standardized uptake values correlated well with the results of tracer kinetic modeling. Autoradiography confirmed the imaging results showing 5.1 times higher tracer uptake in the infarcted than remote area. Tracer uptake correlated with the amount of β3 integrin subunits in the infarcted area.

Conclusions: Our results show that integrin-targeting [(68)Ga]DOTA-E-[c(RGDfK)]2 is a potential tracer for monitoring of myocardial extracellular matrix remodeling after MI using PET.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24984688/
Plasma pharmacokinetic evaluation of cytotoxic agents radiolabelled with positron emitting radioisotopes,"A Saleem, E O Aboagye, J C Matthews, P M Price","Purpose: This study aimed to evaluate the utility of plasma pharmacokinetic analyses of anti-cancer agents from data obtained during positron emission tomography (PET) oncology studies of radiolabelled anti-cancer agents.

Patients and methods: Thirteen patients were administered fluorine-18 radiolabelled 5-FU ([(18)F]5-FU) admixed with 5-FU, corresponding to a total 5-FU dose of 380-407 mg/m2 (eight patients) and 1 mg/m2 (five patients). Nine patients received 2.2-19.2 microg/m2 of carbon-11 radiolabelled N-[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl]acridine-4-carboxamide ([11C]DACA) at 1/1,000th of phase I dose, as part of phase 0 microdosing study. Radioactivity of parent drug obtained from arterial blood samples, the injected activity of the radiolabelled drug, and the total dose of injected drug were used to obtain plasma drug concentrations. Plasma pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated using model-dependent and model-independent methods.

Results: 5-FU plasma concentrations at therapeutic doses were above the Km and a single compartment kinetic model was best used to fit the kinetics, with a mean half-life of 8.6 min. Clearance and volumes of distribution (Vd) obtained using both model-dependent and model-independent methods were similar. Mean (SE) clearance was 1,421(144), ml min(-1) and 1,319 (119) ml min(-1) and the mean (SE) Vd was 17.3 (1.8) l and 16.3 (1.9) l by the model-independent method and model-dependent methods, respectively. In contrast, with 1 mg/m2, plasma concentrations of 5-FU were less than the Km and a two-compartment model was used to best fit the kinetics, with the mean 5-FU half-life of 6.5 min. The mean (SE) clearances obtained by the model-independent method and model-dependent methods were 3,089 (314) ml min(-1) and 2,225 (200) ml min(-1), respectively and the mean (SE) Vd were 27.9 (7.0) l and 2.3 (0.4) l, by the model independent and dependent methods, respectively. Extrapolation of AUC0-Clast to AUC0-infinity was less than 3% in both these cohort of patients. A two-compartment model with a mean half-life of 42.1 min was used to best fit the kinetics of DACA; considerable extrapolation (mean 26%) was required to obtain AUC0-infinity from AUC0-Clast. Mean (SE) clearance of DACA was 1,920 (269) ml min(-1), with the model-independent method and 1,627 (287) ml min(-1) with the model-dependent method. Similarly, Vd [mean (SE)] of DACA with the model-independent and model-dependent methods were 118 (22) l and 50 (15) l, respectively.

Conclusions: Pharmacokinetic parameters can be estimated with confidence from PET studies for agents given at therapeutic doses, whose half-lives are significantly less than the total sampling time during the scan. Tracer studies performed alone, wherein plasma levels below the Km are expected, may also provide valuable information on drug clearance for the entire range of linear kinetics. However, drugs with half-lives longer than the sampling duration are inappropriate for PET plasma pharmacokinetic evaluation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17639391/
Application of a kinetic model on the methionine accumulation in intracranial tumours studied with positron emission tomography,"K Ericson, G Blomqvist, M Bergström, L Eriksson, S Stone-Elander","Eleven patients were studied with positron emission tomography (PET) using 11C-methionine. They all had low-grade astrocytomas (Kernohan grade II). The PET studies were analyzed with a metabolic model to obtain values for the influx, the accumulation rate and the partition coefficient of methionine in normal and tumourous tissue. Seven of the tumours showed an increased accumulation of methionine as compared with normal tissue on the static PET scans and also had higher values as to the kinetic parameters. Four tumours had a methionine accumulation equal to or lower than that of normal tissue and the kinetic parameters were also lower. Application of the kinetic model did not aid significantly in the delineation of the tumours. There was a correlation between the three parameters indicating an adaptation of the transport of methionine to the regional metabolic demand. The accumulation rate for normal cortical tissue was 0.49 nmol/g/min, the influx 0.97 nmol/ml and the partition coefficient 0.45 ml/g. These values are considerably higher than those previously reported. The differences might be attributed to differences in the corrections introduced for i.a. the occurrence of labelled metabolites in serum. With the use of a kinetic model, more information about the tracer is utilized and gained compared with the previously used graphic approach.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2960339/
L-3-11C-lactate as a PET tracer of myocardial lactate metabolism: a feasibility study,"Pilar Herrero, Carmen S Dence, Andrew R Coggan, Zulfia Kisrieva-Ware, Paul Eisenbeis, Robert J Gropler","Lactate is a key myocardial energy source. Lactate metabolism is altered in a variety of conditions, such as exercise and diabetes mellitus. However, to our knowledge, noninvasive quantitative measurements of myocardial lactate metabolism have never been performed because of the lack of an adequate radiotracer. In this study we tested L-3-(11)C-lactate ((11)C-lactate) as such a tracer.

Methods: Twenty-three dogs were studied under a wide range of metabolic interventions. (11)C-Lactate and (13)C-lactate were injected as boluses and PET data were acquired for 1 h. Concomitant arterial and coronary sinus (ART/CS) blood samples were collected to identify (13)C-lactate metabolites and to measure fractional myocardial extraction/production of (11)C metabolite fractions ((11)C acidic: (11)CO(2) and (11)C-lactate; (11)C basic: (11)C-labeled amino acids; and (11)C neutral: (11)C-glucose). Lactate metabolism was quantified using 2 PET approaches: monoexponential clearance analysis (oxidation only) and kinetic modeling of PET (11)C-myocardial curves.

Results: Arterial (11)C acidic, neutral, and basic metabolites were identified as primarily (11)C-labeled lactate + pyruvate, glucose, and alanine, respectively. Despite a significant contribution of (11)C-glucose (23%-45%) and (11)C-alanine (<11%) to total arterial (11)C activity, both were minimally extracted(+)/produced(-) by the heart (1.7% +/- 1.0% and -0.12% +/- 0.84%, respectively). Whereas extraction of (11)C-lactate correlated nonlinearly with that of unlabeled lactate extraction (r = 0.86, P < 0.0001), (11)CO(2) production correlated linearly with extraction of unlabeled lactate (r = 0.89, P < 0.0001, slope = 1.20 +/- 0.13). In studies with physiologic free fatty acids (FFA) (415 +/- 216 nmol/mL), (11)C-lactate was highly extracted (32% +/- 12%) and oxidized (26% +/- 14%), and PET monoexponential clearance and kinetic modeling analyses resulted in accurate estimates of lactate oxidation and metabolism. In contrast, supraphysiologic levels of plasma FFA (4,111 +/- 1,709 nmol/mL) led to poor PET estimates of lactate metabolism due to negligible lactate oxidation (1% +/- 2%) and complete backdiffusion of unmetabolized (11)C-lactate into the vasculature (28% +/- 22%).

Conclusion: Under conditions of net lactate extraction, L-3-(11)C-lactate faithfully traces myocardial metabolism of exogenous lactate. Furthermore, in physiologic substrate environments, noninvasive measurements of lactate metabolism are feasible with PET using myocardial clearance analysis (oxidation) or compartmental modeling. Thus, L-3-(11)C-lactate should prove quite useful in widening our understanding of the role that lactate oxidation plays in the heart and other tissues and organs.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18056334/
Quantitative dynamic ¹⁸FDG-PET and tracer kinetic analysis of soft tissue sarcomas,"Espen Rusten, Jan Rødal, Mona E Revheim, Arne Skretting, Oyvind S Bruland, Eirik Malinen","Purpose: To study soft tissue sarcomas using dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) with the glucose analog tracer [(18)F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose ((18)FDG), to investigate correlations between derived PET image parameters and clinical characteristics, and to discuss implications of dynamic PET acquisition (D-PET).

Material and methods: D-PET images of 11 patients with soft tissue sarcomas were analyzed voxel-by-voxel using a compartment tracer kinetic model providing estimates of transfer rates between the vascular, non-metabolized, and metabolized compartments. Furthermore, standard uptake values (SUVs) in the early (2 min p.i.; SUVE) and late (45 min p.i.; SUVL) phases of the PET acquisition were obtained. The derived transfer rates K1, k2 and k3, along with the metabolic rate of (18)FDG (MRFDG) and the vascular fraction νp, was fused with the computed tomography (CT) images for visual interpretation. Correlations between D-PET imaging parameters and clinical parameters, i.e. tumor size, grade and clinical status, were calculated with a significance level of 0.05.

Results: The temporal uptake pattern of (18)FDG in the tumor varied considerably from patient to patient. SUVE peak was higher than SUVL peak for four patients. The images of the rate constants showed a systematic pattern, often with elevated intensity in the tumors compared to surrounding tissue. Significant correlations were found between SUVE/L and some of the rate parameters.

Conclusions: Dynamic (18)FDG-PET may provide additional valuable information on soft tissue sarcomas not obtainable from conventional (18)FDG-PET. The prognostic role of dynamic imaging should be investigated.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23198721/

Recently, several [11C]PK11195 analogues have been synthesized to improve binding stability and brain availability. [18F]VC701 was synthesized and validated in CD healthy rats by biodistribution and inhibition analysis. Imaging studies were also conducted on animals injected unilaterally in the striatum with quinolinic acid (QA) to evaluate the TSPO ligand uptake in a neuroinflammation/neurodegenerative model. [18F]VC701 was synthesized with a good chemical and radiochemical purity and specific activity higher than 37 GBq/μmol. Kinetic studies performed on healthy animals showed the highest tracer biodistribution in TSPO-rich organs, and preadministration of cold PK11195 caused an overall radioactivity reduction. Metabolism studies showed the absence of radiometabolites in the rat brain of QA lesioned rats, and biodistribution analysis revealed a progressive increase in radioactivity ratios (lesioned to nonlesioned striatum) during time, reaching an approximate value of 5 4 hours after tracer injection. These results encourage further evaluation of this TSPO radioligand in other models of central and peripheral diseases.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26044669/
A 5D computational phantom for pharmacokinetic simulation studies in dynamic emission tomography,"Fotis A Kotasidis, Charalampos Tsoumpas, Irene Polycarpou, Habib Zaidi","Introduction: Dynamic image acquisition protocols are increasingly used in emission tomography for drug development and clinical research. As such, there is a need for computational phantoms to accurately describe both the spatial and temporal distribution of radiotracers, also accounting for periodic and non-periodic physiological processes occurring during data acquisition.

Methods: A new 5D anthropomorphic digital phantom was developed based on a generic simulation platform, for accurate parametric imaging simulation studies in emission tomography. The phantom is based on high spatial and temporal information derived from real 4D MR data and a detailed multi-compartmental pharmacokinetic modelling simulator.

Results: The proposed phantom is comprised of three spatial and two temporal dimensions, including periodic physiological processes due to respiratory motion and non-periodic functional processes due to tracer kinetics. Example applications are shown in parametric [(18)F]FDG and [(15)O]H2O PET imaging, successfully generating realistic macro- and micro-parametric maps.

Conclusions: The envisaged applications of this digital phantom include the development and evaluation of motion correction and 4D image reconstruction algorithms in PET and SPECT, development of protocols and methods for tracer and drug development as well as new pharmacokinetic parameter estimation algorithms, amongst others. Although the simulation platform is primarily developed for generating dynamic phantoms for emission tomography studies, it can easily be extended to accommodate dynamic MR and CT imaging simulation protocols.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25082066/
Derivation of a compartmental model for quantifying 64Cu-DOTA-RGD kinetics in tumor-bearing mice,"Gregory Z Ferl, Rebecca A Dumont, Isabel J Hildebrandt, Amanda Armijo, Roland Haubner, Gerald Reischl, Helen Su, Wolfgang A Weber, Sung-Cheng Huang","Radiolabeled arginine-glycine-aspartate (RGD) peptides are increasingly used in preclinical and clinical studies to assess the expression and function of the alphavbeta3 integrin, a cellular adhesion molecule involved in angiogenesis and tumor metastasis formation. To better understand the PET signal obtained with radiolabeled RGD peptides, we have constructed a compartmental model that can describe the time-activity curves in tumors after an intravenous injection.

Methods: We analyzed 60-min dynamic PET scans obtained with 64Cu-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-N,N',N'',N'''-tetraacetic acid (DOTA)-RGD in 20 tumor-bearing severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice after a bolus dose (18,500 kBq [500 microCi]), using variations of the standard 2-compartment (4k) tissue model augmented with a compartment for irreversible tracer internalization. alphavbeta3 binding sites were blocked in 5 studies with a coinjection of cold peptide. In addition, 20 h after injection, static PET was performed on 9 of 20 mice. We fitted 2k (k3=k4=0), 3k (k4=0), 4k, and 4kc (k4=constant) models to the PET data and used several criteria to determine the best model structure for describing 64Cu-DOTA-RGD kinetics in mice. Akaike information criteria (AIC), calculated from model fits and the ability of each model to predict tumor concentration 20 h after tracer injection, were considered.

Results: The 4kc model has the best profile in terms of AIC values and predictive ability, and a constant k4 is further supported by Logan-Patlak analysis and results from iterative Bayesian parameter estimation. The internalization compartment allows quantification of the putative tracer internalization rate for each study, which is estimated here to be approximately an order of magnitude less than k3 and thus does not confound the apparent specific binding of the tracer to the tumor integrin during the first 60 min of the scan. Analysis of specific (S) and nonspecific or nondisplaceable (ND) binding using fitted parameter values showed that the 4kc model provided expected results when comparing alphavbeta3 blocked and nonblocked studies. That is, specific volume of distribution, [VS=(K1k3)/(k2k4)], is much higher than is nondisplaceable volume of distribution, [VND=(K1/k2)], in nonblocking studies (2.2+/-0.6 vs. 0.85+/-0.14); VS and VND are about the same in the blocking studies (0.46+/-1.6 vs. 0.56+/-0.09). Also, the ratio of static tumor and plasma measurements at 60 and 10 min [CT(60)/CP(10)] is highly correlated (RS=0.92) to tumor VS.

Conclusion: We have developed and tested a compartmental model for use with the 64Cu-DOTA-RGD PET tracer and demonstrated its potential as a tool for analysis and design of preclinical and clinical imaging studies.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19164244/
[A technique for a rapid imaging of regional CBF and partition coefficient using dynamic SPECT and N-isopropyl-p-[123I]iodoamphetamine (123I-IMP)],"H Itoh, H Iida, M Murakami, P M Bloomfield, S Miura, T Okudera, A Inugami, T Ogawa, J Hatazawa, H Fujita","IMP is a flow tracer due to a large first pass extraction fraction and high affinity in the brain, but significant clearance from the brain causes change of distribution when the scan start time is delayed. The purpose of the present study is to develop a new method to rapidly calculate a quantitative CBF image by taking into account for the clearance effects. A dynamic SPECT scan was performed on 5 subjects (4 patients with cerebral infarction and 1 normal volunteer) following slow intravenous infusion of 123I-IMP. The arterial input function was obtained by frequent blood sampling and by measuring an octanol extraction ratio for each sample. Firstly, non-linear least square fitting (NLS) was performed to investigate the tracer kinetics of 123I-IMP. The 3 compartment model analysis yielded negligibly small k3 (retaining rate constant) (0.0056 +/- 0.0128 (ml/ml/min)), and consistent k1 (transport rate constant) with those determined by 2 compartment model (2CM) analysis (r = 0.96, p < 0.001). In addition, k1 was consistent with CBF measured by 15O water PET technique. These observations suggested validity of using 2CM for describing the IMP tracer kinetics. Secondly, a weighted integration (WI) technique has been implemented to calculate rapidly images of CBF and partition coefficient (Vd). The WI technique yielded values of CBF (k1) and Vd (k1/k2). They were confirmed to be consistent with those determined by NLS technique (CBF; r = 0.99, p < 0.001, Vd; r = 0.99, p < 0.001), and calculated k1 agreed well with PET CBF (r = 0.91, p < 0.001). We observed changed Vd in infarcted patients. This supports an importance for calculating of Vd image. Vd image will provide additional clinical information because 123I-IMP binding mechanism may be related to cell viability.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8455338/

Background: It is unknown how MBF and MFR values from existing SPs agree for (82)Rb PET.

Methods: Rest and stress (82)Rb PET scans of 48 patients with suspected or known coronary artery disease were analyzed in 10 centers. Each center used 1 of 10 SPs to analyze global and regional MBF using the different kinetic models implemented. Values were considered to agree if they simultaneously had an intraclass correlation coefficient >0.75 and a difference <20% of the median across all programs.

Results: The most common model evaluated was the Ottawa Heart Institute 1-tissue compartment model (OHI-1-TCM). MBF values from 7 of 8 SPs implementing this model agreed best. Values from 2 other models (alternative 1-TCM and Axially distributed) also agreed well, with occasional differences. The MBF results from other models (e.g., 2-TCM and retention) were less in agreement with values from OHI-1-TCM.

Conclusions: SPs using the most common kinetic model-OHI-1-TCM-provided consistent results in measuring global and regional MBF values, suggesting that they may be used interchangeably to process data acquired with a common imaging protocol.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25306543/
Molecular Imaging-Derived Biomarker of Cardiac Nerve Integrity - Introducing High NET Affinity PET Probe 18F-AF78,"Xinyu Chen, Rudolf A Werner, Kazuhiro Koshino, Naoko Nose, Saskia Mühlig, Steven P Rowe, Martin G Pomper, Constantin Lapa, Michael Decker, Takahiro Higuchi","Background:Radiolabeled agents that are substrates for the norepinephrine transporter (NET) can be used to quantify cardiac sympathetic nervous conditions and have been demonstrated to identify high-risk congestive heart failure (HF) patients prone to arrhythmic events. We aimed to fully characterize the kinetic profile of the novel18F-labeled NET probe AF78 for PET imaging of the cardiac sympathetic nervous system (SNS) among various species.Methods:18F-AF78 was compared to norepinephrine (NE) and established SNS radiotracers by employingin vitrocell assays, followed by anin vivo PET imagingapproach with healthy rats, rabbits and nonhuman primates (NHPs). Additionally, chase protocols were performed in NHPs with NET inhibitor desipramine (DMI) and the NE releasing stimulator tyramine (TYR) to investigate retention kinetics in cardiac SNS.Results:Relative to other SNS radiotracers,18F-AF78 showed higher transport affinity via NET in a cell-based competitive uptake assay (IC500.42 ± 0.14 µM), almost identical to that of NE (IC50, 0.50 ± 0.16 µM, n.s.). In rabbits and NHPs, initial cardiac uptake was significantly reduced by NET inhibition. Furthermore, cardiac tracer retention was not affected by a DMI chase protocol but was markedly reduced by intermittent TYR chase, thereby suggesting that18F-AF78 is stored and can be released via the synaptic vesicular turnover process. Computational modeling hypothesized the formation of a T-shaped π-π stacking at the binding site, suggesting a rationale for the high affinity of18F-AF78.Conclusion:18F-AF78 demonstrated highin vitroNET affinity and advantageousin vivoradiotracer kinetics across various species, indicating that18F-AF78 is an SNS imaging agent with strong potential to guide specific interventions in cardiovascular medicine.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35673571/
Quantitative assessment of tumor metabolism using FDG-PET imaging,"W A Weber, M Schwaiger, N Avril","Positron emission tomography using the glucose analog fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET) provides a unique means of non-invasive assessment of tumor metabolism. Several approaches, of varying complexity, can be applied for quantitative image analysis. Previous studies have demonstrated that ""standardized uptake values"" (SUV) and simplified tracer kinetic modeling, using the ""Patlak-Gjedde""-analysis, provide highly reproducible parameters of tumor glucose utilization. Quantification of regional FDG uptake gives complementary information to visual image interpretation and provides objective criteria for differentiation between benign and malignant lesions. Moreover, quantification of tumor glucose metabolism is essential for assessment of therapy induced changes. Clinical studies in breast cancer and lymphoma suggest that serial FDG-PET studies allow the prediction of response early in the course of chemotherapy. Therefore, FDG-PET may be helpful in patient management by avoiding ineffective chemotherapy and supporting the decision to continue dose intense regimes. In addition, FDG-PET allows non-invasive assessment of tumor viability following chemo- and radiotherapy which permits individualized therapy management.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11091112/
Intra-individual comparison of ¹⁸F-FET and ¹⁸F-DOPA in PET imaging of recurrent brain tumors,"Clemens Kratochwil, Stephanie E Combs, Karin Leotta, Ali Afshar-Oromieh, Stefan Rieken, Jürgen Debus, Uwe Haberkorn, Frederik L Giesel","Background: Both (18)F-fluorodihydroxyphenylalanine ((18)F-DOPA) and (18)F-fluoroethyltyrosine ((18)F-FET) have already been used successfully for imaging of brain tumors. The aim of this study was to evaluate differences between these 2 promising tracers to determine the consequences for imaging protocols and the interpretation of findings.

Methods: Forty minutes of dynamic PET imaging were performed on 2 consecutive days with both (18)F-DOPA and (18)F-FET in patients with recurrent low-grade astrocytoma (n = 8) or high-grade glioblastoma (n = 8). Time-activity-curves (TACs), standardized uptake values (SUVs) and compartment modeling of both tracers were analyzed, respectively.

Results: The TAC of DOPA-PET peaked at 8 minutes p.i. with SUV 5.23 in high-grade gliomas and 10 minutes p.i. with SUV 4.92 in low-grade gliomas. FET-PET peaked at 9 minutes p.i. with SUV 3.17 in high-grade gliomas and 40 minutes p.i. with SUV 3.24 in low-grade gliomas. Neglecting the specific uptake of DOPA into the striatum, the tumor-to-brain and tumor-to-blood ratios were higher for DOPA-PET. Kinetic modeling demonstrated a high flow constant k1 (mL/ccm/min), representing cellular internalization through AS-transporters, for DOPA in both high-grade (k1 = 0.59) and low-grade (k1 = 0.55) tumors, while lower absolute values and a relevant dependency from tumor-grading (high-grade k1 = 0.43; low-grade k1 = 0.33) were observed with FET.

Conclusions: DOPA-PET demonstrates superior contrast ratios for lesions outside the striatum, but SUVs do not correlate with grading. FET-PET can provide additional information on tumor grading and benefits from lower striatal uptake but presents lower contrast ratios and requires prolonged imaging if histology is not available in advance due to a more variable time-to-peak.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24305717/
SPET in psychopharmacology,"R M Moresco, F Fazio","Positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission tomography (SPET) permit the in vivo assessment of human biological processes with methods originally developed for preclinical studies.

18F-FBPA as a tumor-specific probe of L-type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1): a comparison study with 18F-FDG and 11C-Methionine PET,"Tadashi Watabe, Hayato Ikeda, Shushi Nagamori, Pattama Wiriyasermkul, Yoko Tanaka, Sadahiro Naka, Yasukazu Kanai, Kohei Hagiwara, Masanao Aoki, Eku Shimosegawa, Yoshikatsu Kanai, Jun Hatazawa","Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of L-4-borono-2-18F-fluoro-phenylalanine (18F-FBPA) as a tumor-specific probe, in comparison to18F-FDG and11C-methionine (Met), focusing on its transport selectivity by L-type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1), which is highly upregulated in cancers.

Methods: Cellular analyses of FBPA were performed to evaluate the transportablity and Kmvalue. PET studies were performed in rat xenograft models of C6 glioma (n = 12) and in rat models of turpentine oil-induced subcutaneous inflammation (n = 9). The kinetic parameters and uptake values on static PET images were compared using the one-tissue compartment model (K1, k2) and maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax).

Results: The cellular analyses showed that FBPA had a lower affinity to a normal cell-type transporter LAT2 and induced less efflux through LAT2 among FBPA, Met, and BPA, while the efflux through LAT1 induced by FBPA was similar among the three compounds. The Kmvalue of18F-FBPA for LAT1 (196.8 ± 11.4 μM) was dramatically lower than that for LAT2 (2813.8 ± 574.5 μM), suggesting the higher selectivity of18F-FBPA for LAT1. K1and k2values were significantly smaller in18F-FBPA PET (K1= 0.04 ± 0.01 ml/ccm/min and k2= 0.07 ± 0.01 /min) as compared to11C-Met PET (0.22 ± 0.09 and 0.52 ± 0.10, respectively) in inflammatory lesions. Static PET analysis based on the SUVmax showed significantly higher accumulation of18F-FDG in the tumor and inflammatory lesions (7.2 ± 2.1 and 4.6 ± 0.63, respectively) as compared to both18F-FBPA (3.2 ± 0.40 and 1.9 ± 0.19) and11C-Met (3.4 ± 0.43 and 1.6 ± 0.11). No significant difference was observed between18F-FBPA and11C-Met in the static PET images.

Conclusion: This study shows the utility of18F-FBPA as a tumor-specific probe of LAT1 with low accumulation in the inflammatory lesions.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27550420/
"Estimation of regional cerebral utilization of [11C]-L-3,4-dihydroxy-phenylalanine (DOPA) in the primate by positron emission tomography","J Tedroff, S M Aquilonius, P Hartvig, H Lundqvist, P Bjurling, B Långström","The intracerebral kinetics of [11C]-labelled L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine, L-DOPA, was investigated in rhesus monkeys by positron emission tomography (PET). Through the labelling of the L-DOPA molecule in different positions and observation of a series of pharmacological challenges it was possible to establish that the kinetic conversion of the radiotracer in the striatum represents the process of decarboxylation to [11C]-labelled dopamine. The rate constant for this process can be estimated using a two-compartment model. The use of [11C]-L-DOPA and PET will thus provide a possibility for in vivo studies of blood-brain barrier transport of the amino acid as well as for the estimation of the ability for brain tissue to decarboxylate the tracer by the action of aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1574997/
Quantification of the glycine transporter 1 in rhesus monkey brain using [18F]MK-6577 and a model-based input function,"Sandra M Sanabria-Bohórquez, Aniket D Joshi, Marie Holahan, Lori Daneker, Kerry Riffel, Mangay Williams, Wenping Li, Jacquelynn J Cook, Terence G Hamill","Background: Glycine transporter 1 (GlyT1) inhibitors have emerged as potential treatments for schizophrenia due to their potentiation of NMDA receptor activity by modulating the local concentrations of the NMDA co-agonist glycine. [18F]MK-6577 is a potent and selective GlyT1 inhibitor PET tracer. Although differences in ligand kinetics can be expected between non-human primates and humans, the tracer pre-clinical evaluation can provide valuable information supporting protocol design and quantification in the clinical space. The main objective of this work was to evaluate the in vivo kinetics of [18F]MK-6577 in rhesus monkey brain. Additionally, a method for estimating the tracer input function from the tracer brain tissue kinetics and venous sampling was validated. This technique was applied for determination of the dose-occupancy relationship of a GlyT1 inhibitor in monkey brain.

Methods: Compartmental and Logan graphical analysis were utilized for quantification of the [18F]MK-6577 binding using the measured tracer arterial input function. The stability of the tracer volume of distribution relative to scan length was assessed. The proposed model-based input function method takes advantage of the agreement between the tracer concentration in arterial and venous plasma from ~5 min. The approach estimates the initial peak of the input curve by adding a gamma like function term to the measured venous curve. The parameters of the model function were estimated by simultaneously fitting several brain time activity curves to a compartmental model.

Results: Good agreement was found between the model-based and the measured arterial plasma curve and the corresponding distribution volumes. The Logan analysis was the preferred method of analysis providing reliable and stable volume of distribution and occupancy results using a 90 and possibly 60 min scan length.

Conclusion: The model-based input function method and Logan analysis are well suited for quantification of [18F]MK-6577 binding and GlyT1 occupancy in monkey brain.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21930214/
Structure-activity relationship studies of four novel 4-aminopyridine K+ channel blockers,"Sofia Rodríguez-Rangel, Alyssa D Bravin, Karla M Ramos-Torres, Pedro Brugarolas, Jorge E Sánchez-Rodríguez","4-Aminopyridine (4AP) is a specific blocker of voltage-gated potassium channels (KV1 family) clinically approved for the symptomatic treatment of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). It has recently been shown that [18F]3F4AP, a radiofluorinated analog of 4AP, also binds to KV1 channels and can be used as a PET tracer for the detection of demyelinated lesions in rodent models of MS. Here, we investigate four novel 4AP derivatives containing methyl (-CH3), methoxy (-OCH3) as well as trifluoromethyl (-CF3) in the 2 and 3 position as potential candidates for PET imaging and/or therapy. We characterized the physicochemical properties of these compounds (basicity and lipophilicity) and analyzed their ability to block Shaker K+channel under different voltage and pH conditions. Our results demonstrate that three of the four derivatives are able to block voltage-gated potassium channels. Specifically, 3-methyl-4-aminopyridine (3Me4AP) was found to be approximately 7-fold more potent than 4AP and 3F4AP; 3-methoxy- and 3-trifluoromethyl-4-aminopyridine (3MeO4AP and 3CF34AP) were found to be about 3- to 4-fold less potent than 4AP; and 2-trifluoromethyl-4-AP (2CF34AP) was found to be about 60-fold less active. These results suggest that these novel derivatives are potential candidates for therapy and imaging.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31919372/
On the applicability of [18F]FBPA to predict L-BPA concentration after amino acid preloading in HuH-7 liver tumor model and the implication for liver boron neutron capture therapy,"Catrin Grunewald, Michael Sauberer, Thomas Filip, Thomas Wanek, Johann Stanek, Severin Mairinger, Sofia Rollet, Petra Kudejova, Oliver Langer, Christian Schütz, Matthias Blaickner, Claudia Kuntner","Introduction: In recent years extra-corporal application of boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) was evaluated for liver primary tumors or liver metastases. A prerequisite for such a high-risk procedure is proof of preferential delivery and high uptake of a10B-pharmaceutical in liver malignancies. In this work we evaluated in a preclinical tumor model if [18F]FBPA tissue distribution measured with PET is able to predict the tissue distribution of [10B]L-BPA.

Methods: Tumor bearing mice (hepatocellular carcinoma cell line, HuH-7) were either subject of a [18F]FBPA-PET scan with subsequent measurement of radioactivity content in extracted organs using a gamma counter or injected with [10B]L-BPA with tissue samples analyzed by prompt gamma activation analysis (PGAA) or quantitative neutron capture radiography (QNCR). The impact of L-tyrosine, L-DOPA and L-BPA preloading on the tissue distribution of [18F]FBPA and [10B]L-BPA was evaluated and the pharmacokinetics of [18F]FBPA investigated by compartment modeling.

Results: We found a significant correlation between [18F]FBPA and [10B]L-BPA uptake in tumors and various organs as well as high accumulation levels in pancreas and kidneys as reported in previous studies. Tumor-to-liver ratios of [18F]FBPA ranged from 1.2 to 1.5. Preloading did not increase the uptake of [18F]FBPA or [10B]L-BPA in any organ and compartment modeling showed no statistically significant differences in [18F]FBPA tumor kinetics.

Conclusions: [18F]FBPA-PET predicts [10B]L-BPA concentration after amino acid preloading in HuH-7 hepatocellular carcinoma models. Preloading had no effect on tumor uptake of [18F]FBPA.

Advances in knowledge: Despite differences in chemical structure and administered dose [18F]FBPA and [10B]L-BPA demonstrate an equivalent biodistribution in a preclinical tumor model. IMPLICATIONS FOR PATIENT CARE: [18F]FBPA-PET is suitable for treatment planning and dose calculations in BNCT applications for liver malignancies. However, alternative tracers with more favorable tumor-to-liver ratios should be investigated.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27837726/

Despite RAGE's importance in these pathologies, there remains a need for a molecular imaging agent that can accurately assess RAGE levelsin vivo. Therefore, we have developed a multimodal nanoparticle-based imaging agent targeted at RAGE with the well-characterized RAGE ligand, carboxymethyllysine (CML)-modified human serum albumin (HSA).Methods:A multimodal tracer (64Cu-Rho-G4-CML) was developed using a generation-4 (G4) polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimer, conjugated with both rhodamine and copper-64 (64Cu) chelator (NOTA) for optical and PET imaging, respectively. First,64Cu-Rho-G4-CML and its non-targeted analogue (64Cu-Rho-G4-HSA) were evaluated chemically using techniques such as dynamic light scattering (DLS), electron microscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The tracers' binding capabilities were examined at the cellular level and optimized using live and fixed HUVEC cells grown in 5.5-30 mM glucose, followed byin vivoPET-CT imaging, where the probes' kinetics, biodistribution, and RAGE targeting properties were examined in a murine model of hindlimb ischemia. Finally, histological assessment of RAGE levels in both ischemic and non-ischemic tissues was performed.Conclusions:Our RAGE-targeted probe demonstrated an average size of 450 nm, a Kd of 340-390 nM, rapid blood clearance, and a 3.4 times greater PET uptake in ischemic RAGE-expressing hindlimbs than their non-ischemic counterpart. We successfully demonstrated increased RAGE expression in a murine model of hindlimb ischemia and the feasibility for non-invasive examination of cellular, tissue, and whole-body RAGE levels with a molecularly targeted tracer.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30429883/
The relationship between tumor aggressiveness and cholinergic PET imaging in prostate cancer tissue. A proof-of-concept study,"Maria M Nielsen, Lars P Tolbod, Michael Borre, Søren Høyer, Hendrik J Harms, Jens Sørensen, Jørgen Frøkiær, Per Borghammer","It was recently shown that high-risk prostate carcinoma (PCa) exhibited parasympathetic neurogenesis. The PET tracer11C-donepezil is a marker of parasympathetic innervation. Therefore, we studied if parasympathetic nerve density in PCa measured with11C-donepezil PET correlated with PCa aggressiveness and if metastases could be visualized. Twenty-six patients were included into three groups with varying tumor aggressiveness. Dynamic and static PET scans were performed. Maximal standardized uptake values (SUVmax) were determined in lesions within the prostate, lymph nodes, and bones. SUVmaxin primary PCa were compared between groups, and comparisons between SUVmaxand Gleason score and Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) were performed. Kinetic modelling was performed and time-activity curves of healthy tissue and tumor tissue fitted and compared. Tumor kinetic parameters were normalized to those of healthy tissue producing ratios of K1 and k2. Median SUVmaxin primary PCa was higher in high-grade compared to low-grade PCa (P = 0.052). No correlation was seen between Gleason score and SUVmax(P = 0.28). A trend-level correlation was seen between PSA and SUVmax(P = 0.078). Median SUVmaxwas 7.7 (4.7-22.5) for suspected lymph node metastases and 8.2 (5.4-14.8) for suspected bone metastases. A significant difference was seen between time-activity tissue curves for low- and high-grade PCa (P = 0.012). Highly significant differences were seen in K1- and k2-ratios between low- and high-grade PCa (P = 0.0006 and P < 0.0001). We showed that11C-donepezil accumulates in primary PCa and metastases. Simple SUVmaxvalues of the cancer hot spots were higher in high-risk tumors compared to low-risk tumors.

"[(11)C]UCB-A, a novel PET tracer for synaptic vesicle protein 2A","Sergio Estrada, Mark Lubberink, Alf Thibblin, Margareta Sprycha, Tim Buchanan, Nathalie Mestdagh, Benoit Kenda, Joel Mercier, Laurent Provins, Michel Gillard, Dominique Tytgat, Gunnar Antoni","Introduction: Development of a selective and specific high affinity PET tracer, [(11)C]UCB-A, for the in vivo study of SV2A expression in humans. Radiochemistry and preclinical studies in rats and pigs including development of a tracer kinetic model to determine VT. A method for the measurement of percent intact tracer in plasma was developed and the radiation dosimetry was determined in rats.

Results: 3-5GBq of [(11)C]UCB-A could be produced with radiochemical purity exceeding 98% with a specific radioactivity of around 65GBq/μmol. In vitro binding showed high selective binding towards SV2A. [(11)C]UCB-A displayed a dose-dependent and reversible binding to SV2A as measured with PET in rats and pigs and the VT could be determined by Logan analysis. The dosimetry was favorable and low enough to allow multiple administrations of [(11)C]UCB-A to healthy volunteers, and the metabolite analysis showed no sign of labeled metabolites in brain.

Conclusions: We have developed the novel PET tracer, [(11)C]UCB-A, that can be used to measure SV2A expression in vivo. The dosimetry allows up to 5 administrations of 400MBq of [(11)C]UCB-A in humans. Apart from measuring drug occupancy, as we have shown, the tracer can potentially be used to compare SV2A expression between individuals because of the rather narrow range of baseline VT values.

An animal model for in vivo evaluation of tumor glycolytic rates with positron emission tomography,"R A Hawkins, Y Choi, S Scates, S Rege, C K Hoh, J Glaspy, M E Phelps","We developed a method for evaluating tumor glycolytic rates in vivo with nude mice injected with 2-[F-18]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) and a dedicated animal positron emission tomography (PET) scanner. Animals were injected with NR-6 mouse fibroblast tumor cell lines. When tumors achieved a large enough size to be macroscopically visible, quantitative measurements of FDG uptake in vivo were obtained, using both standard nonlinear regression with the FDG tracer kinetic model to generate estimates of model parameters, including KNLR, the rate constant for net phosphorylation of FDG. Additionally, we determined the values of KPAT, the rate constant for net phosphorylation of FDG measured with a non-iterative graphical method. Estimates of K were highly correlated (r = 0.95) with both methods, and parametric images of KPAT demonstrate both the tumor location and size, but are also scaled in units of phosphorylation of FDG. The method is suitable for serial studies of tumor glucose metabolism during and after therapeutic interventions, such as chemotherapeutic trials.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8501902/
Noninvasive quantitative assessment of pulmonary blood flow with 18F-FDG PET,"Céline Pouzot, Jean-Christophe Richard, Antoine Gros, Nicolas Costes, Franck Lavenne, Didier Le Bars, Claude Guerin","Pulmonary blood flow (PBF) is a critical determinant of oxygenation during acute lung injury (ALI). PET/CT with (18)F-FDG allows the assessment of both lung aeration and neutrophil inflammation as well as an estimation of the regional fraction of blood (FB) if compartmental modeling is used to quantify (18)F-FDG pulmonary uptake. The aim of this study was to validate the use of FB to assess PBF, with PET and compartmental modeling of (15)O-H2O kinetics as a reference method, in both control animals and animals with ALI. For the purpose of studying a wide range of PBF values, supine and prone positions and various positive end-expiratory pressures (PEEPs) and tidal volumes (V(T)s) were selected.

Methods: Pigs were randomized into 3 groups in which ALI was induced by HCl inhalation: pigs studied in the supine position with a low PEEP (5 ± 3 [mean ± SD] cm of H2O; n = 9) or a high PEEP (12 ± 1 cm of H2O; n = 8) and pigs studied in the prone position with a low PEEP (6 ± 3 cm of H2O; n = 9). Also included were a control group that did not have ALI (n = 6) and 2 additional groups (n = 6 each) that had a high V(T) to maintain a transpulmonary pressure of greater than or equal to 35 cm of H2O and that either received HCl inhalation or did not receive HCl inhalation. PBF and FB were measured with PET and compartmental modeling of (15)O-H2O and (18)F-FDG kinetics in 10 lung regions along the anterior-to-posterior lung dimension, and both were expressed in each region as a fraction of their values in the whole lung.

Results: PBF and FB were strongly correlated (R(2) = 0.9), with a slope of the regression line close to unity and a negligible intercept. The mean difference between PBF and FB was 0, and the 95% limits of agreement were -0.035 to 0.035. This good agreement between methods was obtained in both normal and injured lungs and under a wide range of V(T), PEEP, and regional PBF values (7-71 mL/kg, 0-15 cm of H2O, and 24-603 mL·min(-1)·100 mL of lung(-1), respectively).

Conclusion: FB assessed with (18)F-FDG is a good surrogate for PBF in both normal animals and animals with ALI. PET/CT has the potential to be used to study ventilation, perfusion, and lung inflammation with a single tracer.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23907755/
Simultaneous emission and transmission (SET) scanning in neurological PET studies,"S R Meikle, S Eberl, P K Hooper, M J Fulham","Purpose: We evaluated the impact of simultaneous emission and transmission (SET) measurements of quantification and noise in neurological PET studies.

Method: Bias in SET was measured as a function of emission count rate and used to predict distortion in simulated FDG tissue curves and its effect on model parameter estimates. Studies were performed on a brain phantom and a patient to verify predicted bias and examine the effect of SET on noise.

Results: In static imaging, SET underestimated tracer concentration by approximately 2%. In kinetic studies, tracer concentration was overestimated initially and underestimated during the mid to late part of the study, but bias in measurement of glucose metabolic rate was < 5% by simulation and < 10% in the patient study. SET imaging takes 10% longer than the emission part of a conventional scan to achieve comparable statistics.

Conclusion: Accurate neurological PET studies can be performed with SET. The relatively small bias can be predicted and potentially corrected.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9135664/
Dynamic 18F-FDOPA-PET/MRI for the preoperative evaluation of gliomas: correlation with stereotactic histopathology,"Maria R Ponisio, Jonathan E McConathy, Sonika M Dahiya, Michelle M Miller-Thomas, Keith M Rich, Amber Salter, Qing Wang, Pamela J LaMontagne, Gloria J Guzmán Pérez-Carrillo, Tammie L S Benzinger","Background: MRI alone has limited accuracy for delineating tumor margins and poorly predicts the aggressiveness of gliomas, especially when tumors do not enhance. This study evaluated simultaneous 3,4-dihydroxy-6-[18F]fluoro-L-phenylalanine (FDOPA)-PET/MRI to define tumor volumes compared to MRI alone more accurately, assessed its role in patient management, and correlated PET findings with histopathology.

Methods: Ten patients with known or suspected gliomas underwent standard of care surgical resection and/or stereotactic biopsy. FDOPA-PET/MRI was performed prior to surgery, allowing for precise co-registration of PET, MR, and biopsies. The biopsy sites were modeled as 5-mm spheres, and the local FDOPA uptake at each site was determined. Correlations were performed between measures of tumor histopathology, and static and dynamic PET values: standardized uptake values (SUVs), tumor to brain ratios, metabolic tumor volumes, and tracer kinetics at volumes of interest (VOIs) and biopsy sites.

Results: Tumor FDOPA-PET uptake was visualized in 8 patients. In 2 patients, tracer uptake was similar to normal brain reference with no histological findings of malignancy. Eight biopsy sites confirmed for glioma had FDOPA uptake without T1 contrast enhancement. The PET parameters were highly correlated only with the cell proliferation marker, Ki-67 (SUVmax: r = 0.985,P= .002). In this study, no statistically significant difference between high-grade and low-grade tumors was demonstrated. The dynamic PET analysis of VOIs and biopsy sites showed decreasing time-activity curves patterns. FDOPA-PET imaging directly influenced patient management.

Conclusions: Simultaneous FDOPA-PET/MRI allowed for more accurate visualization and delineation of gliomas, enabling more appropriate patient management and simplified validation of PET findings with histopathology.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33312679/
In vivo and in vitro characterization of [18F]-FE-(+)-DTBZ as a tracer for beta-cell mass,"Olof Eriksson, Mahabuba Jahan, Peter Johnström, Olle Korsgren, Anders Sundin, Christer Halldin, Lars Johansson","Introduction: The positron emission tomography (PET) tracer 9-[(18)F]fluoroethyl-(+)-dihydrotetrabenazine ([(18)F]-FE-(+)-DTBZ) is a potential candidate for quantifying beta-cell mass in vivo. The purpose was to investigate in vitro and in vivo utility of this tracer for the assessment of beta-cell mass.

Methods: Three pigs were intravenously administered [(18)F]-FE-(+)-DTBZ and examined by PET/computed tomography. Binding parameters were estimated by kinetic modeling. In vitro k(D) and B(max) were determined by saturation binding studies of endocrine and exocrine human tissue homogenates. In vitro pancreatic uptake was determined by tissue autoradiography with pancreases from patients with types 1 (T1DM) and 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and healthy controls.

Results: [(18)F]-FE-(+)-DTBZ had a k(D) of 3.5+/-1.0 nM, a B(max) of 382+/-108 fmol/mg protein and a specificity of 89+/-1.8% in islet homogenates. The total exocrine uptake was lower and 65% was nondisplaceable. No uptake difference was observed in pancreatic tissue slices from patients with T1DM, T2DM or healthy controls. The in vivo porcine pancreatic uptake reached a peak of standardized uptake value (SUV) of 2.8 with a low distribution volume ratio in all animals. Moderate to high tracer uptake was identified in the bile system and in bone.

Conclusions: [(18)F]-FE-(+)-DTBZ binds to vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) with high specificity in pure islet tissue in vitro. However, there is high nondisplaceable binding to exocrine tissue. In addition, in vivo tracer metabolism and dehalogenation result in severe underestimation of porcine pancreatic VMAT2 expression and BCM. The results do not support [(18)F]-FE-(+)-DTBZ as a suitable tracer for in vivo beta-cell imaging.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20346875/
PET image reconstruction: a robust state space approach,"Huafeng Liu, Yi Tian, Pengcheng Shi","Statistical iterative reconstruction algorithms have shown improved image quality over conventional nonstatistical methods in PET by using accurate system response models and measurement noise models. Strictly speaking, however, PET measurements, pre-corrected for accidental coincidences, are neither Poisson nor Gaussian distributed and thus do not meet basic assumptions of these algorithms. In addition, the difficulty in determining the proper system response model also greatly affects the quality of the reconstructed images. In this paper, we explore the usage of state space principles for the estimation of activity map in tomographic PET imaging. The proposed strategy formulates the organ activity distribution through tracer kinetics models, and the photon-counting measurements through observation equations, thus makes it possible to unify the dynamic reconstruction problem and static reconstruction problem into a general framework. Further, it coherently treats the uncertainties of the statistical model of the imaging system and the noisy nature of measurement data. Since H(infinity) filter seeks minimummaximum-error estimates without any assumptions on the system and data noise statistics, it is particular suited for PET image reconstruction where the statistical properties of measurement data and the system model are very complicated. The performance of the proposed framework is evaluated using Shepp-Logan simulated phantom data and real phantom data with favorable results.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17354696/
"Hepatic Positron Emission Tomography: Applications in Metabolism, Haemodynamics and Cancer","Miikka-Juhani Honka, Eleni Rebelos, Simona Malaspina, Pirjo Nuutila","Evaluating in vivo the metabolic rates of the human liver has been a challenge due to its unique perfusion system. Positron emission tomography (PET) represents the current gold standard for assessing non-invasively tissue metabolic rates in vivo. Here, we review the existing literature on the assessment of hepatic metabolism, haemodynamics and cancer with PET. The tracer mainly used in metabolic studies has been [18F]2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (18F-FDG). Its application not only enables the evaluation of hepatic glucose uptake in a variety of metabolic conditions and interventions, but based on the kinetics of18F-FDG, endogenous glucose production can also be assessed. 14(R,S)-[18F]fluoro-6-thia-Heptadecanoic acid (18F-FTHA),11C-Palmitate and11C-Acetate have also been applied for the assessment of hepatic fatty acid uptake rates (18F-FTHA and11C-Palmitate) and blood flow and oxidation (11C-Acetate). Oxygen-15 labelled water (15O-H2O) has been used for the quantification of hepatic perfusion.18F-FDG is also the most common tracer used for hepatic cancer diagnostics, whereas11C-Acetate has also shown some promising applications in imaging liver malignancies. The modelling approaches used to analyse PET data and also the challenges in utilizing PET in the assessment of hepatic metabolism are presented.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35448508/
[Neuropharmacology and receptor studies in the elderly],C C Meltzer,"Functional brain imaging has provided unique and exciting opportunities to strengthen our knowledge of the biological substrate of the aging brain and neuropsychiatric disorders. Positron emission tomography (PET) is a particularly powerful tool for quantifying the neurobiological correlates of cognition, mood and behavior. Initial PET studies of aging, psychiatric disorders and neurodegenerative disease focused primarily on generalized physiological parameters such as cerebral blood flow and metabolism, and early neuroreceptor imaging studies relied on relatively non selective markers. New, selective receptor radioligands now offer a previously inaccessible means to investigate the dynamic relationships among neurochemistry, aging and psychopathology in vivo. This approach has substantial advantages over peripheral (platelet and cerebrospinal fluid) markers, neuroendocrine challenge studies, animal models, and postmortem receptor binding assays. Advances in tracer kinetic modeling, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to PET registration, radiochemistry techniques, instrumentation and image processing have helped pave the way for increased emphasis on functional imaging studies of neuropsychiatric disorders of the elderly. The capability to correct PET image data for the confounding effect of cerebral atrophy permits relationships among age related brain changes and neurobiological disease mechanisms to be more accurately examined in the course of normal aging and in elderly patient populations.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12402232/
"Investigation of dynamic SPECT measurements of the arterial input function in human subjects using simulation, phantom and human studies","Celeste D Winant, Carina Mari Aparici, Yuval R Zelnik, Bryan W Reutter, Arkadiusz Sitek, Stephen L Bacharach, Grant T Gullberg","Computer simulations, a phantom study and a human study were performed to determine whether a slowly rotating single-photon computed emission tomography (SPECT) system could provide accurate arterial input functions for quantification of myocardial perfusion imaging using kinetic models. The errors induced by data inconsistency associated with imaging with slow camera rotation during tracer injection were evaluated with an approach called SPECT/P (dynamic SPECT from positron emission tomography (PET)) and SPECT/D (dynamic SPECT from database of SPECT phantom projections). SPECT/P simulated SPECT-like dynamic projections using reprojections of reconstructed dynamic (94)Tc-methoxyisobutylisonitrile ((94)Tc-MIBI) PET images acquired in three human subjects (1 min infusion). This approach was used to evaluate the accuracy of estimating myocardial wash-in rate parameters K(1) for rotation speeds providing 180° of projection data every 27 or 54 s. Blood input and myocardium tissue time-activity curves (TACs) were estimated using spatiotemporal splines. These were fit to a one-compartment perfusion model to obtain wash-in rate parameters K(1). For the second method (SPECT/D), an anthropomorphic cardiac torso phantom was used to create real SPECT dynamic projection data of a tracer distribution derived from (94)Tc-MIBI PET scans in the blood pool, myocardium, liver and background. This method introduced attenuation, collimation and scatter into the modeling of dynamic SPECT projections. Both approaches were used to evaluate the accuracy of estimating myocardial wash-in parameters for rotation speeds providing 180° of projection data every 27 and 54 s. Dynamic cardiac SPECT was also performed in a human subject at rest using a hybrid SPECT/CT scanner. Dynamic measurements of (99m)Tc-tetrofosmin in the myocardium were obtained using an infusion time of 2 min. Blood input, myocardium tissue and liver TACs were estimated using the same spatiotemporal splines. The spatiotemporal maximum-likelihood expectation-maximization (4D ML-EM) reconstructions gave more accurate reconstructions than did standard frame-by-frame static 3D ML-EM reconstructions. The SPECT/P results showed that 4D ML-EM reconstruction gave higher and more accurate estimates of K(1) than did 3D ML-EM, yielding anywhere from a 44% underestimation to 24% overestimation for the three patients. The SPECT/D results showed that 4D ML-EM reconstruction gave an overestimation of 28% and 3D ML-EM gave an underestimation of 1% for K(1). For the patient study the 4D ML-EM reconstruction provided continuous images as a function of time of the concentration in both ventricular cavities and myocardium during the 2 min infusion. It is demonstrated that a 2 min infusion with a two-headed SPECT system rotating 180° every 54 s can produce measurements of blood pool and myocardial TACs, though the SPECT simulation studies showed that one must sample at least every 30 s to capture a 1 min infusion input function.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22170801/
"Imaging the cannabinoid CB1 receptor in humans with [11C]OMAR: assessment of kinetic analysis methods, test-retest reproducibility, and gender differences","Marc D Normandin, Ming-Qiang Zheng, Kuo-Shyan Lin, N Scott Mason, Shu-Fei Lin, Jim Ropchan, David Labaree, Shannan Henry, Wendol A Williams, Richard E Carson, Alexander Neumeister, Yiyun Huang","The Radiotracer [(11)C]OMAR was developed for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of cannabinoid type-1 receptors (CB1R). The objectives of the present study were to evaluate kinetic analysis methods, determine test-retest reliability, and assess gender differences in receptor availability. Dynamic PET data were acquired in 10 human subjects, and analyzed with one-tissue (1T) and two-tissue (2T) compartment models and by the Logan and multilinear analysis (MA1) methods to estimate regional volume of distribution (VT). The 2T model inclusive of a vascular component (2TV) and MA1 were the preferred techniques. Test-retest reliability of VT was good (mean absolute deviation ~9%; intraclass correlation coefficient ~0.7). Tracer parent fraction in plasma was lower in women (P<0.0001). Cerebral uptake normalized by body weight and injected dose was higher in men by 17% (P<0.0001), but VT was significantly greater in women by 23% (P<0.0001). These findings show that [(11)C]OMAR binding can be reliably quantified by the 2T model or MA1 method and demonstrate the utility of this tracer for in vivo imaging of CB1R. In addition, results from the present study indicate that gender difference in receptor binding should be taken into consideration when [(11)C]OMAR is used to quantify CB1R availability in neuropsychiatric disorders.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25833345/
Quantification of Dynamic [18F]FDG Pet Studies in Acute Lung Injury,"Elisabetta Grecchi, Mattia Veronese, Rosa Maria Moresco, Giacomo Bellani, Antonio Pesenti, Cristina Messa, Alessandra Bertoldo","Purpose: This work aims to investigate lung glucose metabolism using 2-deoxy-2-[(18)F]fluoro-D-glucose ([(18)F]FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging in acute lung injury (ALI) patients.

Procedures: Eleven ALI patients and five healthy controls underwent a dynamic [(18)F]FDG PET/X-ray computed tomography (CT) scan. The standardized uptake values (SUV) and three different methods for the quantification of glucose metabolism (i.e., ratio, Patlak, and spectral analysis iterative filter, SAIF) were applied both at the region and the voxel levels.

Results: SUV reported a lower correlation than the ratio with the net tracer uptake. Patlak and SAIF analyses did not show any significant spatial or quantitative (R(2) > 0.80) difference. The additional information provided by SAIF showed that in lung inflammation, elevated tracer uptake is coupled with abnormal tracer exchanges within and between lung tissue compartments.

Conclusions: Full kinetic modeling provides a multi-parametric description of glucose metabolism in the lungs. This allows characterizing the spatial distribution of lung inflammation as well as returning the functional state of the tissues.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26099506/
Epichaperome-targeted myocardial imaging by 124I-PU-H71 PET,"Sonia Mahajan, Milan Grkovski, Kevin D Staton, Susana Ravassa, Kwaku Domfe, H William Strauss, John L Humm, Pat B Zanzonico, Bradley J Beattie, Insang Cho, Eva M Burnazi, Josef J Fox, Heiko Schöder, Joseph R Osborne, Trisha Youn, Komal Jhaveri, Gabriela Chiosis, Mark P Dunphy","Background: The small molecule radiotracer124I-PU-H71 is an imaging biomarker of epichaperome formation. The tracer has been established to localize in tissues under chronic stress, specifically in cancer cells and neurodegenerative brain cells. A first-in-human imaging trial using positron emission tomography (PET) in cancer patients revealed unexpected tracer accumulation in the myocardium.

Purpose: To describe human124I-PU-H71 myocardial biodistribution and pharmacokinetics in a series of cancer patients with no history of cardiovascular disease.

Methods: 25 cancer patients (age 22-75 years, M:F - 7:18) with no history of cardiovascular disease received intravenous injections with microdose124I-PU-H71 while at rest, followed by dynamic and gated/non-gated PET image data acquisitions. Region-of-interest (ROI) analysis of left ventricular myocardium (LVmyo) and background left atrium quantified tracer concentrations as standardized uptake value (SUV) and uptake ratios. Kinetic rate constants were evaluated by a two-tissue compartment model.

Results: Myocardial accumulation of124I-PU-H71 was prominent in all patients, with median LVmyo SUVmean (interquartile range, IQR) of 2.8 (IQR, 2.13-3.29), 2.5 (IQR, 1.94-2.98), 2.4 (IQR, 1.73-3.31) and 1.0 (IQR, 0.61-2.45), and median LVmyo/blood-pool ratios of 1.9 (IQR, 1.57-2.38), 2.0 (IQR, 1.53-2.32), 3.6 (IQR, 2.91-4.06) and 3.9 (IQR, 2.62-5.08) at 1-9 min, 14-23 min, 3-4 h and 21-25 h, respectively on non-gated PET images. Myocardium showed peak uptake within 2 min post-injection, with sustained myocardial tracer-concentration at 4 h post-injection. Pharmacokinetic modeling revealed median K1= 0.45 ml/min/g (IQR, 0.38-0.62); k2= 0.47 min- 1(IQR, 0.27-0.71); k3= 0.16 min- 1(IQR, 0.09-0.26); and k4= 0.0038 min- 1(IQR, 0.0015-0.0057). Regional assessment demonstrated essentially uniform tracer uptake in LV and myocardial segments; with normal LVEF in all patients (mean 57.7 ± 3.5%); and no patients suffered cardiac events over subsequent 12-month period.

Conclusion: Our study finds human myocardial epichaperome expression, as quantified by124I-PU-H71 PET. Our data indicates PU-H71 PET merits further study as a myocardial epichaperome biomarker, with potential application in drug development, possibly as a biomarker in subclinical cardiac dysfunction.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39935517/
A comparison of PET imaging characteristics of various copper radioisotopes,"Heather Ann Williams, Simon Robinson, Peter Julyan, Jamal Zweit, David Hastings","Purpose: PET radiotracers which incorporate longer-lived radionuclides enable biological processes to be studied over many hours, at centres remote from a cyclotron. This paper examines the radioisotope characteristics, imaging performance, radiation dosimetry and production modes of the four copper radioisotopes, ( 60)Cu,( 61)Cu,( 62)Cu and( 64)Cu, to assess their merits for different PET imaging applications.

Methods: Spatial resolution, sensitivity, scatter fraction and noise-equivalent count rate (NEC) are predicted for( 60)Cu,( 61)Cu,( 62)Cu and( 64)Cu using a model incorporating radionuclide decay properties and scanner parameters for the GE Advance scanner. Dosimetry for( 60)Cu,( 61)Cu and( 64)Cu is performed using the MIRD model and published biodistribution data for copper(II) pyruvaldehyde bis(N(4)-methyl)thiosemicarbazone (Cu-PTSM).

Results: (60)Cu and( 62)Cu are characterised by shorter half-lives and higher sensitivity and NEC, making them more suitable for studying the faster kinetics of small molecules, such as Cu-PTSM.( 61)Cu and( 64)Cu have longer half-lives, enabling studies of the slower kinetics of cells and peptides and prolonged imaging to compensate for lower sensitivity, together with better spatial resolution, which partially compensates for loss of image contrast.( 61)Cu-PTSM and( 64)Cu-PTSM are associated with radiation doses similar to [(18)F]-fluorodeoxyglucose, whilst the doses for( 60)Cu-PTSM and( 62)Cu-PTSM are lower and more comparable with H(2) (15)O.

Conclusion: The physical and radiochemical characteristics of the four copper isotopes make each more suited to some imaging tasks than others. The results presented here assist in selecting the preferred radioisotope for a given imaging application, and illustrate a strategy which can be extended to the majority of novel PET tracers.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16258764/
Pharmacokinetic studies of ⁶⁸Ga-labeled Bombesin (⁶⁸Ga-BZH₃) and F-18 FDG PET in patients with recurrent gliomas and comparison to grading: preliminary results,"Antonia Dimitrakopoulou-Strauss, Marcel Seiz, Jochen Tuettenberg, Kirsten Schmieder, Michael Eisenhut, Uwe Haberkorn, Ludwig G Strauss","Purpose: Dynamic PET studies with a ⁶⁸Ga-Bombesin analog, the ⁶⁸Ga-BZH₃, were performed in patients with highly suspected recurrent gliomas to investigate the effect of the receptor scintigraphy on tumor grading. Furthermore, dynamic F-18 Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) studies were performed for comparison.

Methods: The study consisted of 15 patients with histologically confirmed recurrent gliomas. Dynamic PET scans using ⁶⁸Ga-BZH₃ and FDG were obtained on 2 different days within 1 week. Multivariate analysis was used for the evaluation of the kinetic data. Standardized uptake values were calculated and a compartment (2-tissue) as well as a noncompartment model was used for data evaluation of both tracers.

Results: The evaluation includes 6 patients with a WHO II, 6 patients with a WHO III, and 3 patients with a WHO IV recurrent gliomas. Of the 15 patients, 10 patients demonstrated an increased ⁶⁸Ga-BZH₃ uptake visually, 3 of them with a WHO II, 4 with a WHO III, and 3 with a WHO IV tumor. Of the 15 patients, 6 patients revealed an enhanced FDG metabolism visually, 3 of them with a WHO II, and 3 with a WHO III. None of the 3 patients with WHO IV tumor demonstrated an enhanced FDG-uptake. Discriminant analysis based on a combination of FDG influx and binding potential of ⁶⁸Ga-BZH₃ best discriminated between low- and high-grade gliomas with a correct classification rate of 100%.

Conclusions: ⁶⁸Ga-BZH₃ seems to be helpful in patients with recurrent gliomas for the differentiation between low- and high-grade gliomas. Overall, the quantitative evaluation was superior to the visual analysis and the parameters of the ⁶⁸Ga-BZH₃ kinetics were more helpful than those of FDG for the differentiation between low- and high-grade gliomas.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21220970/
Calculating an estimate of tissue integrated activity in 18F-FDG PET imaging using one SUV value,"Eric Laffon, Manuel Bardiès, Jacques Barbet, Roger Marthan","Background: A kinetic model analysis was recently proposed to estimate the 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) integrated activity in an arbitrary tissue that uses tracer uptake and release rate constants. The aim of the current theoretical paper was to estimate 18F-FDG integrated activity using one standardized uptake value (SUV).

Methods: A further kinetic model analysis allowed us to derive an analytical solution for integrated activity determination, involving both irreversible and reversible trapping. It only uses SUV, which is uncorrected for 18F physical decay (SUVuncorr, in g.mL-1) and is assessed about its peak value. Measurement uncertainty of the estimate was also assessed.

Results: In a tissue (volume V, in mL) that irreversibly traps 18F-FDG, the total number of disintegrations can be estimated as: ÃC = 162 * 105 * SUVuncorr * V * ID / W (ID, injected dose, in MBq; W, patient's weight, in kg), where SUVuncorr is a mean over V and is assessed between 55 and 110 min after tracer injection. The relative uncertainty ranges between 18% and 30% (the higher the uptake, the lower the uncertainty). Comparison with the previous Zanotti-Fregonara's model applied to foetus showed less than 16% difference. Furthermore, calculated integrated activity estimates were found in good agreement with Mejia's results for healthy brain, lung and liver that show various degrees of tracer trapping reversibility and various fractions of free tracer in blood and interstitial volume.

Conclusion: Estimation of integrated activity in an arbitrary tissue using one SUV value is possible, with measurement uncertainty related to required assumptions. A formula allows quick estimation that does not underestimate integrated activity so that it could be helpful in circumstances such as accidental exposure, or for epidemiologic purposes such as in patients having undergone several examinations.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23561423/
A new compartmental method for the analysis of liver FDG kinetics in small animal models,"Sara Garbarino, Valentina Vivaldi, Fabrice Delbary, Giacomo Caviglia, Michele Piana, Cecilia Marini, Selene Capitanio, Iolanda Calamia, Ambra Buschiazzo, Gianmario Sambuceti","Background: Compartmental analysis is a standard method to quantify metabolic processes using fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET). For liver studies, this analysis is complex due to the hepatocyte capability to dephosphorylate and release glucose and FDG into the blood. Moreover, a tracer is supplied to the liver by both the hepatic artery and the portal vein, which is not visible in PET images. This study developed an innovative computational approach accounting for the reversible nature of FDG in the liver and directly computing the portal vein tracer concentration by means of gut radioactivity measurements.

Methods: Twenty-one mice were subdivided into three groups: the control group 'CTR' (n = 7) received no treatment, the short-term starvation group 'STS' (n = 7) was submitted to food deprivation with free access to water within 48 h before imaging, and the metformin group 'MTF' (n = 7) was treated with metformin (750 mg/Kg per day) for 1 month. All mice underwent a dynamic micro-PET study for 50 min after an (18)F-FDG injection. The compartmental analysis considered two FDG pools (phosphorylated and free) in both the gut and liver. A tracer was carried into the liver by the hepatic artery and the portal vein, and tracer delivery from the gut was considered as the sole input for portal vein tracer concentration. Accordingly, both the liver and gut were characterized by two compartments and two exchange coefficients. Each one of the two two-compartment models was mathematically described by a system of differential equations, and data optimization was performed by applying a Newton algorithm to the inverse problems associated to these differential systems.

Results: All rate constants were stable in each group. The tracer coefficient from the free to the metabolized compartment in the liver was increased by STS, while it was unaltered by MTF. By contrast, the tracer coefficient from the metabolized to the free compartment was reduced by MTF and increased by STS.

Conclusions: Data demonstrated that our method was able to analyze FDG kinetics under pharmacological or pathophysiological stimulation, quantifying the fraction of the tracer trapped in the liver or dephosphorylated and released into the bloodstream.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26077542/
Reliable quantification of 18F-GE-180 PET neuroinflammation studies using an individually scaled population-based input function or late tissue-to-blood ratio,"Ralph Buchert, Meike Dirks, Christian Schütze, Florian Wilke, Martin Mamach, Ann-Katrin Wirries, Henning Pflugrad, Linda Hamann, Laura B N Langer, Christian Wetzel, Mario Lukacevic, Andras Polyak, Mariella Kessler, Carlotta Petrusch, Frank M Bengel, Lilli Geworski, Rainer Rupprecht, Karin Weissenborn, Tobias L Ross, Georg Berding","Purpose: Tracer kinetic modeling of tissue time activity curves and the individual input function based on arterial blood sampling and metabolite correction is the gold standard for quantitative characterization of microglia activation by PET with the translocator protein (TSPO) ligand18F-GE-180. This study tested simplified methods for quantification of18F-GE-180 PET.

Methods: Dynamic18F-GE-180 PET with arterial blood sampling and metabolite correction was performed in five healthy volunteers and 20 liver-transplanted patients. Population-based input function templates were generated by averaging individual input functions normalized to the total area under the input function using a leave-one-out approach. Individual population-based input functions were obtained by scaling the input function template with the individual parent activity concentration of18F-GE-180 in arterial plasma in a blood sample drawn at 27.5 min or by the individual administered tracer activity, respectively. The total18F-GE-180 distribution volume (VT) was estimated in 12 regions-of-interest (ROIs) by the invasive Logan plot using the measured or the population-based input functions. Late ROI-to-whole-blood and ROI-to-cerebellum ratio were also computed.

Results: Correlation with the reference VT(with individually measured input function) was very high for VTwith the population-based input function scaled with the blood sample and for the ROI-to-whole-blood ratio (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.989 ± 0.006 and 0.970 ± 0.005). The correlation was only moderate for VTwith the population-based input function scaled with tracer activity dose and for the ROI-to-cerebellum ratio (0.653 ± 0.074 and 0.384 ± 0.177). Reference VT, population-based VTwith scaling by the blood sample, and ROI-to-whole-blood ratio were sensitive to the TSPO gene polymorphism. Population-based VTwith scaling to the administered tracer activity and the ROI-to-cerebellum ratio failed to detect a polymorphism effect.

Conclusion: These results support the use of a population-based input function scaled with a single blood sample or the ROI-to-whole-blood ratio at a late time point for simplified quantitative analysis of18F-GE-180 PET.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32322915/
Parametric imaging of ¹⁸F-fluoro-3-deoxy-3-L-fluorothymidine PET data to investigate tumour heterogeneity,"M Veronese, G Rizzo, E O Aboagye, A Bertoldo","Purpose: [(18)F]Fluoro-3'-deoxy-3'-L-fluorothymidine ([(18)F]FLT) is a tissue proliferation marker which has been widely validated as a tumour-specific imaging tracer for PET. [(18)F]FLT uptake in breast cancer is generally quantified at the region level or through first-order statistical descriptors (mean or maximum value), approaches that ignore the known complexity and heterogeneity of cancer tissues. Our aims were: (1) to validate a robust and reproducible voxel-wise approach to the quantification of [(18)F]FLT PET data in breast cancer patients, and (2) to exploit the entire distribution of the [(18)F]FLT retention estimates and their variability in the tumour region for the prediction of early treatment response.

Methods: The dataset was derived from 15 patients with stage II-IV breast cancer, scanned twice before chemotherapy and once 1 week after therapy. Using RECIST criteria (after 60 days) nine patients were categorized as responders or nonresponders to treatment. Kinetic modelling (compartmental modelling, Patlak analysis and spectral analysis with iterative filter), tissue-to-plasma ratio and standardized uptake value were applied at the voxel level. Test-retest estimates were used to assess reproducibility and reliability of the [(18)F]FLT uptake values before and after therapy for responder/nonresponder prediction.

Results: All the methods provided a measure of [(18)F]FLT uptake that was reliable and reproducible with ICC >0.94. Moreover, a very strong correlation was found among the methods (R (2) > 0.81). All the methods provided a limited number of outliers (<20 % in tumour), with the exception of compartmental modelling (>25 %) which was therefore excluded from the prediction analysis. Differences between before and after therapy in mean voxel-wise uptake in tumour did not allow a complete responder/nonresponder classification. In contrast, considering the full estimate distributions within the tumour (changes in median and mode between before and after therapy) improved therapy response for all the analysed methods.

Conclusion: We showed that kinetic modelling (Patlak and spectral analysis with iterative filter) applied voxel-wise allows appropriate [(18)F]FLT uptake estimation in breast cancer with good reproducibility. Notably, this study indicated that a more comprehensive statistical investigation could improve tumour characterization and prediction of treatment response.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24705620/
[11C]- p-Hydroxyphenethylguanidine,"Kenneth T. Cheng, David M. Raffel, Yong-Woon Jung","[11C]-p-Hydroxyphenethylguanidine ([11C]-p-hydroxy-PG) is a radioligand developed for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of the cardiac sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and adrenergic tumors. It is a catecholamine analog labeled with11C, a positron emitter with a physical half-life (t½) of 20.4 min (1).

Many diseases affect the SNS, and imaging of pathologic changes of adrenergic transmission has been an important area of PET research (2, 3). Most postganglionic sympathetic neurons in the autonomic nervous system release the neurotransmitter norepinephrine (NE), which stimulates adrenergic receptors of various effector organs (4). There are different types of adrenergic receptors, and NE stimulates α1, β1, and certain β2receptors. The NE transporter (NET) is a transmembrane protein located in the adrenergic nerve terminals that are responsible for active reuptake (uptake-1) of NE released from neurons (5). Inside the neurons, NE is transported by the vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT2) into the neuronal vesicles and stored there until it is released on stimulation. Significant expression of NET is found in major organs of the SNS such as the heart and brain. The NET expression is also increased or altered in adrenergic tumors (6, 7). There is also substantial evidence that aberrations in cardiac SNS function contribute to the morbidity and mortality associated with cardiac diseases (8).

Molecular probes with structures closely related to NE can be used to assess the integrity of cardiac sympathetic innervation and image adrenergic tumors (9, 10). Single-photon emission tomography (SPECT) agents such as [123I]meta-iodobenzylguanidine ([123I]MIBG) has been developed and used for neuronal imaging (11). Efforts have been made to develop a positron-emitting tracer because of the inadequate quantitative information and lower spatial resolution obtained with SPECT imaging. PET molecular imaging probes such as(), [11C]norephinephrine, [11C]phenylephrine, andR-(–)-[11C]-epinephrine have been evaluated because they accumulate in nerve terminals in the same way that NE does (12-15). Although they all localize in cardiac sympathetic neurons, there are significant differences in their NET transport rates, enzyme metabolism, vesicular storage efficiency, and diffusion rates from neurons (16). All of the current probes also have cardiac sympathetic neuronal uptake rates that are too rapid for robust and reliable compartmental modeling of their kinetics. On the basis of this observation, Raffel et al. (1) proposed the development of new radioligands with slower neuronal uptake rates and a long neuronal retention time through storage vesicle trapping. Because many phenethylguanidines have avid neuronal uptake and long retention inside storage vesicles, they synthesized and evaluated a series of [11C]phenethylguanidine analogs. In their study, Raffel et al. (1) suggested that a minimum structural requirement for long neuronal retention is a β-carbon or phenyl ring hydroxyl group substitution. Among this group of [11C]phenethylguanidines, [11C]-p-hydroxy-PG appeared to be one of the most promising for detecting adrenergic tumors, with a high tumor/background radioactivity ratio in mice. In rats, [11C]-p-hydroxy-PG also exhibited high uptake in heart due to localization in cardiac sympathetic neurons, with low uptake in liver and lungs. A structurally related [11C]phenethylguanidine, N-[11C]guanyl-m-octopamine, showed greatly improved myocardial kinetics for quantitative tracer kinetic analyses in non-human primates.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20641521/
Is liver SUV stable over time in ¹⁸F-FDG PET imaging?,"Eric Laffon, Xavier Adhoute, Henri de Clermont, Roger Marthan","This work investigated whether (18)F-FDG PET standardized uptake value (SUV) is stable over time in the normal human liver.

Methods: The SUV-versus-time curve, SUV(t), of (18)F-FDG in the normal human liver was derived from a kinetic model analysis. This derivation involved mean values of (18)F-FDG liver metabolism that were obtained from a patient series (n = 11), and a noninvasive population-based input function was used in each individual.

Results: Mean values (±95% reliability limits) of the (18)F-FDG uptake and release rate constant and of the fraction of free tracer in blood and interstitial volume were as follows: K = 0.0119 mL·min(-1)·mL(-1) (±0.0012), k(R) = 0.0065·min(-1) (±0.0009), and F = 0.21 mL·mL(-1) (±0.11), respectively. SUV(t) (corrected for (18)F physical decay) was derived from these mean values, showing that it smoothly peaks at 75-80 min on average after injection and that it is within 5% of the peak value between 50 and 110 min after injection.

Conclusion: In the normal human liver, decay-corrected SUV(t) remains nearly constant (with a reasonable ±2.5% relative measurement uncertainty) if the time delay between tracer injection and PET acquisition is in the range of 50-110 min. In current clinical practice, the findings suggest that SUV of the normal liver can be used for comparison with SUV of suspected malignant lesions, if comparison is made within this time range.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21878481/

Negative bias would also arise in successive PET scans if clearance of the radioligand is slow, resulting in a carryover effect. We developed a method to (1) estimate the in vivo dissociation constant Kdof a radioligand from PET studies displaying a non-tracer carryover (NTCO) effect and (2) correct the NTCO bias in occupancy studies taking into account the plasma concentration of the radioligand and its in vivo Kd. This method was applied in a study of healthy human subjects with the histamine H3receptor radioligand [11C]GSK189254 to measure the PK-occupancy relationship of the H3antagonist PF-03654746. From three test/retest studies, [11C]GSK189254 Kdwas estimated to be 9.5 ± 5.9 pM. Oral administration of 0.1 to 4 mg of PF-03654746 resulted in occupancy estimates of 71%-97% and 30%-93% at 3 and 24 h post-drug, respectively. NTCO correction adjusted the occupancy estimates by 0%-15%. Analysis of the relationship between corrected occupancies and PF-03654746 plasma levels indicated that PF-03654746 can fully occupy H3binding sites ( ROmax= 100%), and its IC50was estimated to be 0.144 ± 0.010 ng/mL. The uncorrected IC50was 26% higher.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27207170/

On the analysis of functional PET (fPET)-FDG: baseline mischaracterization can introduce artifactual metabolic (de)activations,"Sean E Coursey, Joseph Mandeville, Murray B Reed, Grant A Hartung, Arun Garimella, Hasan Sari, Rupert Lanzenberger, Julie C Price, Jonathan R Polimeni, Douglas N Greve, Andreas Hahn, Jingyuan E Chen","Functional Positron Emission Tomography (fPET) with (bolus plus) constant infusion of [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose FDG), known as fPET-FDG, is a recently introduced technique in human neuroimaging, enabling the detection of dynamic glucose metabolism changes within a single scan. However, the statistical analysis of fPET-FDG data remains challenging because its signal and noise characteristics differ from both classic bolus-administration FDG PET and from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), which together compose the primary sources of inspiration for analytical methods used by fPET-FDG researchers. In this study, we present an investigate of how inaccuracies in modeling baseline FDG uptake can introduce artifactual patterns to detrended TAC residuals, potentially introducing spurious (de)activations to general linear model (GLM) analyses. By combining simulations and empirical data from both constant infusion and bolus-plus-constant infusion protocols, we evaluate the effects of various baseline modeling methods, including polynomial detrending, regression against the global mean time-activity curve, and two analytical methods based on tissue compartment model kinetics. Our findings indicate that improper baseline removal can introduce statistically significant artifactual effects, although these effects characterized in this study (~2-8%) are generally smaller than those reported by previous literature employing robust sensory stimulation (~10-30%). We discuss potential strategies to mitigate this issue, including informed baseline modeling, optimized tracer administration protocols, and careful experimental design. These insights aim to enhance the reliability of fPET-FDG in capturing true metabolic dynamics in neuroimaging research.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39484579/
Quantitative Rodent Brain Receptor Imaging,"Kristina Herfert, Julia G Mannheim, Laura Kuebler, Sabina Marciano, Mario Amend, Christoph Parl, Hanna Napieczynska, Florian M Maier, Salvador Castaneda Vega, Bernd J Pichler","Positron emission tomography (PET) is a non-invasive imaging technology employed to describe metabolic, physiological, and biochemical processes in vivo. These include receptor availability, metabolic changes, neurotransmitter release, and alterations of gene expression in the brain. Since the introduction of dedicated small-animal PET systems along with the development of many novel PET imaging probes, the number of PET studies using rats and mice in basic biomedical research tremendously increased over the last decade. This article reviews challenges and advances of quantitative rodent brain imaging to make the readers aware of its physical limitations, as well as to inspire them for its potential applications in preclinical research. In the first section, we briefly discuss the limitations of small-animal PET systems in terms of spatial resolution and sensitivity and point to possible improvements in detector development. In addition, different acquisition and post-processing methods used in rodent PET studies are summarized. We further discuss factors influencing the test-retest variability in small-animal PET studies, e.g., different receptor quantification methodologies which have been mainly translated from human to rodent receptor studies to determine the binding potential and changes of receptor availability and radioligand affinity. We further review different kinetic modeling approaches to obtain quantitative binding data in rodents and PET studies focusing on the quantification of endogenous neurotransmitter release using pharmacological interventions. While several studies have focused on the dopamine system due to the availability of several PET tracers which are sensitive to dopamine release, other neurotransmitter systems have become more and more into focus and are described in this review, as well. We further provide an overview of latest genome engineering technologies, including the CRISPR/Cas9 and DREADD systems that may advance our understanding of brain disorders and function and how imaging has been successfully applied to animal models of human brain disorders. Finally, we review the strengths and opportunities of simultaneous PET/magnetic resonance imaging systems to study drug-receptor interactions and challenges for the translation of PET results from bench to bedside.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31168682/
Comparison of parametric imaging and SUV imaging with [68 Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 using dynamic total-body PET/CT in prostate cancer,"Ruohua Chen, Yee Ling Ng, Xinlan Yang, Yinjie Zhu, Lianghua Li, Haitao Zhao, Yun Zhou, Gang Huang, Jianjun Liu","Purpose: Standardized uptake value (SUV) has been prevalently used to measure [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 activity in prostate cancer, but it is susceptible to multiple factors. Parametric imaging allows for absolute quantification of tracer uptake and provides a better diagnostic accuracy that is crucial for lesion detection. However, the clinical significance of total-body parametric imaging of [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 remains to be fully assessed. Therefore, the aim of our study is to delve into the diagnostic implications of total-body parametric imaging of [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT for patients with prostate cancer.

Methods: Twenty prostate cancer patients were included and underwent a dynamic total-body [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT scan. An irreversible two-tissue compartment model (2T3k) was fitted for each tissue time-to-activity curve, and the net influx rate (Ki) was obtained. The image quality and semi-quantitative analysis of lesion-to-background ratio (LBR), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) were compared between parametric images and SUV images.

Results: Kinetic modeling using 2T3k demonstrated favorable model fitting in both normal organs and lesions. All of the lesions detected on SUV images (55-60 min) could be detected on Kiimages. The correlation between Ki, SUVmean,and SUVmaxin both normal organs and pathological lesions was found to be positive and statistically significant. Conversely, a moderate positive correlations were found between Kiand K1(R = 0.69, P < 0.001; R = 0.61, P < 0.001) and Kiand k3(R = 0.69, P < 0.001; R = 0.62, P < 0.001), in normal organs and pathological lesions, respectively. Visual assessment in Kiimages showed less image noise and higher lesions conspicuity compared to SUV images. Kiimage-derived LBR, SNR, and CBR of pathological lesions including primary tumors (PTs), lymph node metastases (LNMs) and bone metastases (BMs), exhibited remarkably higher folds (1.4-3.6 folds) compared to those derived from SUV of corresponding lesions.

Conclusions: Total-body parametric imaging of [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 enhanced lesion contrast and improved lesion detectability compared to SUV images. This may potentially serve as an imaging biomarker and theranostic tool for precise diagnosis and treatment evaluation in prostate cancer patients.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37792025/
The Rise of Synaptic Density PET Imaging,"Guillaume Becker, Sylvestre Dammicco, Mohamed Ali Bahri, Eric Salmon","Many neurological disorders are related to synaptic loss or pathologies. Before the boom of positrons emission tomography (PET) imaging of synapses, synaptic quantification could only be achieved in vitro on brain samples after autopsy or surgical resections. Until the mid-2010s, electron microscopy and immunohistochemical labelling of synaptic proteins were the gold-standard methods for such analyses. Over the last decade, several PET radiotracers for the synaptic vesicle 2A protein have been developed to achieve in vivo synapses visualization and quantification. Different strategies were used, namely radiolabelling with either11C or18F, preclinical development in rodent and non-human primates, and binding quantification with different kinetic modelling methods. This review provides an overview of these PET tracers and underlines their perspectives and limitations by focusing on radiochemical aspects, as well as preclinical proof-of-concept and the main clinical outcomes described so far.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32422902/
APPIAN: Automated Pipeline for PET Image Analysis,"Thomas Funck, Kevin Larcher, Paule-Joanne Toussaint, Alan C Evans, Alexander Thiel","APPIAN is an automated pipeline for user-friendly and reproducible analysis of positron emission tomography (PET) images with the aim of automating all processing steps up to the statistical analysis of measures derived from the final output images. The three primary processing steps are coregistration of PET images to T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images, partial-volume correction (PVC), and quantification with tracer kinetic modeling. While there are alternate open-source PET pipelines, none offers all of the features necessary for making automated PET analysis as reliably, flexibly and easily extendible as possible. To this end, a novel method for automated quality control (QC) has been designed to facilitate reliable, reproducible research by helping users verify that each processing stage has been performed as expected. Additionally, a web browser-based GUI has been implemented to allow both the 3D visualization of the output images, as well as plots describing the quantitative results of the analyses performed by the pipeline. APPIAN also uses flexible region of interest (ROI) definition-with both volumetric and, optionally, surface-based ROI-to allow users to analyze data from a wide variety of experimental paradigms, e.g., longitudinal lesion studies, large cross-sectional population studies, multi-factorial experimental designs, etc. Finally, APPIAN is designed to be modular so that users can easily test new algorithms for PVC or quantification or add entirely new analyses to the basic pipeline. We validate the accuracy of APPIAN against the Monte-Carlo simulated SORTEO database and show that, after PVC, APPIAN recovers radiotracer concentrations within 93-100% accuracy.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30337866/
Pharmacokinetic evaluation of [18F]PR04.MZ for PET/CT imaging and quantification of dopamine transporters in the human brain,"Vasko Kramer, Carlos Juri, Patrick J Riss, Rossana Pruzzo, Cristian Soza-Ried, Jonathan Flores, Ana Hurtado, Frank Rösch, Pedro Chana-Cuevas, Horacio Amaral","Purpose: Dopamine transporters (DAT) modulate pre-synaptic dopamine and physiological functions such as movement and reward. DAT also mirrors disease state in neurological disorders, rendering it an essential diagnostic target. [18F]PR04.MZ is a new PET imaging agent for DAT with an improved affinity and selectivity profile, for which we here describe the complete pharmacokinetic evaluation in healthy controls.

Methods: Thirty-two healthy subjects underwent T1-weighted MRI and dynamic PET scans for 180 min with arterial blood sampling (n = 5) or 90 min without blood sampling (n = 25) after injection of 197.6 ± 12.2 MBq [18F]PR04.MZ. Blood and plasma metabolite analysis were performed. MRI-based normalization of brain images, delineation of VOIs, and kinetic modeling was conducted to determine distribution volumes (Vt) and binding potentials (BPnd). The impact of scan duration was evaluated and repeated PET scans were performed to assess test-retest variability (n = 5). A static imaging protocol has been validated for clinical applications.

Results: [18F]PR04.MZ showed rapid metabolization in circulation, very high uptake in striatum and midbrain, and very low non-specific binding. The two-tissue compartment model 2TCM provided best fits for measured time-activity-curves and calculated Vts in putamen, caudate, substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), and cerebellar cortex were 11.83, 9.73, 2.12, and 0.57, respectively. All non-invasive models correlated well with BPndvalues derived from 2TCM but underestimated DAT availability by about 28-33%. Of those, simplified reference tissue model (SRTM) provided the best fits, lowest Akaike Information Criteria values, and BPndvalues of 14.82, 11.95, and 2.63 in putamen, caudate, and SNpc, respectively. BPndestimates for striatal regions and SNpc were stable between 90 and 130 min post-injection. Test-retest results were excellent, showing low variability in all and excellent reliability in most relevant regions. Static imaging from 60 to 90-min post-injection is a viable alternative for quantification.

Conclusions: [18F]PR04.MZ is a PET tracer with very high affinity, selectivity, and specific uptake in striatum and midbrain. 2TCM and SRTM provide good fits, high and stable Vts or BPnds, and good test-retest reliability for precise quantification of DAT in human subjects.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31788709/
An update on the use of image-derived input functions for human PET studies: new hopes or old illusions?,"Tommaso Volpi, Lucia Maccioni, Maria Colpo, Giulia Debiasi, Amedeo Capotosti, Tommaso Ciceri, Richard E Carson, Christine DeLorenzo, Andreas Hahn, Gitte Moos Knudsen, Adriaan A Lammertsma, Julie C Price, Vesna Sossi, Guobao Wang, Paolo Zanotti-Fregonara, Alessandra Bertoldo, Mattia Veronese","Background: The need for arterial blood data in quantitative PET research limits the wider usability of this imaging method in clinical research settings. Image-derived input function (IDIF) approaches have been proposed as a cost-effective and non-invasive alternative to gold-standard arterial sampling. However, this approach comes with its own limitations-partial volume effects and radiometabolite correction among the most important-and varying rates of success, and the use of IDIF for brain PET has been particularly troublesome.

Main body: This paper summarizes the limitations of IDIF methods for quantitative PET imaging and discusses some of the advances that may make IDIF extraction more reliable. The introduction of automated pipelines (both commercial and open-source) for clinical PET scanners is discussed as a way to improve the reliability of IDIF approaches and their utility for quantitative purposes. Survey data gathered from the PET community are then presented to understand whether the field's opinion of the usefulness and validity of IDIF is improving. Finally, as the introduction of next-generation PET scanners with long axial fields of view, ultra-high sensitivity, and improved spatial and temporal resolution, has also brought IDIF methods back into the spotlight, a discussion of the possibilities offered by these state-of-the-art scanners-inclusion of large vessels, less partial volume in small vessels, better description of the full IDIF kinetics, whole-body modeling of radiometabolite production-is included, providing a pathway for future use of IDIF.

Conclusion: Improvements in PET scanner technology and software for automated IDIF extraction may allow to solve some of the major limitations associated with IDIF, such as partial volume effects and poor temporal sampling, with the exciting potential for accurate estimation of single kinetic rates. Nevertheless, until individualized radiometabolite correction can be performed effectively, IDIF approaches remain confined at best to a few tracers.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37947880/
MCP-Net: Inter-frame Motion Correction with Patlak Regularization for Whole-body Dynamic PET,"Xueqi Guo, Bo Zhou, Xiongchao Chen, Chi Liu, Nicha C Dvornek","Inter-frame patient motion introduces spatial misalignment and degrades parametric imaging in whole-body dynamic positron emission tomography (PET). Most current deep learning inter-frame motion correction works consider only the image registration problem, ignoring tracer kinetics. We propose an inter-frame Motion Correction framework with Patlak regularization (MCP-Net) to directly optimize the Patlak fitting error and further improve model performance. The MCP-Net contains three modules: a motion estimation module consisting of a multiple-frame 3-D U-Net with a convolutional long short-term memory layer combined at the bottleneck; an image warping module that performs spatial transformation; and an analytical Patlak module that estimates Patlak fitting with the motion-corrected frames and the individual input function. A Patlak loss penalization term using mean squared percentage fitting error is introduced to the loss function in addition to image similarity measurement and displacement gradient loss. Following motion correction, the parametric images were generated by standard Patlak analysis. Compared with both traditional and deep learning benchmarks, our network further corrected the residual spatial mismatch in the dynamic frames, improved the spatial alignment of PatlakKi/Vbimages, and reduced normalized fitting error. With the utilization of tracer dynamics and enhanced network performance, MCP-Net has the potential for further improving the quantitative accuracy of dynamic PET.

Imaging of blood flow and hypoxia in head and neck cancer: initial evaluation with [(15)O]H(2)O and [(18)F]fluoroerythronitroimidazole PET,"K Lehtiö, V Oikonen, T Grönroos, O Eskola, K Kalliokoski, J Bergman, O Solin, R Grénman, P Nuutila, H Minn","Hypoxia is a characteristic feature of malignant tumors that should be evaluated before the start of therapy. (18)F-labeled fluoroerythronitroimidazole (FETNIM) is a possible candidate for imaging tumor hypoxia with PET. Quantitative analysis of [(18)F]FETNIM uptake in vivo is necessary before proceeding to assays predicting hypoxia.

Methods: Eight patients with untreated head and neck squamous cell carcinoma were enrolled in the study. All patients underwent dynamic PET imaging with [(18)F]FETNIM, coupled with measurements of blood flow with [(15)O]H(2)O and blood volume with [(15)O]CO. The metabolically active tumor volume was determined from [(18)F]FDG PET performed on a separate day. [(18)F]FETNIM uptake in the tumor was correlated with that in neck muscles and arterial plasma and compared with the findings of other PET studies.

Results: Blood flow in tumor was 5- to 30-fold greater than in muscle, in contrast to blood volume, which did not significantly differ in the 2 tissues. With [(18)F]FETNIM PET, muscle activity remained invariably less than plasma activity, whereas activity in whole tumors was always greater than that in muscle. In 4 instances, the maximum tumor uptake of [(18)F]FETNIM was 1.2-2.0 times higher than plasma activity in the late dynamic phase. A kinetic model developed for calculation of distribution volume of reversibly trapping tracers was successfully applied in the [(18)F]FETNIM studies. Tumor distribution volume correlated strongly with the standardized uptake value of [(18)F]FETNIM between 60 and 120 min and with blood flow but not with the standardized uptake value of [(18)F]FDG. The relationship between [(18)F]FETNIM uptake and the blood flow of the tumor was less obvious on a pixel-by-pixel level.

Conclusion: Uptake of [(18)F]FETNIM in head and neck cancer is highly variable and seems to be governed by blood flow at least in the early phase of tissue accumulation. Maximum tumor-to-muscle tracer uptake ratios > 180 min were in the range of 1-4, comparing favorably with those reported previously for [(18)F]fluoromisonidazole. Assessment of the distribution volume of [(18)F]FETNIM after the initial blood-flow phase is feasible for subsequent evaluation of hypoxia-specific retention.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11696633/
An automated method for delineating a reference region using masked volumewise principal-component analysis in 11C-PIB PET,"Pasha Razifar, Henry Engler, Anna Ringheim, Sergio Estrada, Anders Wall, Bengt Långström","Kinetic modeling using a reference region is a common method for the analysis of dynamic PET studies. Available methods for outlining regions of interest representing reference regions are usually time-consuming and difficult and tend to be subjective; therefore, MRI is used to help physicians and experts to define regions of interest with higher precision. The current work introduces a fast and automated method to delineate the reference region of images obtained from an N-methyl-(11)C-2-(4'-methylaminophenyl)-6-hydroxy-benzothiazole ((11)C-PIB) PET study on Alzheimer disease patients and healthy controls using a newly introduced masked volumewise principal-component analysis.

Methods: The analysis was performed on PET studies from 22 Alzheimer disease patients (baseline, follow-up, and test/retest studies) and 4 healthy controls, that is, a total of 26 individual scans. The second principal-component images, which illustrate the kinetic behavior of the tracer in gray matter of the cerebellar cortex, were used as input data for automatic delineation of the reference region. To study the variation associated with the manual and proposed automatic methods, we defined the reference region repeatedly.

Results: As expected, the automatic method showed no variation whereas the manual method varied significantly on repetition. Furthermore, the automatic method was significantly faster, more robust, and less biased.

Conclusion: The automatic method is helpful in the delineation of the reference region of (11)C-PIB PET studies of the human brain and is much faster and more precise than manual delineation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19223426/
Comparison of 18F-fluoroazomycin-arabinofuranoside and 64Cu-diacetyl-bis(N4-methylthiosemicarbazone) in preclinical models of cancer,"Silvia Valtorta, Sara Belloli, Francesca Sanvito, Valeria Masiello, Giuseppe Di Grigoli, Cristina Monterisi, Ferruccio Fazio, Maria Picchio, Rosa Maria Moresco","Hypoxic regions are present in different types of cancer and are a negative prognostic factor for disease progression and response to therapy. (18)F-fluoroazomycin-arabinofuranoside ((18)F-FAZA) and (64)Cu-diacetyl-bis(N4-methylthiosemicarbazone) ((64)Cu-ATSM) have been widely used to visualize hypoxic regions in preclinical and clinical studies. Although both these radioligands have high signal-to-noise ratios, (64)Cu-ATSM may be suitable for use in in vivo imaging and as a radiotherapeutic agent. Despite encouraging results suggesting that it may have a role as a prognostic tracer, (64)Cu-ATSM was recently shown to display cell line-dependent kinetics of oxygen-dependent uptake. We set out to evaluate the kinetics of (64)Cu-ATSM distribution in different cancer models, using (18)F-FAZA as the gold standard.

Methods: (18)F-FAZA and (64)Cu-ATSM uptake were compared ex vivo using dual-tracer autoradiography and in vivo using PET in different xenograft mouse models (FaDu, EMT-6, and PC-3). (18)F-FAZA uptake was compared with (64)Cu-ATSM uptake in PET studies acquired at early (2 h after injection) and delayed time points (24 h after injection). To evaluate the presence of hypoxia and copper pumps, the tumors from animals submitted to PET were harvested and analyzed by an immunohistochemical technique, using antibodies against carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) and copper pumps (Ctr1 and ATP7B).

Results: (64)Cu-ATSM showed a higher tumor-to-muscle ratio than did (18)F-FAZA. In the FaDu mouse model, radioactivity distribution profiles were overlapping irrespective of the hypoxic agent injected or the time of (64)Cu acquisition. Conversely, in the EMT-6 and PC-3 models there was little similarity between the early and delayed (64)Cu-ATSM images, and both the radiotracers showed a heterogeneous distribution. The microscopic analysis revealed that (18)F-FAZA-positive areas were also positive for CAIX immunostaining whereas immunolocalization for copper pumps in the 3 models was not related to radioactivity distribution.

Conclusion: The results of this study confirm the cell-dependent distribution and retention kinetics of (64)Cu-ATSM and underline the need for proper validation of animal models and PET acquisition protocols before exploration of any new clinical applications.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23699667/
Using dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging data to constrain a positron emission tomography kinetic model: theory and simulations,"Jacob U Fluckiger, Xia Li, Jennifer G Whisenant, Todd E Peterson, John C Gore, Thomas E Yankeelov","We show how dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) data can constrain a compartmental model for analyzing dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) data. We first develop the theory that enables the use of DCE-MRI data to separate whole tissue time activity curves (TACs) available from dynamic PET data into individual TACs associated with the blood space, the extravascular-extracellular space (EES), and the extravascular-intracellular space (EIS). Then we simulate whole tissue TACs over a range of physiologically relevant kinetic parameter values and show that using appropriate DCE-MRI data can separate the PET TAC into the three components with accuracy that is noise dependent. The simulations show that accurate blood, EES, and EIS TACs can be obtained as evidenced by concordance correlation coefficients >0.9 between the true and estimated TACs. Additionally, provided that the estimated DCE-MRI parameters are within 10% of their true values, the errors in the PET kinetic parameters are within approximately 20% of their true values. The parameters returned by this approach may provide new information on the transport of a tracer in a variety of dynamic PET studies.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24222761/

This study developed a novel tracer via the deuteration of [18F]LW223 and evaluated its in vivo stability and specific binding in neuroinflammatory rodent models and nonhuman primate (NHP) brains. Compared with LW223, D2-LW223 exhibited improved binding affinity to TSPO. Compared with [18F]LW223, [18F]D2-LW223 has superior physicochemical properties and favorable brain kinetics, with enhanced metabolic stability and reduced defluorination. Preclinical investigations in rodent models of LPS-induced neuroinflammation and cerebral ischemia revealed specific [18F]D2-LW223 binding to TSPO in regions affected by neuroinflammation. Two-tissue compartment model analyses provided excellent model fits and allowed the quantitative mapping of TSPO across the NHP brain.

Impact of motion and partial volume effects correction on PET myocardial perfusion imaging using simultaneous PET-MR,"Yoann Petibon, Nicolas J Guehl, Timothy G Reese, Behzad Ebrahimi, Marc D Normandin, Timothy M Shoup, Nathaniel M Alpert, Georges El Fakhri, Jinsong Ouyang","PET is an established modality for myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) which enables quantification of absolute myocardial blood flow (MBF) using dynamic imaging and kinetic modeling. However, heart motion and partial volume effects (PVE) significantly limit the spatial resolution and quantitative accuracy of PET MPI. Simultaneous PET-MR offers a solution to the motion problem in PET by enabling MR-based motion correction of PET data. The aim of this study was to develop a motion and PVE correction methodology for PET MPI using simultaneous PET-MR, and to assess its impact on both static and dynamic PET MPI using18F-Flurpiridaz, a novel18F-labeled perfusion tracer. Two dynamic18F-Flurpiridaz MPI scans were performed on healthy pigs using a PET-MR scanner. Cardiac motion was tracked using a dedicated tagged-MRI (tMR) sequence. Motion fields were estimated using non-rigid registration of tMR images and used to calculate motion-dependent attenuation maps. Motion correction of PET data was achieved by incorporating tMR-based motion fields and motion-dependent attenuation coefficients into image reconstruction. Dynamic and static PET datasets were created for each scan. Each dataset was reconstructed as (i) Ungated, (ii) Gated (end-diastolic phase), and (iii) Motion-Corrected (MoCo), each without and with point spread function (PSF) modeling for PVE correction. Myocardium-to-blood concentration ratios (MBR) and apparent wall thickness were calculated to assess image quality for static MPI. For dynamic MPI, segment- and voxel-wise MBF values were estimated by non-linear fitting of a 2-tissue compartment model to tissue time-activity-curves. MoCo and Gating respectively decreased mean apparent wall thickness by 15.1% and 14.4% and increased MBR by 20.3% and 13.6% compared to Ungated images (P < 0.01). Combined motion and PSF correction (MoCo-PSF) yielded 30.9% (15.7%) lower wall thickness and 82.2% (20.5%) higher MBR compared to Ungated data reconstructed without (with) PSF modeling (P < 0.01). For dynamic PET, mean MBF across all segments were comparable for MoCo (0.72 ± 0.21 ml/min/ml) and Gating (0.69 ± 0.18 ml/min/ml). Ungated data yielded significantly lower mean MBF (0.59 ± 0.16 ml/min/ml). Mean MBF for MoCo-PSF was 0.80 ± 0.22 ml/min/ml, which was 37.9% (25.0%) higher than that obtained from Ungated data without (with) PSF correction (P < 0.01). The developed methodology holds promise to improve the image quality and sensitivity of PET MPI studies performed using PET-MR.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27997375/

Many drugs, such as metoclopramide, are weak ABCB1 substrates and distribute into the brain even when ABCB1 is fully functional. In this study, we used kinetic modeling and validated simplified methods to highlight and quantify the impact of ABCB1 on the BBB influx and efflux of11C-metoclopramide, as a model of a weak ABCB1 substrate, in nonhuman primates.Methods:The regional brain kinetics of a tracer dose of11C-metoclopramide (298 ± 44 MBq) were assessed in baboons using PET without (n= 4) or with (n= 4) intravenous coinfusion of the ABCB1 inhibitor tariquidar (4 mg/kg/h). Metabolite-corrected arterial input functions were generated to estimate the regional volume of distribution (VT), as well as the influx (K1) and efflux (k2) rate constants, using a 1-tissue-compartment model. Modeling outcome parameters were correlated with image-derived parameters, that is, areas under the regional time-activity curves (AUCs) from 0 to 30 min and from 30 to 60 min (SUV⋅min) and the elimination slope (kE; min-1) from 30 to 60 min.Results:Tariquidar significantly increased the brain distribution of11C-metoclopramide (VT= 4.3 ± 0.5 mL/cm3and 8.7 ± 0.5 mL/cm3for baseline and ABCB1 inhibition conditions, respectively,P< 0.001), with a 1.28-fold increase inK1(P< 0.05) and a 1.64-fold decrease ink2(P< 0.001). The effect of tariquidar was homogeneous across different brain regions. The parameters most sensitive to ABCB1 inhibition wereVT(2.02-fold increase) and AUC from 30 to 60 min (2.02-fold increase).VTcorrelated significantly (P< 0.0001) with AUC from 30 to 60 min (r2= 0.95), with AUC from 0 to 30 min (r2= 0.87), and withkE(r2= 0.62).Conclusion:11C-metoclopramide PET imaging revealed the relative importance of both the influx hindrance and the efflux enhancement components of ABCB1 in a relevant model of the human BBB. The overall impact of ABCB1 on drug delivery to the brain can be noninvasively estimated from image-derived outcome parameters without the need for an arterial input function.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29748235/
Lung cancer: reproducibility of quantitative measurements for evaluating 2-[F-18]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose uptake at PET,"H Minn, K R Zasadny, L E Quint, R L Wahl","Purpose: To study the precision of repeated 2-[fluorine-18]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) uptake measurements at positron emission tomography (PET) in patients with primary lung cancer.

Materials and methods: Ten patients with untreated lung cancer underwent two dynamic FDG PET examinations after a 4-hour fast within 1 week. Kinetic modeling of tumor FDG uptake was performed on the basis of a three-compartment model. The tumor concentration of F-18 (standardized uptake value calculated on the basis of predicted lean body mass [SUV-lean]) was also measured 50-60 minutes after injection of a tracer. Blood glucose, insulin, and free fatty acid levels were monitored.

Results: SUV-lean and the FDG influx constant Ki were measured with a mean +/- standard deviation difference of 10% +/- 7 and 10% +/- 8, respectively, over repeated PET scans. The mean difference was reduced to 6% +/- 6 and 6% +/- 5 by multiplying SUV-lean and Ki by plasma glucose concentration.

Conclusion: SUV-lean and graphical Ki can be measured reproducibly, supporting their use in quantitative FDG PET algorithms.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7784562/
Glioma proliferation as assessed by 3'-fluoro-3'-deoxy-L-thymidine positron emission tomography in patients with newly diagnosed high-grade glioma,"Roland Ullrich, Heiko Backes, Hongfeng Li, Lutz Kracht, Hrvoje Miletic, Kristina Kesper, Bernd Neumaier, Wolf-Dieter Heiss, Klaus Wienhard, Andreas H Jacobs","Purpose: The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between the in vivo derived kinetic parameters of 3'-deoxy-3'-(18)F-fluorothymidine ((18)F-FLT) and the proliferation rate measured in vitro by Ki-67 staining in patients with newly diagnosed high-grade gliomas.

Experimental design: Thirteen patients with newly diagnosed high-grade gliomas were investigated with (18)F-FLT and methyl-(11)C- l-methionine ((11)C-MET) positron emission tomography (PET) and T1-, Gd-T1-, and T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging on consecutive days. Tracer kinetic parameters of (18)F-FLT as well as the standardized uptake value and the tumor-to-background (T/B) ratio of (18)F-FLT and (11)C-MET were determined. Data of kinetic modeling, standardized uptake value, and T/B values derived from (18)F-FLT-PET were compared with T/B values derived from (11)C-MET-PET and to the in vitro proliferation marker Ki-67.

Results: A significant correlation was observed between the metabolic rate constant Ki and the proliferation index as measured by Ki-67 immunostaining [Ki, r=0.79 (P=0.004)]. Also, the phosphorylation rate constant k3 correlated with Ki-67 [k3, r=0.76 (P=0.006)], whereas the rate constant for transport through the blood brain barrier K1 showed a weaker correlation with Ki-67 [K1, r=0.62 (P=0.044)]. No significant correlation between (11)C-MET and (18)F-FLT uptake ratios and Ki-67 was observed.

Conclusions: This study shows that kinetic analysis of (18)F-FLT tracer uptake is essential for the in vivo assessment of tumor proliferation in high-grade gliomas, whereas uptake ratios of (11)C-MET and (18)F-FLT failed to correlate with the in vitro determined proliferation marker. Thus, kinetic analysis of (18)F-FLT might provide an accurate method for the assessment of early response to glioma treatment in the future.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18381944/
Quantification of regional myocardial perfusion with generator-produced 62Cu-PTSM and positron emission tomography,"P Herrero, J Markham, C J Weinheimer, C J Anderson, M J Welch, M A Green, S R Bergmann","Background: Noninvasive assessment of regional myocardial perfusion at rest and after stress is important for the objective evaluation of the effects of coronary artery disease and its response to therapy. Centers that do not have cyclotrons rely on generator-produced radioisotopes for assessment of regional myocardial perfusion with positron emission tomography (PET). The aim of the present study was to develop and implement an approach to quantify regional myocardial perfusion using copper(II) pyruvaldehyde bis-(N4-thiosemicarbazone) (PTSM) labeled with the generator-produced, positron-emitting radionuclide 62Cu (t1/2 = 9.7 minutes).

Methods and results: Regional perfusion was estimated from dynamic PET scans after intravenous administration of 62Cu-PTSM in 21 studies in 13 intact dogs evaluated over a wide range of myocardial flow values. In 15 interventions in nine dogs, regional perfusion was also estimated with H2(15)O. Regional perfusion with 62Cu-PTSM was estimated from dynamic blood and tissue time-activity curves, along with the model parameter k1 (forward rate of transport) and the PET parameter FBM (fraction of blood pool activity observed in tissue), using a two-compartment kinetic model. Arterial blood activity was corrected for red blood cell-associated 62Cu. In 44 comparisons, estimates of regional perfusion with 62Cu-PTSM correlated well with estimates obtained with concomitantly administered radiolabeled microspheres (y = 0.90x +/- 0.15, r = 0.95, p < 0.05) over a flow range from 0.23 to 6.14 ml/g per minute. In five healthy human volunteers evaluated at rest with H2(15)O and 62Cu-PTSM, regional perfusion estimated with 62Cu-PTSM was not significantly different from that obtained with H2(15)O (1.05 +/- 0.36 versus 0.96 +/- 0.28 ml/g per minute). 62Cu-PTSM provided high-quality images of the heart.

Conclusions: The results of this study demonstrate that quantification of regional myocardial perfusion is feasible using generator-produced 62Cu-PTSM. Since 62Cu-PTSM can be used to estimate perfusion in the brain, kidney, and tumors as well as in the heart, it is an attractive tracer for centers that rely on generator-produced tracers for the evaluation of perfusion with PET.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8419005/
Quantification of regional ventilation-perfusion ratios with PET,"Marcos F Vidal Melo, Dominick Layfield, R Scott Harris, Kevin O'Neill, Guido Musch, Torsten Richter, Tilo Winkler, Alan J Fischman, Jose G Venegas","The topographic matching of alveolar ventilation (V(A)) and perfusion (Q) is the main determinant of gas exchange efficiency of the lung. However, no pulmonary functional imaging technique has been shown to predict whole-lung gas exchange in health and disease. This study aims to present a PET-based method to estimate regional alveolar ventilation-to-perfusion ratios (V(A)/Q) predictive of arterial blood gases.

Methods: The method is based on the regional tracer kinetics of (13)N-nitrogen ((13)NN) after an intravenous bolus injection during a breath-hold period and subsequent washout from the lungs with resumption of breathing. The method takes into account the presence of inter- and intraregional nonuniformities at length scales smaller than the imaging spatial resolution. An algorithm used regional tracer washout to classify regional V(A)Q/ uniformity. Intraregional V(A)/Q mismatch in nonuniform regions was described with a 2-compartment model. Regional V(A)/Q estimates were combined into a whole-lung distribution of V(A)/Q ratios and were used to compute global arterial blood gases. The method was applied to 3-dimensional PET data from anesthetized and mechanically ventilated sheep before and after methacholine bronchoconstriction (n = 3) and pulmonary embolism (n = 3) and after saline lung lavage (n = 3).

Results: PET images revealed regional changes in ventilation and perfusion consistent with the different disease models. Quantification of the images using PET-derived V(A)Q/ distributions showed unimodal and narrow distributions in control conditions that became wider and unimodal after pulmonary embolism and saline lung lavage and bimodal after bronchoconstriction. Images of regional gas exchange allowed for visualization of regional gas exchange. Arterial blood gases estimated from the PET-based V(A)/Q distributions closely agreed with measured values (partial pressure of oxygen, arterial [PaO(2)]: r(2) = 0.97, P < 0.001; partial pressure of carbon dioxide, arterial [PaCO(2)]: r(2) = 0.96, P < 0.001).

Conclusion: Tracer kinetics analysis of PET images after an intravenous injection of (13)NN provides a quantitative assessment of regional V(A)/Q heterogeneity including that corresponding to length scales smaller than the spatial resolution of the imaging method. Quantification of V(A)/Q mismatch obtained with the presented technique is directly related to severity of gas exchange impairment as determined by arterial blood gases.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14660725/
Functional FDG-PET: Measurement of Task Related Neural Activity in Humans-A Compartment Model Approach and Comparison to fMRI,"Saga Steinmann Madsen, Svend Hvidsten, Thomas Lund Andersen","Neuroimaging holds an essential position in global healthcare, as brain-related disorders are a substantial and growing burden. Non-degenerative disorders such as stress, depression and anxiety share common function related traits of diffuse and fluctuating changes, such as change in brain-based functions of mood, behavior and cognitive abilities, where underlying physiological mechanism remain unresolved. In this study we developed a novel application for studying intra-subject task-activated brain function by the quantitative physiological measurement of the change in glucose metabolism in a single scan setup. Data were acquired on a PET/MR-scanner. We implemented a functional [18F]-FDG PET-scan with double boli-tracer administration and finger-tapping activation, as proof-of-concept, in five healthy participants. The [18F]-FDG data were analyzed using a two-tissue compartment double boli kinetic model with an image-derived input function. For stand-alone visual reference, blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) functional MRI (fMRI) was acquired in the same session and analyzed separately. We were able to measure the cerebral glucose metabolic rate during baseline as well as activation. Results showed increased glucose metabolic rate during activation by 36.3-87.9% mean 62.0%, locally in the peak seed region of M1 in the brain, on an intra-subject level, as well as very good spatial accuracy on group level, and localization compared to the BOLD fMRI result at subject and group level. Our novel method successfully determined the relative increase in the cerebral metabolic rate of glucose on a voxel level with good visual association to fMRI at the subject-level, holding promise for future individual clinical application. This approach will be easily adapted in future clinical perspectives and pharmacological interventions studies.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37835864/
Bias reduction for low-statistics PET: maximum likelihood reconstruction with a modified Poisson distribution,"Katrien Van Slambrouck, Simon Stute, Claude Comtat, Merence Sibomana, Floris H P van Velden, Ronald Boellaard, Johan Nuyts","Positron emission tomography data are typically reconstructed with maximum likelihood expectation maximization (MLEM). However, MLEM suffers from positive bias due to the non-negativity constraint. This is particularly problematic for tracer kinetic modeling. Two reconstruction methods with bias reduction properties that do not use strict Poisson optimization are presented and compared to each other, to filtered backprojection (FBP), and to MLEM. The first method is an extension of NEGML, where the Poisson distribution is replaced by a Gaussian distribution for low count data points. The transition point between the Gaussian and the Poisson regime is a parameter of the model. The second method is a simplification of ABML. ABML has a lower and upper bound for the reconstructed image whereas AML has the upper bound set to infinity. AML uses a negative lower bound to obtain bias reduction properties. Different choices of the lower bound are studied. The parameter of both algorithms determines the effectiveness of the bias reduction and should be chosen large enough to ensure bias-free images. This means that both algorithms become more similar to least squares algorithms, which turned out to be necessary to obtain bias-free reconstructions. This comes at the cost of increased variance. Nevertheless, NEGML and AML have lower variance than FBP. Furthermore, randoms handling has a large influence on the bias. Reconstruction with smoothed randoms results in lower bias compared to reconstruction with unsmoothed randoms or randoms precorrected data. However, NEGML and AML yield both bias-free images for large values of their parameter.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25137726/
Quantitative PET imaging of tumor integrin alphavbeta3 expression with 18F-FRGD2,"Xianzhong Zhang, Zhengming Xiong, Yun Wu, Weibo Cai, Jeffery R Tseng, Sanjiv S Gambhir, Xiaoyuan Chen","The development of noninvasive methods to visualize and quantify integrin alpha(v)beta(3) expression in vivo appears to be crucial for the success of antiangiogenic therapy based on integrin antagonism. Precise documentation of integrin receptor levels will allow appropriate selection of patients who will most likely benefit from an antiintegrin treatment regimen. Imaging can also be used to provide an optimal dosage and time course for treatment based on receptor occupancy studies. In addition, imaging integrin expression will be important to evaluate antiintegrin treatment efficacy and to develop new therapeutic drugs with favorable tumor targeting and in vivo kinetics. We labeled the dimeric RGD peptide E[c(RGDyK)](2) with (18)F and evaluated its tumor-targeting efficacy and pharmacokinetics of (18)F-FB-E[c(RGDyK)](2) ((18)F-FRGD2).

Methods: E[c(RGDyK)](2) was labeled with (18)F by conjugation coupling with N-succinimidyl-4-(18)F-fluorobenzoate ((18)F-SFB) under a slightly basic condition. The in vivo metabolic stability of (18)F-FRGD2 was determined. The diagnostic value after injection of (18)F-FRGD2 was evaluated in various xenograft models by dynamic microPET followed by ex vivo quantification of tumor integrin level.

Results: Starting with (18)F(-) Kryptofix 2.2.2./K(2)CO(3) solution, the total reaction time for (18)F-FRGD2, including final high-performance liquid chromatography purification, is about 200 +/- 20 min. Typical decay-corrected radiochemical yield is 23% +/- 2% (n = 20). (18)F-FRGD2 is metabolically stable. The binding potential extrapolated from graphical analysis of PET data and Logan plot correlates well with the receptor density measured by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide electrophoresis and autoradiography in various xenograft models. The tumor-to-background ratio at 1 h after injection of (18)F-FRGD2 also gives a good linear relationship with the tumor tissue integrin level.

Conclusion: The dimeric RGD peptide tracer (18)F-FRGD2, with high integrin specificity and favorable excretion profile, may be translated into the clinic for imaging integrin alpha(v)beta(3) expression. The binding potential calculated from simplified tracer kinetic modeling such as the Logan plot appears to be an excellent indicator of tumor integrin density.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16391195/
Limited view PET reconstruction of tissue radioactivity maps,"Yunxia Shen, Huafeng Liu, Pengcheng Shi","This paper proposes a state space method for limited view PET reconstruction. Due to the high-level of noise and data-incompletion, prior knowledge is required to guide PET recovery. The compartmental model is used as an evolution equation to regularize the dynamic reconstruction. The continuous-discrete Kalman filter is adopted to calculate the radioactivity value recursively. With tracer kinetic information as prior, the state space approach can obtain a better result compared with the MLEM algorithm. The identifiability of this method is proved by computer synthetic simulation and real phantom experiment on the Hamamatsu SHR-22000PET scanner.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19726159/
MicroPET-based pharmacokinetic analysis of the radiolabeled boron compound [18F]FBPA-F in rats with F98 glioma,"J C Chen, S M Chang, F Y Hsu, H E Wang, R S Liu",Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) is one of the effective methods of radiation therapy for the treatment of tumors such as malignant glioma. Boronophenylalanine ((10)B-BPA) solution has been used as a potential boron carrier for such a treatment. The aim of this study is to investigate 4-borono-2-[(18)F]-fluoro-l-phenylalanine-fructose ([(18)F]FBPA-F) in rats injected in the brain with glioma using in vivo small animal positron emission tomography (PET) imaging (microPET). Male Fischer 344 rats with F98 glioma in the left brain were used for these studies. Dynamic PET imaging of [(18)F]FBPA-F was performed on the 13th day after tumor inoculation. Arterial blood sampling was performed to obtain an input function for tracer kinetic modeling. The accumulation ratios of [(18)F]FBPA-F for the glioma-to-normal brain approached 3. The uptake characteristics of BPA-F and [(18)F]FBPA-F were similar. The results indicate that 4h after BPA-F injection would be the optimal irradiation time for BNCT. Rate constants were estimated using a three-compartment model. This study provides useful information for the clinical application of BNCT in patients with brain tumors.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15308163/
Quantitative PET of liver functions,"Susanne Keiding, Michael Sørensen, Kim Frisch, Lars C Gormsen, Ole Lajord Munk","Improved understanding of liver physiology and pathophysiology is urgently needed to assist the choice of new and upcoming therapeutic modalities for patients with liver diseases. In this review, we focus on functional PET of the liver: 1) Dynamic PET with 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-galactose (18F-FDGal) provides quantitative images of the hepatic metabolic clearanceKmet(mL blood/min/mL liver tissue) of regional and whole-liver hepatic metabolic function. Standard-uptake-value (SUV) from a static liver18F-FDGal PET/CT scan can replaceKmetand is currently used clinically. 2) Dynamic liver PET/CT in humans with11C-palmitate and with the conjugated bile acid tracer [N-methyl-11C]cholylsarcosine (11C-CSar) can distinguish between individual intrahepatic transport steps in hepatic lipid metabolism and in hepatic transport of bile acid from blood to bile, respectively, showing diagnostic potential for individual patients. 3) Standard compartment analysis of dynamic PET data can lead to physiological inconsistencies, such as a unidirectional hepatic clearance of tracer from blood (K1; mL blood/min/mL liver tissue) greater than the hepatic blood perfusion. We developed a new microvascular compartment model with more physiology, by including tracer uptake into the hepatocytes from the blood flowing through the sinusoids, backflux from hepatocytes into the sinusoidal blood, and re-uptake along the sinusoidal path. Dynamic PET data include information on liver physiology which cannot be extracted using a standard compartment model.In conclusion,SUVof non-invasive static PET with18F-FDGal provides a clinically useful measurement of regional and whole-liver hepatic metabolic function. Secondly, assessment of individual intrahepatic transport steps is a notable feature of dynamic liver PET.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29755841/
68Ga-labeled bombesin studies in patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors: comparison with 18F-FDG,"Antonia Dimitrakopoulou-Strauss, Peter Hohenberger, Uwe Haberkorn, Helmut R Mäcke, Michael Eisenhut, Ludwig G Strauss","Dynamic PET studies with a 68Ga-bombesin analog, DOTA-PEG2-[d-Tyr6, beta-Ala11,Thi13,Nle14] BN(6-14) amide (68Ga-BZH3; DOTA is 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-N,N',N'',N'''-tetraacetic acid, and PEG is ethylene glycol [2-aminoethyl-carboxymethyl ether]), were performed on patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) to investigate the impact of complementary receptor scintigraphy on diagnosis and the potential of a radionuclide treatment. Furthermore, dynamic 18F-FDG studies were performed on the same patients.

Methods: This study comprised 17 patients with GIST. All patients were scheduled for therapy with imatinib because of unresectable primary or recurrent GIST or because of metastatic disease. Dynamic PET scans using 68Ga-BZH3 and 18F-FDG were obtained on 2 consecutive days. Multivariate analysis was used to evaluate the kinetic data. Standardized uptake values (SUVs) were calculated, and a compartmental model (2-tissue) and noncompartmental model were used for data evaluation of both tracers.

Results: Fourteen of 17 patients (25/30 lesions) were positive for uptake on 18F-FDG imaging, whereas 68Ga-BZH3 demonstrated an enhanced accumulation in 7 of 17 patients (8/30 lesions). Thirteen lesions were confirmed by histologic examination, and the remaining 17 were confirmed by follow-up. One recurrent tumor in the stomach could not be delineated on 18F-FDG imaging but showed enhanced 68Ga-BZH3 uptake. The median SUV for 68Ga-BZH3 was 3.3, in comparison with 7.9 for 18F-FDG. Best-subset analysis demonstrated that the global SUV (55-60 min after injection) for 18F-FDG was primarily dependent on k3, followed by k1. Multivariate analysis did not show a significant correlation between the kinetic parameters (k1-k4, fractional blood volume, and SUV) for 18F-FDG and bombesin.

Conclusion: 68Ga-BZH3 may be helpful for diagnostic reasons in a subgroup of patients with GIST, as in the case of negative 18F-FDG findings and suspicion of viable tumor tissue. The meaning of the enhanced 68Ga-BZH3 uptake is open at the moment.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17631559/
18F-flumazenil: a γ-aminobutyric acid A-specific PET radiotracer for the localization of drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy,"Lucy Vivash, Marie-Claude Gregoire, Eddie W Lau, Robert E Ware, David Binns, Peter Roselt, Viviane Bouilleret, Damian E Myers, Mark J Cook, Rodney J Hicks, Terence J O'Brien","Studies report that (11)C-flumazenil (FMZ) PET more specifically localizes the epileptogenic zone in patients with medically refractory focal epilepsy than (18)F-FDG PET. However, practical aspects of (11)C use limit clinical application. We report a phase I/IIa study assessing the clinical use of (18)F-FMZ PET for the localization of the epileptogenic zone in patients with drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Receptor binding was quantified using kinetic modeling that did not require arterial sampling.

Methods: Dynamic (18)F-FMZ PET and static interictal (18)F-FDG PET scans were compared in healthy controls (n = 17 for (18)F-FMZ and n = 20 for (18)F-FDG) and TLE patients with mesial temporal sclerosis on MR imaging (MTS, n = 12) and with normal MR imaging (NL TLE, n = 19). Masked visual assessment of images was undertaken. Parametric images of (18)F-FMZ binding potential (BPND) were generated using the simplified reference tissue model. Region-of-interest analysis on coregistered MR images and statistical parametric mapping were used to quantify (18)F-FMZ BPND and (18)F-FDG uptake in the temporal lobe.

Results: The visual assessment of static standardized uptake value images showed (18)F-FMZ PET to have high specificity (16/17 [94%]) and moderate sensitivity (21/31 [68%]) for the localization of the epileptogenic zone, with a more restricted abnormality than (18)F-FDG PET. However, the (18)F-FMZ standardized uptake value images were falsely localizing in 3 of 31 patients (10%). Region-of-interest analysis demonstrated reductions in ipsilateral hippocampal (18)F-FMZ BPND in patients with either MTS or NL TLE, compared with controls subjects. Ipsilateral hippocampal (18)F-FMZ BPND was independent of both hippocampal volume and (18)F-FDG uptake, whereas ipsilateral hippocampal volume was correlated with (18)F-FDG uptake (r(2) = 0.69, P < 0.0001). Statistical parametric mapping analysis demonstrated decreased uptake in 14 of 31 (45%) cases with (18)F-FMZ PET and 18 of 29 (62%) with (18)F-FDG PET. Cluster size was significantly smaller on (18)F-FMZ than (18)F-FDG images (37 vs. 160 voxels, P < 0.01).

Conclusion: (18)F-FMZ PET has potential as a clinical tool for the localization of the epileptogenic zone in the presurgical evaluation of drug-resistant TLE, providing information complementary to (18)F-FDG PET, with a more restricted region of abnormality.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23857513/
PET/CT studies of multiple myeloma using (18) F-FDG and (18) F-NaF: comparison of distribution patterns and tracers' pharmacokinetics,"Christos Sachpekidis, Hartmut Goldschmidt, Dirk Hose, Leyun Pan, Caixia Cheng, Klaus Kopka, Uwe Haberkorn, Antonia Dimitrakopoulou-Strauss","Objective: The aim of this prospective study is to evaluate the combined use of fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose ((18) F-FDG) and fluorine-18 sodium fluoride ((18) F-NaF) PET/CT in the skeletal assessment of patients with multiple myeloma (MM) and to compare the efficacy of these two PET tracers regarding detection of myeloma-indicative osseous lesions.

Patients and methods: The study includes 60 patients with multiple myeloma (MM) diagnosed according to standard criteria. All patients underwent dynamic (dPET/CT) scanning of the pelvis as well as whole body PET/CT studies with both tracers. The interval between the two exams was one day. Sites of focal increased (18) F-FDG uptake were considered as highly suspicious of myelomatous involvement. The lesions detected on the (18) F-NaF PET/CT scans were then correlated with those detected on (18) F-FDG PET/CT, which served as a reference. Moreover, the (18) F-FDG PET/CT results were also correlated with the low-dose CT findings. The evaluation of dPET/CT studies was based on qualitative evaluation, SUV calculation, and quantitative analysis based on a 2-tissue compartment model and a non-compartmental approach.

Results: Whole body (18) F-FDG PET/CT revealed approximately 343 focal lesions while (18) F-NaF PET/CT revealed 135 MM-indicative lesions (39 % correlation). CT demonstrated 150 lesions that correlated with those in (18) F-FDG PET/CT (44 % correlation). Six patients demonstrated a diffuse pattern of disease with (18) F-FDG, while 15 of them had a mixed (diffuse and focal) pattern of skeletal (18) F-FDG uptake. A high number of degenerative, traumatic and arthritic disease lesions were detected with (18) F-NaF PET/CT. In three patients with multiple focal (18) F-FDG-uptake, (18) F-NaF PET/CT failed to demonstrate any bone lesion. The dPET/CT scanning of the pelvic area with (18) F-FDG and (18) F-NaF revealed 77 and 24 MM-indicative lesions, respectively. Kinetic analysis of (18) F-FDG revealed the following mean values: SUVaver = 5.1, k1 = 0.37 (1/min), k3 = 0.10 (1/min), VB = 0.06, influx = 0.04 (1/min), FD = 1.28; the respective values for (18) F-NaF were SUVaverage = 10.7, k1 = 0.25 (1/min), k3 = 0.34 (1/min), VB = 0.02, influx = 0.10 (1/min), FD = 1.37. Apart from the correlation between VB of (18) F-FDG and k1 of (18) F-NaF (r = 0.54), no other significant correlation was observed between the two tracers' kinetic parameters. We found a significant correlation between FD and SUVaverage (r = 0.93), FD and SUVmax (r = 0.80), FD and influx ( r = 0.85), as well as between influx and SUVaverage (r = 0.74) for (18) F-FDG. In (18) F-NaF we observed the most significant correlations between FD and SUVaverage (r = 0.97), FD and SUVmax (r = 0.87), and between influx and k1 (r = 0.72).

Conclusion: The combined use of (18) F-FDG PET/CT and (18) F-NaF PET/CT provides different molecular information regarding the biological processes that take place in a MM osseous lesion. (18) F-FDG PET/CT proved to be a more specific biomarker than (18) F-NaF PET/CT in multiple myeloma skeletal assessment.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24562650/
Masked volume wise Principal Component Analysis of small adrenocortical tumours in dynamic [11C]-metomidate Positron Emission Tomography,"Pasha Razifar, Joakim Hennings, Azita Monazzam, Per Hellman, Bengt Långström, Anders Sundin","Background: In previous clinical Positron Emission Tomography (PET) studies novel approaches for application of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on dynamic PET images such as Masked Volume Wise PCA (MVW-PCA) have been introduced. MVW-PCA was shown to be a feasible multivariate analysis technique, which, without modeling assumptions, could extract and separate organs and tissues with different kinetic behaviors into different principal components (MVW-PCs) and improve the image quality.

Methods: In this study, MVW-PCA was applied to 14 dynamic 11C-metomidate-PET (MTO-PET) examinations of 7 patients with small adrenocortical tumours. MTO-PET was performed before and 3 days after starting per oral cortisone treatment. The whole dataset, reconstructed by filtered back projection (FBP) 0-45 minutes after the tracer injection, was used to study the tracer pharmacokinetics.

Results: Early, intermediate and late pharmacokinetic phases could be isolated in this manner. The MVW-PC1 images correlated well to the conventionally summed image data (15-45 minutes) but the image noise in the former was considerably lower. PET measurements performed by defining ""hot spot"" regions of interest (ROIs) comprising 4 contiguous pixels with the highest radioactivity concentration showed a trend towards higher SUVs when the ROIs were outlined in the MVW-PC1 component than in the summed images. Time activity curves derived from ""50% cut-off"" ROIs based on an isocontour function whereby the pixels with SUVs between 50 to 100% of the highest radioactivity concentration were delineated, showed a significant decrease of the SUVs in normal adrenal glands and in adrenocortical adenomas after cortisone treatment.

Conclusion: In addition to the clear decrease in image noise and the improved contrast between different structures with MVW-PCA, the results indicate that the definition of ROIs may be more accurate and precise in MVW-PC1 images than in conventional summed images. This might improve the precision of PET measurements, for instance in therapy monitoring as well as for delineation of the tumour in radiation therapy planning.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19386097/
Validation of the reference tissue model for estimation of dopaminergic D2-like receptor binding with [18F](N-methyl)benperidol in humans,"Jo Ann V Antenor-Dorsey, Joanne Markham, Stephen M Moerlein, Tom O Videen, Joel S Perlmutter","Positron emission tomography measurements of dopaminergic D2-like receptors may provide important insights into disorders such as Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, dystonia and Tourette's syndrome. The positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand [18F](N-methyl)benperidol ([18F]NMB) has high affinity and selectivity for D2-like receptors and is not displaced by endogenous dopamine. The goal of this study is to evaluate the use of a graphical method utilizing a reference tissue region for [18F]-NMB PET analysis by comparisons to an explicit three-compartment tracer kinetic model and graphical method that use arterial blood measurements. We estimated binding potential (BP) in the caudate and putamen using all three methods in 16 humans and found that the three-compartment tracer kinetic method provided the highest BP estimates while the graphical method using a reference region yielded the lowest estimates (P<.0001 by repeated-measures ANOVA). However, the three methods yielded highly correlated BP estimates for the two regions of interest. We conclude that the graphical method using a reference region still provides a useful estimate of BP comparable to methods using arterial blood sampling, especially since the reference region method is less invasive and computationally more straightforward, thereby simplifying these measurements.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18355689/
In Vivo Induction of P-Glycoprotein Function can be Measured with [18F]MC225 and PET,"Lara García-Varela, Manuel Rodríguez-Pérez, Antía Custodia, Rodrigo Moraga-Amaro, Nicola A Colabufo, Pablo Aguiar, Tomás Sobrino, Rudi A J O Dierckx, Aren van Waarde, Philip H Elsinga, Gert Luurtsema","P-Glycoprotein (P-gp) is an efflux pump located at the blood-brain barrier (BBB) that contributes to the protection of the central nervous system by transporting neurotoxic compounds out of the brain. A decline in P-gp function has been related to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. P-gp inducers can increase the P-gp function and are considered as potential candidates for the treatment of such disorders. The P-gp inducer MC111 increased P-gp expression and function in SW480 human colon adenocarcinoma and colo-320 cells, respectively. Our study aims to evaluate the P-gp inducing effect of MC111 in the whole brainin vivo, using the P-gp tracer [18F]MC225 and positron emission tomography (PET). Eighteen Wistar rats were treated with either vehicle solution, 4.5 mg/kg of MC111 (low-dose group), or 6 mg/kg of MC111 (high-dose group). Animals underwent a 60 min dynamic PET scan with arterial-blood sampling, 24 h after treatment with the inducer. Data were analyzed using the 1-tissue-compartment model and metabolite-corrected plasma as the input function. Model parameters such as the influx constant (K1) and volume of distribution (VT) were calculated, which reflect thein vivoP-gp function. P-gp and pregnane xenobiotic receptor (PXR) expression levels of the whole brain were assessed using western blot. The administration of MC111 decreasedK1andVTof [18F]MC225 in the whole brain and all of the selected brain regions. In the high-dose group, whole-brainK1was decreased by 34% (K1-high-dose = 0.20 ± 0.02 vsK1-control = 0.30 ± 0.02;p< 0.001) and in the low-dose group by 7% (K1-low-dose = 0.28 ± 0.02 vsK1-control = 0.30 ± 0.02;p= 0.42) compared to controls. Whole-brainVTwas decreased by 25% in the high-dose group (VT-high-dose = 5.92 ± 0.41 vsVT-control = 7.82 ± 0.38;p< 0.001) and by 6% in the low-dose group (VT-low-dose = 7.35 ± 0.38 vsVT-control = 7.82 ± 0.37;p= 0.38) compared to controls.k2values did not vary after treatment. The treatment did not affect the metabolism of [18F]MC225. Western blot studies using the whole-brain tissue did not detect changes in the P-gp expression, however, preliminary results using isolated brain capillaries found an increasing trend up to 37% in treated rats. The decrease inK1andVTvalues after treatment with the inducer indicates an increase in the P-gp functionality at the BBB of treated rats. Moreover, preliminary results using brain endothelial cells also sustained the increase in the P-gp expression. In conclusion, the results verify that MC111 induces P-gp expression and function at the BBB in rats. An increasing trend regarding the P-gp expression levels is found using western blot and an increased P-gp function is confirmed with [18F]MC225 and PET.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34228458/
Framing protocol optimization in oncological Patlak parametric imaging with uKinetics,"Qing Ye, Hao Zeng, Yizhang Zhao, Weiguang Zhang, Yun Dong, Wei Fan, Yihuan Lu","Purpose: Total-body PET imaging with ultra-high sensitivity makes high-temporal-resolution framing protocols possible for the first time, which allows to capture rapid tracer dynamic changes. However, whether protocols with higher number of temporal frames can justify the efficacy with substantially added computation burden for clinical application remains unclear. We have developed a kinetic modeling software package (uKinetics) with the advantage of practical, fast, and automatic workflow for dynamic total-body studies. The aim of this work is to verify the uKinetics with PMOD and to perform framing protocol optimization for the oncological Patlak parametric imaging.

Methods: Six different protocols with 100, 61, 48, 29, 19 and 12 temporal frames were applied to analyze 60-min dynamic18F-FDG PET scans of 10 patients, respectively. Voxel-based Patlak analysis coupled with automatically extracted image-derived input function was applied to generate parametric images. Normal tissues and lesions were segmented manually or automatically to perform correlation analysis and Bland-Altman plots. Different protocols were compared with the protocol of 100 frames as reference.

Results: Minor differences were found between uKinetics and PMOD in the Patlak parametric imaging. Compared with the protocol with 100 frames, the relative difference of the input function and quantitative kinetic parameters remained low for protocols with at least 29 frames, but increased for the protocols with 19 and 12 frames. Significant difference of lesion Kivalues was found between the protocols with 100 frames and 12 frames.

Conclusion: uKinetics was proved providing equivalent oncological Patlak parametric imaging comparing to PMOD. Minor differences were found between protocols with 100 and 29 frames, which indicated that 29-frame protocol is sufficient and efficient for the oncological18F-FDG Patlak applications, and the protocols with more frames are not needed. The protocol with 19 frames yielded acceptable results, while that with 12 frames is not recommended.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37698773/
Evaluation of the Novel PET Tracer [11C]HACH242 for Imaging the GluN2B NMDA Receptor in Non-Human Primates,"Jasper van der Aart, Maqsood Yaqub, Esther J M Kooijman, Jaco Bakker, Jan A M Langermans, Robert C Schuit, Mark B M Hofman, Johannes A M Christiaans, Adriaan A Lammertsma, Albert D Windhorst, Bart N M van Berckel","Purpose: There are currently no positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracers for the GluN2B (NR2B) binding sites of brain N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. In rats, the GluN2B antagonist Ro25-6981 reduced the binding of N-((5-(4-fluoro-2-[11C]methoxyphenyl)pyridin-3-yl)methyl)cyclopentanamin ([11C]HACH242). This paper reports the evaluation of [11C]HACH242 PET in non-human primates at baseline and following administration of the GluN2B negative allosteric modulator radiprodil.

Procedures: Eight 90-min dynamic [11C]HACH242 PET scans were acquired in three male anaesthetised rhesus monkeys, including a retest session of subject 1, at baseline and 10 min after intravenous 10 mg/kg radiprodil. Standardised uptake values (SUV) were calculated for 9 brain regions. Arterial blood samples were taken at six timepoints to characterise pharmacokinetics in blood and plasma. Reliable input functions for kinetic modelling could not be generated due to variability in the whole-blood radioactivity measurements.

Results: [11C]HACH242 entered the brain and displayed fairly uniform uptake. The mean (± standard deviation, SD) Tmaxwas 17 ± 7 min in baseline scans and 24 ± 15 min in radiprodil scans. The rate of radioligand metabolism in plasma (primarily to polar metabolites) was high, with mean parent fractions of 26 ± 10 % at 20 min and 8 ± 5 % at 85 min. Radiprodil increased [11C]HACH242 whole-brain SUV in the last PET frame by 25 %, 1 %, 3 and 17 % for subjects 1, 2, 3 and retest of subject 1, respectively. The mean brain to plasma ratio was 5.4 ± 2.6, and increased by 39 to 110 % in the radiprodil condition, partly due to lower parent plasma radioactivity of -11 to -56 %.

Conclusions: The present results show that [11C]HACH242 has a suitable kinetic profile in the brain and low accumulation of lipophilic radiometabolites. Radiprodil did not consistently change [11C]HACH242 brain uptake. These findings may be explained by variations in cerebral blood flow, a low fraction of specifically bound tracer, or interactions with endogenous NMDA receptor ligands at the binding site. Further experiments of ligand interactions are necessary to facilitate the development of radiotracers for in vivo imaging of the ionotropic NMDA receptor.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30306318/
"PET imaging of 68Ga-NODAGA-RGD, as compared with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose, in experimental rodent models of engrafted glioblastoma","Sibel Isal, Julien Pierson, Laetitia Imbert, Alexandra Clement, Charlotte Collet, Sophie Pinel, Nicolas Veran, Aurélie Reinhard, Sylvain Poussier, Guillaume Gauchotte, Steeven Frezier, Gilles Karcher, Pierre-Yves Marie, Fatiha Maskali","Background: Tracers triggering αvβ3 integrins, such as certain RGD-containing peptides, were found promising in previous pilot studies characterizing high-grade gliomas. However, only limited comparisons have been performed with current PET tracers. This study aimed at comparing the biodistribution of18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) with that of68Ga-NODAGA-RGD, an easily synthesized monomeric RGD compound with rapid kinetics, in two different rodent models of engrafted human glioblastoma.

Methods: Nude rodents bearing human U87-MG glioblastoma tumor xenografts in the flank (34 tumors in mice) or in the brain (5 tumors in rats) were analyzed. Kinetics of68Ga-NODAGA-RGD and of18F-FDG were compared with PET imaging in the same animals, along with additional autohistoradiographic analyses and blocking tests for68Ga-NODAGA-RGD.

Results: Both tracers showed a primary renal route of clearance, although with faster clearance for68Ga-NODAGA-RGD resulting in higher activities in the kidneys and bladder. The tumor activity from68Ga-NODAGA-RGD, likely corresponding to true integrin binding (i.e., suppressed by co-injection of a saturating excess of unlabeled RGD), was found relatively high, but only at the 2ndhour following injection, corresponding on average to 53% of total tumor activity. Tumor uptake of68Ga-NODAGA-RGD decreased progressively with time, contrary to that of18F-FDG, although68Ga-NODAGA-RGD exhibited 3.4 and 3.7-fold higher tumor-to-normal brain ratios on average compared to18F-FDG in mice and rat models, respectively. Finally, ex-vivo analyses revealed that the tumor areas with high68Ga-NODAGA-RGD uptake also exhibited the highest rates of cell proliferation and αv integrin expression, irrespective of cell density.

Conclusions: 68Ga-NODAGA-RGD has a high potential for PET imaging of glioblastomas, especially for areas with high integrin expression and cell proliferation, although PET recording needs to be delayed until the 2ndhour following injection in order to provide sufficiently high integrin specificity.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29904818/
Assessment of cerebral drug occupancy in humans using a single PET-scan: A [11C]UCB-J PET study,"Maja R Marstrand-Joergensen, Gjertrud L Laurell, Susan Herrmann, Arafat Nasser, Annette Johansen, Anton Lund, Thomas L Andersen, Gitte M Knudsen, Lars H Pinborg","Purpose: Here, we evaluate a PET displacement model with a Single-step and Numerical solution in healthy individuals using the synaptic vesicle glycoprotein (SV2A) PET-tracer [11C]UCB-J and the anti-seizure medication levetiracetam (LEV). We aimed to (1) validate the displacement model by comparing the brain LEV-SV2A occupancy from a single PET scan with the occupancy derived from two PET scans and the Lassen plot and (2) determine the plasma LEV concentration-SV2A occupancy curve in healthy individuals.

Methods: Eleven healthy individuals (five females, mean age 35.5 [range: 25-47] years) underwent two 120-min [11C]UCB-J PET scans where an LEV dose (5-30 mg/kg) was administered intravenously halfway through the first PET scan to partially displace radioligand binding to SV2A. Five individuals were scanned twice on the same day; the remaining six were scanned once on two separate days, receiving two identical LEV doses. Arterial blood samples were acquired to determine the arterial input function and plasma LEV concentrations. Using the displacement model, the SV2A-LEV target engagement was calculated and compared with the Lassen plot method. The resulting data were fitted with a single-site binding model.

Results: SV2A occupancies and VNDestimates derived from the displacement model were not significantly different from the Lassen plot (p = 0.55 and 0.13, respectively). The coefficient of variation was 14.6% vs. 17.3% for the Numerical and the Single-step solution in Bland-Altman comparisons with the Lassen plot. The average half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50), as estimated from the area under the curve of the plasma LEV concentration, was 12.5 µg/mL (95% CI: 5-25) for the Single-Step solution, 11.8 µg/mL (95% CI: 4-25) for the Numerical solution, and 6.3 µg/mL (95% CI: 0.08-21) for the Lassen plot. Constraining Emax to 100% did not significantly improve model fits.

Conclusion: Plasma LEV concentration vs. SV2A occupancy can be determined in humans using a single PET scan displacement model. The average concentration of the three computed IC50values ranges between 6.3 and 12.5 µg/mL. The next step is to use the displacement model to evaluate LEV occupancy and corresponding plasma concentrations in relation to treatment efficacy.

[Application of pre-clinical PET imaging for drug development],Hideo Tsukada,"Positron emission tomography (PET) is a sophisticated method for the quantitative and noninvasive imaging of biological functions by monitoring the delivery of tracers labeled with positron emitters (1C, 'aN, '""O, and 8F). The distribution and kinetic patterns of a labeled compound in relation to the specific biomolecule in the target tissue are assumed to reflect specific biological functions in the living body. A wide variety of labeled compounds as molecular probes have been developed to measure biochemical and physiological parameters, such as blood flow, glucose and oxygen metabolism, protein synthesis, and neurotransmitter receptor functions. Recently, PET has gradually been introduced into the research field of drug development both in pre-clinical and clinical stages. In the present chapter, the applications of animal PET with small animals (rats and mice) and non-human primates in drug development in the pre-clinical stage will be discussed based on our own experiences. In the course of drug development, the pre-clinical studies with experimental animals are indispensable, and these studies are expected to provide useful information to facilitate the development of drug candidates with more efficacy and fewer adverse effects in the clinical stage with",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22256612/
Monitoring Tumor Hypoxia Using (18)F-FMISO PET and Pharmacokinetics Modeling after Photodynamic Therapy,"Xiao Tong, Avinash Srivatsan, Orit Jacobson, Yu Wang, Zhantong Wang, Xiangyu Yang, Gang Niu, Dale O Kiesewetter, Hairong Zheng, Xiaoyuan Chen","Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is an efficacious treatment for some types of cancers. However, PDT-induced tumor hypoxia as a result of oxygen consumption and vascular damage can reduce the efficacy of this therapy. Measuring and monitoring intrinsic and PDT-induced tumor hypoxia in vivo during PDT is of high interest for prognostic and treatment evaluation. In the present study, static and dynamic (18)F-FMISO PET were performed with mice bearing either U87MG or MDA-MB-435 tumor xenografts immediately before and after PDT at different time points. Significant difference in tumor hypoxia in response to PDT over time was found between the U87MG and MDA-MB-435 tumors in both static and dynamic PET. Dynamic PET with pharmacokinetics modeling further monitored the kinetics of (18)F-FMISO retention to hypoxic sites after treatment. The Ki and k3 parametric analysis provided information on tumor hypoxia by distinction of the specific tracer retention in hypoxic sites from its non-specific distribution in tumor. Dynamic (18)F-FMISO PET with pharmacokinetics modeling, complementary to static PET analysis, provides a potential imaging tool for more detailed and more accurate quantification of tumor hypoxia during PDT.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27546160/
Positron emission tomography imaging of regional pulmonary perfusion and ventilation,"Guido Musch, Jose G Venegas","Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging is a noninvasive, quantitative method to assess pulmonary perfusion and ventilation in vivo. The core of this article focuses on the use of [13N]nitrogen (13N2) and PET to assess regional gas exchange. Regional perfusion and shunt can be measured with the 13N2-saline bolus infusion technique. A bolus of 13N2, dissolved in saline solution, is injected intravenously at the start of a brief apnea, while the tracer kinetics in the lung is measured by a sequence of PET frames. Because of its low solubility in blood, virtually all 13N2 delivered to aerated lung regions diffuses into the alveolar airspace, where it accumulates in proportion to regional perfusion during the apnea. In contrast, lung regions that are perfused but are not aerated and do not exchange gas (i.e., ""shunting"" units) do not retain 13N2 during apnea and the tracer concentration drops after the initial peak. Accurate estimates of regional perfusion and regional shunt can be derived by applying a mathematical model to the pulmonary kinetics of a 13N2-saline bolus. When breathing is resumed, specific alveolar ventilation can be calculated from the tracer washout rate, because 13N2 is eliminated almost exclusively by ventilation. Because of the rapid elimination of the tracer, 13N2 infusion scans can be followed by 13N2 inhalation scans that allow determination of regional gas fraction. This article describes insights into the pathophysiology of acute lung injury, pulmonary embolism, and asthma that have been gained by PET imaging of regional gas exchange.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16352758/
Reproducibility of repeated measures of deuterium substituted [11C]L-deprenyl ([11C]L-deprenyl-D2) binding in the human brain,"J Logan, J S Fowler, N D Volkow, G J Wang, R R MacGregor, C Shea","The purpose of this study was to assess the reproducibility of repeated positron emission tomography (PET) measures of brain monoamine oxidase B (MAO B) using deuterium-substituted [11C]L-deprenyl ([11C]L-deprenyl-D2) in normal subjects and to validate the method used for estimating the kinetic constants from the irreversible 3-compartment model applied to the tracer binding. Five normal healthy subjects (age range 23-73 years) each received two PET scans with [11C]L-deprenyl-D2. The time interval between scans was 7-27 days. Time-activity data from eight regions of interest and an arterial plasma input function was used to calculate lambda k3, a model term proportional to MAO B, and K1, the plasma to brain transfer constant that is related to blood flow. Linear (LIN) and nonlinear least-squares (NLLSQ) estimation methods were used to calculate the optimum model constants. A comparison of time-activity curves for scan 1 and scan 2 showed that the percent of change for peak uptake varied from -18.5 to 15.0% and that increases and decreases in uptake on scan 2 were associated with increases and decreases in the value of the arterial input of the tracer. Calculation of lambda k3 showed a difference between scan 1 and scan 2 in the global value ranging between -6.97 and 4.5% (average -2.1 +/- 4.7%). The average percent change for eight brain regions for the five subjects was -2.84 +/- 7.07%. Values of lambda k3 for scan 1 and scan 2 were highly correlated (r2 = 0.98; p < 0.0001; slope 0.955). Similarly, values of K1 showed a significant correlation between scan 1 and scan 2 (r2 = 0.61; p < 0.0001; slope 0.638) though the values for scan 2 were generally lower than those of scan 1. There was essentially no difference between the values of model constants calculated using the NLLSQ or LIN methods. Regional brain uptake of [11C]L-deprenyl-D2 varied between scan 1 and scan 2, driven by the differences in arterial tracer input. Application of a 3-compartment model to regional time-activity data and arterial input function yielded lambda k3 values for scan 1 and scan 2 with an average difference of -2.84 +/- 7.07%. Linear regression applied to values of lambda k3 from the LIN and NLLSQ methods validated the use of the linear method for calculating lambda k3.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10755644/

Using canine models of hypoxic myocardium, we report our findings on *Cu-ATSM PET (*Cu is defined as either (60)Cu, (61)Cu, or (64)Cu) for the delineation of ischemic and hypoxic myocardium.

Methods: In protocol I, myocardial hypoxia was induced by global hypoxia (n = 3). In protocol II, myocardial ischemia was generated by occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery (n = 9). In protocol III, coronary artery stenosis was induced by a stenosis in the left anterior descending coronary artery (n = 4). PET dynamic data were acquired immediately after tracer injection. Tracer retention kinetics were analyzed using either monoexponential analysis (1/k(mono)) or a simple 2-compartment model (1/k(4)).

Results: In protocol I, tracer retention in hypoxic myocardium was 2-fold greater than in normal myocardium, despite a 7-fold increase in blood flow (normal, 0.70 +/- 0.42 mL.min(-1).g(-1); hypoxic, 4.94 +/- 3.00 mL.min(-1).g(-1) [P < 0.005]). In protocol II, approximately 3 h after occlusion, retention of *Cu-ATSM within 20 min was greater in ischemic regions (myocardial blood flow, 0.28 +/- 0.26 mL.min(-1).g(-1)) than in normal tissue (myocardial blood flow, 0.52 +/- 0.19 mL.min(-1).g(-1)) (1/k(mono), 40.72 +/- 39.0 min vs. 26.69 +/- 22.29 min [P < 0.05]; 1/k(4), 6.85 +/- 4.90 min vs. 3.51 +/- 1.97 min [P < 0.05]). In selected dogs, tracer retention decreased at 24 h, suggesting the development of necrosis with no subsequent retention of *Cu-ATSM.

Development of a thin layer chromatography method for plasma correction of [18F]fluorocholine metabolites in positron emission tomography quantification studies in humans,"Marina Villar, Manuel Valiente, María Toscano, Margalida Galmés, Carlos González, Marta Ortiz, Fernando Vega, Magdalena Oporto, Pedro Bibiloni, José Luis Chinchilla, Jesús Molina, Ángel Ríos, Cristina Peña, Sebastià Rubí","Introduction: After its intravenous injection, [18F]fluorocholine is oxidized by choline-oxidase into its main plasma metabolite, [18F]fluorobetaine. If PET kinetic modeling quantification of [18F]fluorocholine uptake is intended, the plasma input time-activity-curve of the parent tracer must be obtained, i.e., the fraction of the total plasma radioactivity corresponding to the nonmetabolized [18F]fluorocholine at each time has to be known. Hence our aim was to develop an easy-routine Thin-Layer-Chromatography (TLC) method to separate and quantify the relative fractions of [18F]fluorocholine and [18F]fluorobetaine as a function of time during PET imaging in humans.

Methods: First, we tested several combinations of solvents systems and layers to select the one showing the best resolution on non-radioactive standards. Thereafter, [18F]fluorobetaine was obtained through chemical oxidation of an [18F]fluorocholine sample at diferent incubation times and we applied the selected TLC-system to aliquots of this oxidation solution, both in a saline and in human deproteinized plasma matrices. The plates were detected by a radio-TLC-scanner. This TLC-system was finally applied to arterial plasma samples from 9 patients with high-grade-glioma undergoing brain PET imaging and a parent fraction curve was obtained in each of them.

Results: A TLC-system based on Silica-Gel-60//MeOH-NH3was selected from the choline/betaine non-radioactive standards assay. Radiochromatograms of [18F]fluorocholine oxidation solution yielded two separated and well-defined peaks, Rf = 0,03 ([18F]fluorocholine) and Rf = 0.78 (18F]fluorobetaine) consistent with those observed on non-radioactive standards. During the oxidation, the [18F]fluorocholine radioactivity peak decreased progressively at several incubation times, while the other peak ([18F]fluorobetaine) increased accordingly. The mean values of the parent fraction of [18F]fluorocholine of the 9 patients studied (mean+/-SD) were 94% ± 6%, 58% ± 15%, 43% ± 10%, 39% ± 6% and 37% ± 6% at 2.8 min, 5.8 min, 8.8 min, 11.7 min and 14.7 min post-injection, respectively.

Conclusions: We have developed a TLC-system, easy to perform in a standard radiopharmacy unit, that enables the metabolite correction of arterial input function of [18F]fluorocholine in patients undergoing PET oncologic quantitative imaging.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31473490/

Accuracy of arterial [18F]-Fluorodeoxyglucose uptake quantification: A kinetic modeling study,"Jakub Toczek, Jing Wu, Ansel T Hillmer, Jinah Han, Irina Esterlis, Kelly P Cosgrove, Chi Liu, Mehran M Sadeghi","2-deoxy-2- [18F] fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) PET is commonly used for the assessment of vessel wall inflammation. Guidelines for analysis of arterial wall FDG signal recommend the use of the average of maximal standardized uptake value (mean SUVmax) and target-to-blood (mean TBRmax) ratio. However, these methods have not been validated against a gold standard such as tissue activity ex vivo or net uptake rate of FDG (Ki) obtained using kinetic modeling. We sought to evaluate the accuracy of mean SUVmaxand mean TBRmaxfor aortic wall FDG signal quantification in comparison with the net uptake rate of FDG.

Methods: Dynamic PET data from 13 subjects without prior history of cardiovascular disease who enrolled in a study of vascular inflammation were used for this analysis. Ex vivo measurement of plasma activity was used as the input function and voxel-by-voxel Patlak analysis was performed with t* = 20 minute to obtain the Kiimage. The FDG signal in the ascending aortic wall was quantified on PET images following recent guidelines for vascular imaging to determine mean SUVmaxand mean TBRmax.

Results: The Kiin the ascending aortic wall did not correlate with mean SUVmax(r = 0.10, P = NS), but correlated with mean TBRmax(r = 0.82, P < 0.001) (Figure 1B). Kiand Ki_maxstrongly correlated (R = 0.96, P < 0.0001) and similar to Ki, Ki_maxdid not correlate with mean SUVmax(r = 0.17, P = NS), but correlated with mean TBRmax(r = 0.83, P < 0.001).

Conclusions: Kinetic modeling supports the use of mean TBRmaxas a surrogate for the net uptake rate of FDG in the arterial wall. These results are relevant to any PET imaging agent, regardless of the biological significance of the tracer uptake in the vessel wall.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32043239/
"Dosimetry of 18F-labeled tyrosine kinase inhibitor SKI-249380, a dasatinib-tracer for PET imaging","Mark P S Dunphy, Pat Zanzonico, Darren Veach, Romel Somwar, Nagavarakishore Pillarsetty, Jason Lewis, Steven Larson","Purpose: To obtain estimates of human normal-organ radiation doses of ¹⁸F-SKI-249380, as a prerequisite step towards first-in-human trial. ¹⁸F-SKI-249380 is a first-of-its-kind PET tracer for imaging the in vivo pharmacokinetics of dasatinib, an investigational targeted therapy for solid malignancies.

Procedures: Isoflurane-anesthetized mice received tracer dose via tail vein. Organ time-integrated activity coefficients, fractional urinary and hepatobiliary excretion, and total-body clearance kinetics were derived from PET data, with allometric extrapolation to the Standard Man anatomic model and normal-organ-absorbed dose calculations using OLINDA/EXM software.

Results: The human effective dose was 0.031 mSv/MBq. The critical organ was the upper large intestine, with a dose equivalent of 0.25 mSv/MBq. A 190-MBq administered activity of ¹⁸F-SKI-249380 is thus predicted to expose an adult human to radiation doses generally comparable to those of routinely used diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals.

Conclusions: Animal-based human dose estimates support first-in-human testing of ¹⁸F-SKI-249380.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21161687/
Pharmacokinetic analysis of [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-TOC PET in meningiomas for assessment of in vivo somatostatin receptor subtype 2,"Asma Bashir, Mark Bitsch Vestergaard, Tina Binderup, Helle Broholm, Lisbeth Marner, Morten Ziebell, Kåre Fugleholm, Tiit Mathiesen, Andreas Kjær, Ian Law","Purpose: DOTA-D-Phe1-Tyr3-octreotide with gallium-68 ([68Ga]Ga-DOTA-TOC) is one of the PET tracers that forms the basis for peptide receptor radionuclide therapy based on somatostatin receptor subtype 2 (SSTR2) expression in meningiomas. Yet, the quantitative relationship between [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-TOC accumulation and SSTR2 is unknown. We conducted a correlative analysis of a range of [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-TOC PET metric(s) as imaging surrogate(s) of the receptor binding in meningiomas by correlating the PET results with SSTR2 expression from surgical specimens. We additionally investigated possible influences of secondary biological factors such as vascularization, inflammation and proliferation.

Methods: Fifteen patients with MRI-presumed or recurrent meningiomas underwent a 60-min dynamic [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-TOC PET/CT before surgery. The PET data comprised maximum and mean standardized uptake values (SUVmax, SUVmean) with and without normalization to reference regions, and quantitative measurements derived from kinetic modelling using a reversible two-tissue compartment model with the fractional blood volume (VB). Expressions of SSTR2 and proliferation (Ki-67, phosphohistone-H3, proliferating cell nuclear antigen) were determined by immunohistochemistry and/or quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), while biomarkers of vascularization (vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), endothelial marker CD34) and inflammation (cytokine interleukin-18, microglia/macrophage-specific marker CD68) by qPCR.

Results: Histopathology revealed 12 World Health Organization (WHO) grade I and three WHO grade II meningiomas showing no link to SSTR2. The majority of [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-TOC PET metrics showed significant associations with SSTR2 protein, while all PET metrics were positively correlated with SSTR2 mRNA with the best results for mean tumour-to-blood ratio (TBRmean) (r = 0.757, P = 0.001) and SUVmean(r = 0.714, P = 0.003). Significant positive correlations were also found between [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-TOC PET metrics, and VEGFA and VB. SSTR2 mRNA was moderately correlated with VEGFA (r = 0.539, P = 0.038). Neither [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-TOC PET metrics nor SSTR2 were correlated with proliferation or inflammation.

Conclusion: [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-TOC accumulation in meningiomas is associated with SSTR2 binding and vascularization with TBRmeanbeing the best PET metric for assessing SSTR2.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32170347/
MCP-Net: Introducing Patlak Loss Optimization to Whole-body Dynamic PET Inter-frame Motion Correction,"Xueqi Guo, Bo Zhou, Xiongchao Chen, Ming-Kai Chen, Chi Liu, Nicha C Dvornek","In whole-body dynamic positron emission tomography (PET), inter-frame subject motion causes spatial misalignment and affects parametric imaging. Many of the current deep learning inter-frame motion correction techniques focus solely on the anatomy-based registration problem, neglecting the tracer kinetics that contains functional information. To directly reduce the Patlak fitting error for18F-FDG and further improve model performance, we propose an interframe motion correction framework with Patlak loss optimization integrated into the neural network (MCP-Net). The MCP-Net consists of a multiple-frame motion estimation block, an image-warping block, and an analytical Patlak block that estimates Patlak fitting using motion-corrected frames and the input function. A novel Patlak loss penalty component utilizing mean squared percentage fitting error is added to the loss function to reinforce the motion correction. The parametric images were generated using standard Patlak analysis following motion correction. Our framework enhanced the spatial alignment in both dynamic frames and parametric images and lowered normalized fitting error when compared to both conventional and deep learning benchmarks. MCP-Net also achieved the lowest motion prediction error and showed the best generalization capability. The potential of enhancing network performance and improving the quantitative accuracy of dynamic PET by directly utilizing tracer kinetics is suggested.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37368811/
The suitability of [11C]-alpha-methyl-L-tryptophan as a tracer for serotonin synthesis: studies with dual administration of [11C] and [14C] labeled tracer,"S E Shoaf, R E Carson, D Hommer, W A Williams, J D Higley, B Schmall, P Herscovitch, W C Eckelman, M Linnoila","The tracer [11C]-alpha-methyl-L-tryptophan (alphaMTP) has been used to measure brain serotonin synthesis rates with positron emission tomography (PET). To address questions about the accuracy of the kinetic model, [14C]alphaMTP was used to directly measure conversion to [14C]-alpha-methyl-serotonin (alphaM5HT) in monkeys that had been previously studied with PET and [11C]alphaMTP. Four male, fasted, isoflurane-anesthetized rhesus monkeys were studied with [11C]alphaMTP and PET. Immediately after the initial 3-hour scan, a second dose of [11C]alphaMTP was coinjected with 1 mCi of [14C]alphaMTP, and additional PET data were collected. Approximately 90 minutes after the second alphaMTP administration, the animals were killed with an overdose of phenobarbital, and brain samples from 21 regions were taken and analyzed by HPLC. Minimal conversion of alphaMTP to alphaM5HT occurred; HPLC analysis of 14C radioactivity showed that greater than 96% of the total counts were in fractions corresponding to the alphaMTP peak. Brain concentrations of serotonin, tryptophan, 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid, and alphaMTP also were determined fluorometrically using external quantification. Patlak plots generated from PET images acquired over 3 hours showed no time period of linear increase, and final slopes were not significantly different from zero, consistent with the finding of minimal conversion to [14C]alphaM5HT. These data indicate that in the 3-hour period after injection, [11C]alphaMTP is acting predominantly as a tracer of tryptophan uptake, not serotonin synthesis.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10698060/
Positron emission tomography: ligand imaging,"Mateen Moghbel, Andrew Newberg, Abass Alavi","Since it was first used to image the brain in 1976, positron emission tomography (PET) has been utilized in a wide range of neurologic and psychiatric applications. From cerebral metabolism to receptor concentration, various PET imaging techniques involving a host of radiopharmaceuticals have provided insight into countless facets of both the normal and diseased brain. Although the majority of these radiopharmaceuticals are still limited to the realm of research, one PET ligand in particular has gained widespread clinical use: (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose, a radiolabeled analog of glucose, has become an exceedingly prevalent clinical tool for the measurement of metabolism in organs throughout the body, including the brain. In recent years, a number of novel PET ligands have also made it through the US Food and Drug Administration approval process and been used clinically. However, gaining approval is by no means the only challenge facing these radiopharmaceuticals. Traversing the blood-brain barrier is a formidable obstacle in drug delivery, and accurately modeling tracer kinetics and correcting for the partial-volume effect are among the difficult tasks that remain once the ligand reaches its intended target. Even so, the use of PET imaging in neurology and psychiatry can be expected to expand in the coming years as novel radiopharmaceuticals continue to be developed.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27432668/
In vivo affinity of [18F]fallypride for striatal and extrastriatal dopamine D2 receptors in nonhuman primates,"Mark Slifstein, Dah-Ren Hwang, Yiyun Huang, Ningning Guo, Yasuhiko Sudo, Raj Narendran, Peter Talbot, Marc Laruelle","Rationale: [18F]Fallypride is a new and promising radiotracer, suitable for imaging D2 receptors with Positron Emission Tomography (PET) in both striatal and extrastriatal regions. The high signal to noise ratio of [18F]fallypride has been attributed to its high affinity for D2 receptors (K(D) of 0.03 nM, measured in vitro at room temperature).

Objectives: We sought to further characterize this tracer in terms of its in vivo affinity, possible affinity differences between brain regions and dependence of in vitro affinity on temperature.

Methods: PET scans were performed in baboons over a wide range of concentrations to measure the in vivo K(D) of [18F]fallypride in striatal and extrastriatal regions. Several analytical approaches were used, including nonlinear kinetic modeling and equilibrium methods. Also, in vitro assays were performed at 22 and 37 degrees C.

Results: No significant differences in the in vivo K(D) were detected between regions. In vivo K(D) of [18F]fallypride was 0.22+/-0.05 nM in striatum, 0.17+/-0.05 nM in thalamus, and 0.21+/-0.07 nM in hippocampus. These values were intermediate between in vitro K(D) measured at 22 (0.04+/-0.03 nM) and 37 degrees (2.03+/-1.07 nM).

Conclusion: The in vivo affinity of [18F]fallypride was not as high as previously estimated from in vitro values. This property might contribute to the favorable kinetic properties of the tracer. The in vivo affinity was similar between striatal and extrastriatal regions. This result indicates that the measured regional in vivo affinities of this tracer are not affected by putative regional differences in endogenous dopamine, and that [18F]fallypride is an appropriate tool to provide unbiased estimates of the occupancy of D2 receptors by antipsychotic drugs in striatal and extrastriatal regions.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15024551/
Dynamic PET evaluation of elevated FLT level after sorafenib treatment in mice bearing human renal cell carcinoma xenograft,"Naoyuki Ukon, Songji Zhao, Wenwen Yu, Yoichi Shimizu, Ken-Ichi Nishijima, Naoki Kubo, Yoshimasa Kitagawa, Nagara Tamaki, Kei Higashikawa, Hironobu Yasui, Yuji Kuge","Background: Sorafenib, an oral multikinase inhibitor, has anti-proliferative and anti-angiogenic activities and is therapeutically effective against renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Recently, we have evaluated the tumor responses to sorafenib treatment in a RCC xenograft using [Methyl-3H(N)]-3'-fluoro-3'-deoxythythymidine ([3H]FLT). Contrary to our expectation, the FLT level in the tumor significantly increased after the treatment. In this study, to clarify the reason for the elevated FLT level, dynamic 3'-[18F]fluoro-3'-deoxythymidine ([18F]FLT) positron emission tomography (PET) and kinetic studies were performed in mice bearing a RCC xenograft (A498). The A498 xenograft was established in nude mice, and the mice were assigned to the control (n = 5) and treatment (n = 5) groups. The mice in the treatment group were orally given sorafenib (20 mg/kg/day p.o.) once daily for 3 days. Twenty-four hours after the treatment, dynamic [18F]FLT PET was performed by small-animal PET. Three-dimensional regions of interest (ROIs) were manually defined for the tumors. A three-compartment model fitting was carried out to estimate four rate constants using the time activity curve (TAC) in the tumor and the blood clearance rate of [18F]FLT.

Results: The dynamic pattern of [18F]FLT levels in the tumor significantly changed after the treatment. The rate constant of [18F]FLT phosphorylation (k3) was significantly higher in the treatment group (0.111 ± 0.027 [1/min]) than in the control group (0.082 ± 0.009 [1/min]). No significant changes were observed in the distribution volume, the ratio of [18F]FLT forward transport (K1) to reverse transport (k2), between the two groups (0.556 ± 0.073 and 0.641 ± 0.052 [mL/g] in the control group).

Conclusions: Our dynamic PET studies indicated that the increase in FLT level may be caused by the phosphorylation of FLT in the tumor after the sorafenib treatment in the mice bearing a RCC xenograft. Dynamic PET studies with kinetic modeling could provide improved understanding of the biochemical processes involved in tumor responses to therapy.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27957722/
Fundamentals of positron emission tomography and applications in preclinical drug development,S R Cherry,"Positron emission tomography (PET) is a nuclear imaging technique that can dynamically image trace amounts of positron-labeled radiopharmaceuticals in vivo. Tracer concentrations can be determined quantitatively, and by application of appropriate tracer kinetic models, the rates of a wide range of different biological processes can be measured noninvasively in humans. PET has been used as a research tool for more than 25 years and has also found clinical applications, particularly in oncology, neurological disorders, and cardiovascular disease. Recently, there has been tremendous interest in applying PET technology to in vivo small-animal imaging. Significant improvements in the imaging technology now permit a wide range of PET studies in mice and rats, using compact, relatively low-cost, dedicated small-animal PET scanners. This article reviews the fundamental basis of PET imaging and discusses the development of small-animal PET scanners and their possible application in preclinical drug development.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11361044/
[18F]Fluoride uptake in various bone types and soft tissues in rat,"Nina Savisto, Tove J Grönroos, Vesa Oikonen, Johan Rajander, Eliisa Löyttyniemi, Jörgen Bergman, Sarita Forsback, Olof Solin, Merja Haaparanta-Solin","Background: In the development of new18F-labelled tracers, it is important to assess the amount of released [18F]fluoride taken up in the bones of experimental animals because all18F-labelled PET-tracers are prone, to lesser or higher degree, to undergo defluorination, with subsequent release of [18F]fluoride during scanning. However, the pharmacokinetics of [18F]fluoride in bones and other organs of healthy rats have not been well documented in a comprehensive manner. We aimed to study pharmacokinetics of [18F]NaF in rats in order to increase our understanding of the biodistribution of [18F]fluoride originating from defluorination of18F-labelled tracers. We studied [18F]fluoride uptake in Sprague Dawley rat bones, including the epiphyseal parts of the tibia and radius, the mandible, ilium, lumbar vertebrae, costochondral joints, tibia, radius, and ribs, with 60-min in vivo PET/CT imaging. Kinetic parameters, K1, Ki, Ki/K1, and k3were calculated with a three-compartment model. In addition, separate groups of male and female rats were studied with ex vivo bone and soft tissue harvesting and gamma counting over a 6-h period.

Results: [18F]fluoride perfusion and uptake varied among the different bones. [18F]fluoride uptake was higher in trabecular bones, due to high perfusion and osteoblastic activity, compared to cortical bones. In soft tissues, the organ-to-blood uptake ratios increased over time in the eyes, lungs, brain, testes, and ovaries during the 6 h study period.

Conclusion: Understanding the pharmacokinetics of [18F]fluoride in various bones and soft tissues is highly useful for assessing18F-labelled radiotracers that release [18F]fluoride.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36913049/
Fluorinated PET Tracers for Molecular Imaging of σ1 Receptors in the Central Nervous System,"Frauke Weber, Peter Brust, Erik Laurini, Sabrina Pricl, Bernhard Wünsch","At first the role of σ1receptors in various neurological, psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders is discussed. In the second part, the principle of positron emission tomography (PET ) is described and the known fluorinated PET tracers for labeling of σ1receptors are presented. The third part focuses on fluoroalkyl substituted spirocyclic PET tracers, which represent the most promising class of fluorinated PET tracers reported so far. The homologous fluoroalkyl derivatives 12-15 show high σ1affinity (Ki= 0.59-1.4 nM) and high selectivity over the σ2subtype (408-1331-fold). The enantiomers of the fluoroethyl derivative fluspidine 13 were prepared and pharmacologically characterized. Whereas the (S)-configured enantiomer (S)-13 (Ki= 2.3 nM) is 4-fold less active than the (R)-enantiomer (R)-13 (Ki= 0.57 nM), (S)-13 is metabolically more stable. The interactions of (S)-13 and (R)-13 with the σ1receptor were analyzed at the molecular level using the 3D homology model. In an automated radiosynthesis [18F](S)-13 and [18F](R)-13 were prepared by nucleophilic substitution of the tosylates (S)-17 and (R)-17 with K[18F]F in high radiochemical yield, high radiochemical purity and short reaction time. Application of both enantiomers [18F](S)-13 and [18F](R)-13 to mice and piglets led to fast uptake into the brain, but [18F](R)-13 did not show washout from the brain indicating a quasi-irreversible binding. Both radiotracers [18F](S)-13 and [18F](R)-13 were able to label regions in the mouse and piglet brain with high σ1receptor density. The specific binding of the enantiomeric tracers [18F](S)-13 and [18F](R)-13 could be replaced by the selective σ1ligand SA4503.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28315263/
Patterns of Mitochondrial TSPO Binding in Cerebral Small Vessel Disease: An in vivo PET Study With Neuropathological Comparison,"Paul Wright, Mattia Veronese, Ndabezinhle Mazibuko, Federico E Turkheimer, Eugenii A Rabiner, Clive G Ballard, Steven C R Williams, Avinash Kumar Hari Narayanan, Bahiya Osrah, Ricky Williams, Tiago R Marques, Oliver D Howes, Federico Roncaroli, Michael J O'Sullivan","Small vessel disease (SVD) is associated with cognitive impairment in older age and be implicated in vascular dementia. Post-mortem studies show proliferation of activated microglia in the affected white matter. However, the role of inflammation in SVD pathogenesis is incompletely understood and better biomarkers are needed. We hypothesized that expression of the 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO), a marker of microglial activation, would be higher in SVD. Positron emission tomography (PET) was performed with the second-generation TSPO ligand [11C]PBR28 in 11 participants with SVD. TSPO binding was evaluated by a two-tissue compartment model, with and without a vascular binding component, in white matter hyperintensities (WMH) and normal-appearing white matter (NAWM). In post-mortem tissue, in a separate cohort of individuals with SVD, immunohistochemistry was performed for TSPO and a pan-microglial marker Iba1. Kinetic modeling showed reduced tracer volume and blood volume fraction in WMH compared with NAWM, but a significant increase in vascular binding. Vascular [11C]PBR28 binding was also increased compared with normal-appearing white matter of healthy participants free of SVD. Immunohistochemistry showed a diffuse increase in microglial staining (with Iba1) in sampled tissue in SVD compared with control samples, but with only a subset of microglia staining positively for TSPO. Intense TSPO staining was observed in the vicinity of damaged small blood vessels, which included perivascular macrophages. The results suggest an altered phenotype of activated microglia, with reduced TSPO expression, in the areas of greatest white matter ischemia in SVD, with implications for the interpretation of TSPO PET studies in older individuals or those with vascular risk factors.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33178101/
18F-Florbetaben PET/CT for the Diagnosis and Subtyping of Cardiac Amyloidosis: A Case Series and Review of the Literature,"Yu-Cheng Shih, Bing-Hsiean Tzeng, Meng-Chieh Tsai, Yuan-Bin Yu, Yu-Chien Shiau, Shan-Ying Wang, Yen-Wen Wu","Objectives: Cardiac amyloidosis (CA) is a type of systemic amyloidosis. Amyloid-targeting positron emission tomography (PET) has shown potential as an imaging method for CA. However, the optimal imaging protocol and role of18F-florbetaben (FBB) PET in the diagnosis and subtyping of CA have yet to be determined.

Methods: Patients with suspected CA who had positive or equivocal results of technetium-99m pyrophosphate (PYP) scintigraphy were enrolled for dynamic and late FBB PET imaging. In addition to visual assessment, a kinetic modeling-based approach including target-to-background ratio (TBR) and myocardial retention fraction (RF) of serial images reconstructed from a 20-min dynamic acquisition, and a late image at 110 min post-injection were performed. We compared FBB PET measures of four typical patients with light chain amyloidosis (AL), wild-type transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTRwt), variant transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTRv), and heart failure, respectively. We also reviewed the literature on the clinical use of amyloid PET in CA.

Results: Myocardial tracer retention was only found in the AL patient on the late images. TBR and RF were highest in the AL patient followed by the ATTRwt patient, and lowest in the ATTRv and non-CA patients.

Conclusions: FBB PET has potential in the detection and non-invasive subtyping of CA, especially in subjects with equivocal PYP findings or monoclonal gammopathy.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39308657/
In vivo quantification of neurofibrillary tangles with [18F]MK-6240,"Tharick A Pascoal, Monica Shin, Min Su Kang, Mira Chamoun, Daniel Chartrand, Sulantha Mathotaarachchi, Idriss Bennacef, Joseph Therriault, Kok Pin Ng, Robert Hopewell, Reda Bouhachi, Hung-Hsin Hsiao, Andrea L Benedet, Jean-Paul Soucy, Gassan Massarweh, Serge Gauthier, Pedro Rosa-Neto","Background: Imaging agents capable of quantifying the brain's tau aggregates will allow a more precise staging of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The aim of the present study was to examine the in vitro properties as well as the in vivo kinetics, using gold standard methods, of the novel positron emission tomography (PET) tau imaging agent [18F]MK-6240.

Methods: In vitro properties of [18F]MK-6240 were estimated with autoradiography in postmortem brain tissues of 14 subjects (seven AD patients and seven age-matched controls). In vivo quantification of [18F]MK-6240 binding was performed in 16 subjects (four AD patients, three mild cognitive impairment patients, six healthy elderly individuals, and three healthy young individuals) who underwent 180-min dynamic scans; six subjects had arterial sampling for metabolite correction. Simplified approaches for [18F]MK-6240 quantification were validated using full kinetic modeling with metabolite-corrected arterial input function. All participants also underwent amyloid-PET and structural magnetic resonance imaging.

Results: In vitro [18F]MK-6240 uptake was higher in AD patients than in age-matched controls in brain regions expected to contain tangles such as the hippocampus, whereas no difference was found in the cerebellar gray matter. In vivo, [18F]MK-6240 displayed favorable kinetics with rapid brain delivery and washout. The cerebellar gray matter had low binding across individuals, showing potential for use as a reference region. A reversible two-tissue compartment model well described the time-activity curves across individuals and brain regions. Distribution volume ratios using the plasma input and standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs) calculated after the binding approached equilibrium (90 min) were correlated and higher in mild cognitive impairment or AD dementia patients than in controls. Reliability analysis revealed robust SUVRs calculated from 90 to 110 min, while earlier time points provided inaccurate estimates.

Conclusions: This evaluation shows an [18F]MK-6240 distribution in concordance with postmortem studies and that simplified quantitative approaches such as the SUVR offer valid estimates of neurofibrillary tangle load 90 min post injection. [18F]MK-6240 is a promising tau tracer with the potential to be applied in the disease diagnosis and assessment of therapeutic interventions.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30064520/
Use of a beta microprobe system to measure arterial input function in PET via an arteriovenous shunt in rats,"Geoff Warnock, Mohamed-Ali Bahri, David Goblet, Fabrice Giacomelli, Christian Lemaire, Joel Aerts, Alain Seret, Xavier Langlois, Andre Luxen, Alain Plenevaux","Background: Kinetic modeling of physiological function using imaging techniques requires the accurate measurement of the time-activity curve of the tracer in plasma, known as the arterial input function (IF). The measurement of IF can be achieved through manual blood sampling, the use of small counting systems such as beta microprobes, or by derivation from PET images. Previous studies using beta microprobe systems to continuously measure IF have suffered from high background counts.

Methods: In the present study, a light-insensitive beta microprobe with a temporal resolution of up to 1 s was used in combination with a pump-driven femoral arteriovenous shunt to measure IF in rats. The shunt apparatus was designed such that the placement of the beta microprobe was highly reproducible. The probe-derived IF was compared to that obtained from manual sampling at 5-s intervals and IF derived from a left ventricle VOI in a dynamic PET image of the heart.

Results: Probe-derived IFs were very well matched to that obtained by ""gold standard"" manual blood sampling, but with an increased temporal resolution of up to 1 s. The area under the curve (AUC) ratio between probe- and manually derived IFs was 1.07 ± 0.05 with a coefficient of variation of 0.04. However, image-derived IFs were significantly underestimated compared to the manually sampled IFs, with an AUC ratio of 0.76 ± 0.24 with a coefficient of variation of 0.32.

Conclusions: IF derived from the beta microprobe accurately represented the IF as measured by blood sampling, was reproducible, and was more accurate than an image-derived technique. The use of the shunt removed problems of tissue-background activity, and the use of a light-tight probe with minimal gamma sensitivity refined the system. The probe/shunt apparatus can be used in both microprobe and PET studies.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22214227/
Validation of dynamic [18F]FE-PE2I PET for estimation of relative regional cerebral blood flow: a comparison with [15O]H2O PET,"Susanna Jakobson Mo, Jan Axelsson, Lars Stiernman, Katrine Riklund","Background: Dopamine transporter (DAT) imaging is used in the diagnostic work-up in suspected parkinsonian syndromes and dementia with Lewy bodies but cannot differentiate between these syndromes, and an extra brain imaging examination of the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) or glucose metabolism is often needed for differential diagnosis. The requirement of two different imaging examinations is resource-consuming and inconvenient for the patients. Therefore, imaging of both cortical blood flow and DAT imaging with the same radiotracer would be more convenient and cost-effective. The aim of this study was to test whether relative regional cerebral blood flow (rCBFR) can be measured with the DAT-specific positron emission tomography (PET) tracer [18F]FE-PE2I (FE-PE2I), by validation with cerebral perfusion measured with [15O]H2O PET (H2O).

Methods: The rCBFRwas quantified by kinetic modeling for FE-PE2I (R1) and H2O (F). The R1 was calculated using the simplified reference tissue model, and F was calculated with a modified Koopman double-integration method. The linear relationship and intraclass correlation (ICC) between R1 and F were tested in image data derived from 29 patients with recent onset parkinsonism and 30 healthy controls.

Results: There was a strong linear correlation across all subjects between R1 and F in the frontal, parietal, temporal, cingulate and occipital cortex as well as in the striatum (r ≥ 0.731-0.905, p < 0.001) with a good-to-excellent ICC, ranging from 0.727 to 0.943 (p < 0.001).

Conclusions: Our results suggest that FE-PE2I may be used as a proxy for cerebral perfusion, thus potentially serving as a radiotracer for assessment of both DAT availability and rCBFRin one single dynamic scan. This could be valuable in the differential diagnosis of parkinsonian syndromes.

Parametric Mapping for TSPO PET Imaging with Spectral Analysis Impulsive Response Function,"Mattia Veronese, Marcello Tuosto, Tiago Reis Marques, Oliver Howes, Belen Pascual, Meixiang Yu, Joseph C Masdeu, Federico Turkheimer, Alessandra Bertoldo, Paolo Zanotti-Fregonara","Purpose: The aim of this study was to investigate the use of spectral analysis (SA) for voxel-wise analysis of TSPO PET imaging studies. TSPO PET quantification is methodologically complicated by the heterogeneity of TSPO expression and its cell-dependent modulation during neuroinflammatory response. Compartmental models to account for this complexity exist, but they are unreliable at the high noise typical of voxel data. On the contrary, SA is noise-robust for parametric mapping and provides useful information about tracer kinetics with a free compartmental structure.

Procedures: SA impulse response function (IRF) calculated at 90 min after tracer injection was used as main parameter of interest in 3 independent PET imaging studies to investigate its sensitivity to (1) a TSPO genetic polymorphism (rs6971) known to affect tracer binding in a cross-sectional analysis of healthy controls scanned with [11C]PBR28 PET; (2) TSPO density with [11C]PBR28 in a competitive blocking study with a TSPO blocker, XBD173; and (3) the higher affinity of a second radiotracer for TSPO, by using data from a head-to-head comparison between [11C]PBR28 and [11C]ER176 scans.

Results: SA-IRF produced parametric maps of visually good quality. These were sensitive to TSPO genotype (mean relative difference between high- and mixed-affinity binders = 25 %) and TSPO availability (mean signal displacement after 90 mg oral administration of XBD173 = 39 %). Regional averages of voxel-wise IRF estimates were strongly associated with regional total distribution volume (VT) estimated with a 2-tissue compartmental model with vascular compartment (Pearson's r = 0.86 ± 0.11) but less strongly with standard 2TCM-VT(Pearson's r = 0.76 ± 0.32). Finally, SA-IRF estimates for [11C]ER176 were significantly higher than [11C]PBR28 ones, consistent with the higher amount of specific binding of the former tracer.

Conclusions: SA-IRF can be used for voxel-wise quantification of TSPO PET data because it generates high-quality parametric maps, it is sensitive to TSPO availability and genotype, and it accounts for the complexity of TSPO tracer kinetics with no additional assumptions.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33475944/
Biodistribution and radiation dosimetry of the synthetic nonmetabolized amino acid analogue anti-18F-FACBC in humans,"Jonathon A Nye, David M Schuster, Weiping Yu, Vernon M Camp, Mark M Goodman, John R Votaw","The synthetic leucine amino acid analog anti-1-amino-3-(18)F-fluorocyclobutane-1-carboxylic acid (anti-(18)F-FACBC) is a recently developed ligand that permits the evaluation of the L-amino acid transport system. This study evaluated the whole-body radiation burden of anti-(18)F-FACBC in humans.

Methods: Serial whole-body PET/CT scans of 6 healthy volunteers (3 male and 3 female) were acquired for 2 h after a bolus injection of anti-(18)F-FACBC (366 +/- 51 MBq). Organ-specific time-activity curves were extracted from the reconstructed data and integrated to evaluate the individual organ residence times. A uniform activity distribution was assumed in the body organs with urine collection after the study. Estimates of radiation burden to the human body were calculated on the basis of the recommendations of the MIRD committee. The updated dynamic bladder model was used to calculate dose to the bladder wall.

Results: All volunteers showed initially high uptake in the pancreas and liver, followed by rapid clearance. Skeletal muscle and bone marrow showed lower and prolonged uptake, with clearance dominated by the tracer half-life. The liver was the critical organ, with a mean absorbed dose of 52.2 microGy/MBq. The estimated effective dose was 14.1 microSv/MBq, representing less than 20% of the dose limit recommended by the Radioactive Drug Research Committee for a 370-MBq injection. Bladder excretion was low and initially observed 6 min after injection, well after peak tracer uptake in the body organs.

Conclusion: The PET whole-body dosimetry estimates indicate that an approximately 370-MBq injection of anti-(18)F-FACBC yields good imaging and acceptable dosimetry. The nonmetabolized nature of this tracer is favorable for extraction of relevant physiologic parameters from kinetic models.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17504867/
Kinetic analysis of dominant intraprostatic lesion of prostate cancer using quantitative dynamic [18F]DCFPyL-PET: comparison to [18F]fluorocholine-PET,"Dae-Myoung Yang, Fiona Li, Glenn Bauman, Joseph Chin, Stephen Pautler, Madeleine Moussa, Irina Rachinsky, John Valliant, Ting-Yim Lee","Purpose: Identification of the dominant intraprostatic lesion(s) (DILs) can facilitate diagnosis and treatment by targeting biologically significant intra-prostatic foci. A PSMA ligand, [18F]DCFPyL (2-(3-{1-carboxy-5-[(6-[18F]fluoro-pyridine-3-carbonyl)-amino]-pentyl}-ureido)-pentanedioic acid), is better than choline-based [18F]FCH (fluorocholine) in detecting and localizing DIL because of higher tumour contrast, particularly when imaging is delayed to 1 h post-injection. The goal of this study was to investigate whether the different imaging performance of [18F]FCH and [18F]DCFPyL can be explained by their kinetic behaviour in prostate cancer (PCa) and to evaluate whether DIL can be accurately detected and localized using a short duration dynamic positron emission tomography (PET).

Methods: 19 and 23 PCa patients were evaluated with dynamic [18F]DCFPyL and [18F]FCH PET, respectively. The dynamic imaging protocol with each tracer had a total imaging time of 22 min and consisted of multiple frames with acquisition times from 10 to 180 s. Tumour and benign tissue regions identified by sextant biopsy were compared using standardized uptake value (SUV) and tracer kinetic parameters from kinetic analysis of time-activity curves.

Results: For [18F]DCFPyL, logistic regression identified Kiand k4as the optimal model to discriminate tumour from benign tissue (84.2% sensitivity and 94.7% specificity), while only SUV was predictive for [18F]FCH (82.6% sensitivity and 87.0% specificity). The higher k3(binding) of [18F]FCH than [18F]DCFPyL explains why [18F]FCH SUV can differentiate tumour from benign tissue within minutes of injection. Superior [18F]DCFPyL tumour contrast was due to the higher k4/k3(more rapid washout) in benign tissue compared to tumour tissue.

Conclusions: DIL was detected with good sensitivity and specificity using 22-min dynamic [18F]DCFPyL PET and avoids the need for delayed post-injection imaging timepoints. The dissimilar in vivo kinetic behaviour of [18F]DCFPyL and [18F]FCH could explain their different SUV images.

Individual dosimetry system for targeted alpha therapy based on PHITS coupled with microdosimetric kinetic model,"Tatsuhiko Sato, Takuya Furuta, Yuwei Liu, Sadahiro Naka, Shushi Nagamori, Yoshikatsu Kanai, Tadashi Watabe","Background: An individual dosimetry system is essential for the evaluation of precise doses in nuclear medicine. The purpose of this study was to develop a system for calculating not only absorbed doses but also EQDX(α/β) from the PET-CT images of patients for targeted alpha therapy (TAT), considering the dose dependence of the relative biological effectiveness, the dose-rate effect, and the dose heterogeneity.

Methods: A general-purpose Monte Carlo particle transport code PHITS was employed as the dose calculation engine in the system, while the microdosimetric kinetic model was used for converting the absorbed dose to EQDX(α/β). PHITS input files for describing the geometry and source distribution of a patient are automatically created from PET-CT images, using newly developed modules of the radiotherapy package based on PHITS (RT-PHITS). We examined the performance of the system by calculating several organ doses using the PET-CT images of four healthy volunteers after injecting18F-NKO-035.

Results: The deposition energy map obtained from our system seems to be a blurred image of the corresponding PET data because annihilation γ-rays deposit their energies rather far from the source location. The calculated organ doses agree with the corresponding data obtained from OLINDA 2.0 within 20%, indicating the reliability of our developed system. Test calculations by replacing the labeled radionuclide from18F to211At suggest that large dose heterogeneity in a target volume is expected in TAT, resulting in a significant decrease of EQDX(α/β) for higher-activity injection.

Conclusions: As an extension of RT-PHITS, an individual dosimetry system for nuclear medicine was developed based on PHITS coupled with the microdosimetric kinetic model. It enables us to predict the therapeutic and side effects of TAT based on the clinical data largely available from conventional external radiotherapy.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33432383/
Preclinical evaluation of [18F]cabozantinib as a PET imaging agent in a prostate cancer mouse model,"Vegard Torp Lien, Sofie Celen, Syed Nuruddin, Bala Attili, Gilles Doumont, Gaetan Van Simaeys, Guy Bormans, Jo Klaveness, Dag Erlend Olberg","Introduction: Cabozantinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) approved for the treatment of medullary thyroid cancer, renal cell carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma, and is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of prostate cancer and others. It exerts its therapeutic effect mainly through inhibition of the tyrosine kinases MET (hepatocyte growth factor receptor) and VEGFR2 (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2), in addition to several other kinases involved in cancer. PET imaging with TKIs such as [18F]cabozantinib could potentially aid in cancer diagnosis and guide treatment. This study aims to evaluate the utility of [18F]cabozantinib as a PET imaging probe in PC3 tumor xenografted mice.

Methods: [18F]cabozantinib was evaluated in non-tumor and tumor bearing (PC3 xenografted) male mice by ex vivo biodistribution studies and in vivo μPET imaging. Pretreatment studies were performed in the tumor bearing mice with the MET inhibitor PF04217903. Mouse plasma was analyzed with HPLC to quantify radiometabolites. To further evaluate the binding specificity of [18F]cabozantinib, in vitro autoradiography studies on heart and PC3 tumor sections were performed in the presence of authentic cabozantinib or specific MET and VEGFR2 inhibitors.

Results: Tissue distribution studies in non-tumor bearing mice revealed slow blood clearance, absence of brain uptake and a high myocardial uptake. In the tumor bearing mice, tumor uptake was low (0.58 ± 0.20% ID/g at 30 min post tracer injection), which was confirmed by μPET imaging. No differences in tissue distribution and kinetics were observed in both biodistributions and μPET studies after pretreatment with the MET inhibitor PF04217903. At 30 min post tracer injection, 60 ± 3% of the recovered radioactivity in plasma in non-tumor bearing mice was present as intact tracer. [18F]cabozantinib binding in vitro to heart and tumor tissues was partly blocked in the presence of selective MET and VEGFR2 inhibitors (up to 40% block). The fraction of non-specific binding was relatively high for both tissues (66% for heart and 39% for tumor).

Conclusion: [18F]cabozantinib exhibits non-favorable properties as a PET imaging probe, demonstrated by slow excretion kinetics along with low tumor uptake and high non-specific binding in tumor and heart tissue. The results reflect cabozantinibs multi-kinase activity, making PET imaging of tumor specific kinase expression with [18F]cabozantinib challenging.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33422771/
Quantification of liver perfusion with [(15)O]H(2)O-PET and its relationship with glucose metabolism and substrate levels,"Lotfi Slimani, Nobuyuki Kudomi, Vesa Oikonen, M Jarvisalo, Jan Kiss, Alexandru Naum, Ronald Borra, Antti Viljanen, Hannu Sipila, Ele Ferrannini, Timo Savunen, Pirjo Nuutila, Patricia Iozzo","Background/aims: Hepatic perfusion plays an important role in liver physiology and disease. This study was undertaken to (a) validate the use of Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and oxygen-15-labeled water ([(15)O]H(2)O) to quantify hepatic and portal perfusion, and (b) examine relationships between portal perfusion and liver glucose and lipid metabolism.

Methods: Liver [(15)O]H(2)O-PET images were obtained in 14 pigs during fasting or hyperinsulinemia. Carotid arterial and portal venous blood were sampled for [(15)O]H(2)O activity; Doppler ultrasonography was used invasively as the reference method. A single arterial input compartment model was developed to estimate portal tracer kinetics and liver perfusion. Endogenous glucose production (EGP) and insulin-mediated whole body glucose uptake (wbGU) were determined by standard methods.

Results: Hepatic arterial and portal venous perfusions were 0.15+/-0.07 and 1.11+/-0.34 ml/min/ml of tissue, respectively. The agreement between ultrasonography and [(15)O]H(2)O-PET was good for total and portal liver perfusion, and poor for arterial perfusion. Portal perfusion was correlated with EGP (r=or+0.62, p=0.03), triglyceride (r=or+0.66, p=0.01), free fatty acid levels (r=or+0.76, p=0.003), and plasma lactate levels (r=or-0.81, p=0.0009).

Conclusions: Estimates of liver perfusion by [(15)O]H(2)O-PET compared well with those by ultrasonography. The method allowed to predict portal tracer concentrations which is essential in human studies. Portal perfusion may affect liver nutrient handling.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18384905/
(S)-(-)-[11C]nicotine binding assessed by PET: a dual tracer model evaluated in the rhesus monkey brain,"H Lundqvist, A Nordberg, P Hartvig, B Långström","A dual tracer model, consisting of the administration of 15O-water and (S)-(-)-[11C]nicotine in close succession, is suggested to assess nicotine binding in the brain. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) determined by 15O-water was used to flow compensate two nicotine model parameters, k1 and k2, obtained in a two-compartment kinetic model. In the present study, this dual tracer approach was evaluated in the rhesus monkey by altering the rCBF or by administering (S)-(-)-[11C]nicotine at either high or low specific radioactivity. The model parameter, k2' = k2/rCBF, was found to be independent of rCBF in different regions of interest in the monkey brain. The parameter, k2', increased significantly when (S)-(-)-[11C]nicotine was given at low specific radioactivity, indicating lower nicotine binding in the brain. Thus, this observation implies an influence on specific receptor binding on the corrected efflux rate constant. This dual tracer model may be useful in evaluating nicotine binding changes in the human brain and the effect of drug treatment in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer disease.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9772029/
"Cardiorenal ketone metabolism in healthy humans assessed by 11C-acetoacetate PET: effect of D-β-hydroxybutyrate, a meal, and age","Valérie St-Pierre, Gabriel Richard, Etienne Croteau, Mélanie Fortier, Camille Vandenberghe, André C Carpentier, Bernard Cuenoud, Stephen C Cunnane","The heart and kidney have a high energy requirement, but relatively little is known about their utilization of ketones as a potential energy source. We assessed the metabolism of the ketone tracer, carbon-11 acetoacetate (11C-AcAc), by the left and right ventricles of the heart and by the kidney using positron emission tomography (PET) in n = 10 healthy adults under four experimental conditions: a 4-h fast (fasted) ± a single 12 g oral dose of D-beta-hydroxybutyrate (D-BHB), and a single complete, liquid replacement meal (hereafter referred to as the ""fed"" condition) ± a single 12 g oral dose of D-BHB. Under these experimental conditions, the kinetics of11C-AcAc metabolism fitted a two-compartment model in the heart and a three-compartment model in the kidney. Plasma ketones were about 10-fold higher with the oral dose of D-BHB. During the four conditions, tracer kinetics were broadly similar in the myocardium and kidney cortex.11C-AcAc metabolism by the kidney pelvis was similar in three of the four study conditions but, later, peaked significantly higher than that in the cortex; the exception was that the tracer uptake was significantly lower in the fed condition without D-BHB.11C-AcAc uptake was significantly inversely correlated with age in the kidney cortex, and its oxidative metabolism was significantly positively correlated with age in the left ventricle. D-BHB blunted the insulin, gastric inhibitory peptide, and C-peptide response to the meal. This PET methodology and these acute metabolic perturbations would be suitable for future studies assessing cardiorenal ketone metabolism in conditions in which heart and kidney functions are experimentally modified or compromised by disease.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39497705/
Quantitative kinetic analysis of PET amyloid imaging agents [(11)C]BF227 and [(18)F]FACT in human brain,"Miho Shidahara, Hiroshi Watabe, Manabu Tashiro, Nobuyuki Okamura, Shozo Furumoto, Shoichi Watanuki, Katsutoshi Furukawa, Yuma Arakawa, Yoshihito Funaki, Ren Iwata, Kohsuke Gonda, Yukitsuka Kudo, Hiroyuki Arai, Kiichi Ishiwata, Kazuhiko Yanai","Introduction: The purpose of this study was to compare two amyloid imaging agents, [(11)C]BF227 and [(18)F]FACT (derivative from [(11)C]BF227) through quantitative pharmacokinetics analysis in human brain.

Methods: Positron emission tomography studies were performed on six elderly healthy control (HC) subjects and seven probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients with [(11)C]BF227 and 10 HC subjects and 10 probable AD patients with [(18)F]FACT. Data from nine regions of interest were analyzed by several approaches, namely non-linear least-squared fitting methods with arterial input functions (one-tissue compartment model(1TCM), two-tissue compartment model (2TCM)), Logan plot, and linearized methods with reference region (Reference Logan plot (RefLogan), MRTM0, MRTM2). We also evaluated SUV and SUVR for both tracers. The parameters estimated by several approaches were compared between two tracers for detectability of differences between HC and AD patients.

Results: For [(11)C]BF227, there were no significant difference of VT (2TCM, 1TCM) and SUV in all regions (Student t-test; p<0.05) and significant differences in the DVRs (Logan, RefLogan, and MRTM2) and SUVRs in six neocortical regions (p<0.05) between the HC and AD groups. For [(18)F]FACT, significant differences in DVRs (RefLogan, MRTM0, and MRTM2) were observed in more than four neocortical regions between the HC and AD groups (p<0.05), and the significant differences were found in SUVRs for two neocortical regions (inferior frontal coretex and lateral temporal coretex). Our results showed that both tracers can clearly distinguish between HC and AD groups although the pharmacokinetics and distribution patterns in brain for two tracers were substantially different.

Conclusion: This study revealed that although the PET amyloid imaging agents [(11)C]BF227 and [(18)F]FACT have similar chemical and biological properties, they have different pharmacokinetics, and caution must be paid for usage of the tracers.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26093494/
Imaging cardiac neuronal function and dysfunction,"Takahiro Higuchi, Markus Schwaiger","In recent years, the importance of alterations of cardiac autonomic nerve function in the pathophysiology of heart diseases including heart failure, arrhythmia, ische-mic heart disease, and diabetes has been increasingly recognized. Several radiolabeled compounds have been synthesized for noninvasive imaging, including single photon emission CT and positron emission tomography (PET). The catecholamine analogue I-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) is the most commonly used tracer for mapping of myocardial presynaptic sympathetic innervation on a broad clinical basis. In addition, radiolabeled catecholamines and catecholamine analogues are available for PET imaging, which allows absolute quantification and tracer kinetics modeling. Postsynaptic receptor PET imaging added new insights into mechanisms of heart disease. These advanced imaging techniques provide noninvasive, repeatable in vivo information of autonomic nerve function in the human heart and are promising for providing profound insights into molecular pathophysiology, monitoring of treatment, and determination of individual outcome.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16524540/
Small animal positron emission tomography in food sciences,"R Bergmann, J Pietzsch","Positron emission tomography (PET) is a 3-dimensional imaging technique that has undergone tremendous developments during the last decade. Non-invasive tracing of molecular pathways in vivo is the key capability of PET. It has become an important tool in the diagnosis of human diseases as well as in biomedical and pharmaceutical research. In contrast to other imaging modalities, radiotracer concentrations can be determined quantitatively. By application of appropriate tracer kinetic models, the rate constants of numerous different biological processes can be determined. Rapid progress in PET radiochemistry has significantly increased the number of biologically important molecules labelled with PET nuclides to target a broader range of physiologic, metabolic, and molecular pathways. Progress in PET physics and technology strongly contributed to better scanners and image processing. In this context, dedicated high resolution scanners for dynamic PET studies in small laboratory animals are now available. These developments represent the driving force for the expansion of PET methodology into new areas of life sciences including food sciences. Small animal PET has a high potential to depict physiologic processes like absorption, distribution, metabolism, elimination and interactions of biologically significant substances, including nutrients, 'nutriceuticals', functional food ingredients, and foodborne toxicants. Based on present data, potential applications of small animal PET in food sciences are discussed.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16142524/
Simultaneous estimation and segmentation from projection data in dynamic PET,"Jianan Cui, Haiqing Yu, Shuhang Chen, Yunmei Chen, Huafeng Liu","Purpose: Dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) is known for its ability to extract spatiotemporal information of a radio tracer in living tissue. Information of different functional regions based on an accurate reconstruction of the activity images and kinetic parametric images has been widely studied and can be useful in research and clinical setting for diagnosis and other quantitative tasks. In this paper, our purpose is to present a novel framework for estimating the kinetic parametric images directly from the raw measurement data together with a simultaneous segmentation accomplished through kinetic parameters clustering.

Method: An iterative framework is proposed to estimate the kinetic parameter image, activity map and do the segmentation simultaneously from the complete dynamic PET projection data. The clustering process is applied to the kinetic parameter variable rather than to the traditional activity distribution so as to achieve accurate discrimination between different functional areas. Prior information such as total variation regularization is incorporated to reduce the noise in the PET images and a sparseness constraint is integrated to guarantee the solution for kinetic parameters due to the over complete dictionary. Alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) method is used to solve the optimization problem. The proposed algorithm was validated with experiments on Monte Carlo-simulated phantoms and real patient data. Symbol error rate (SER) was defined to evaluate the performance of clustering. Bias and variance of the reconstruction activity images were calculated based on ground truth. Relative mean square error (MSE) was used to evaluate parametric results quantitatively.

Result: In brain phantom experiment, when counting rate is 1 × 106, the bias (variance) of our method is 0.1270 (0.0281), which is lower than maximum likelihood expectation maximization (MLEM) 0.1637 (0.0410) and direct estimation without segmentation (DE) 0.1511 (0.0326). In the Zubal phantom experiment, our method has the lowest bias (variance) 0.1559 (0.0354) with 1 × 105counting rate, compared with DE 0.1820 (0.0435) and MLEM 0.3043 (0.0644). As for classification, the SER of our method is 18.87% which is the lowest among MLEM + k-means, DE + k-means, and kinetic spectral clustering (KSC). Brain data with MR reference and real patient results also show that the proposed method can get images with clear structure by visual inspection.

Conclusion: In this paper, we presented a joint reconstruction framework for simultaneously estimating the activity distribution, parametric images, and parameter-based segmentation of the ROIs into different functional areas. Total variation regularization is performed on the activity distribution domain to suppress noise and preserve the edges between ROIs. An over complete dictionary for time activity curve basis is constructed. SER, bias, variance, and MSE were calculated to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30593666/
Validation of 18F-fluoro-4-thia-palmitate as a PET probe for myocardial fatty acid oxidation: effects of hypoxia and composition of exogenous fatty acids,"Timothy R DeGrado, Mehmet T Kitapci, Shuyan Wang, Jun Ying, Gary D Lopaschuk","Fatty acid oxidation (FAO) is the predominant energy-producing pathway in the healthy heart. Abnormalities in FAO are associated with many ischemic and nonischemic disease states. The aim of the present study was to further validate 16-[(18)F]-fluoro-4-thia-palmitate ((18)F-FTP) as a metabolically trapped FAO probe in the isolated perfused rat heart model by examining both the effects of hypoxia and the effects of changes in exogenous fatty acid availability.

Methods: Hearts were excised from Sprague-Dawley rats and perfused in the Langendorff mode with Krebs-Henseleit solution under the following conditions: palmitate at 0.4 mmol/L with 95% oxygen, palmitate at 0.4 mmol/L with 35% oxygen, palmitate at 0.2 mmol/L plus oleate at 0.2 mmol/L with 95% oxygen, and palmitate at 0.2 mmol/L plus oleate at 0.2 mmol/L with 35% oxygen. Hearts were paced at 270 beats per minute, and the rate of left ventricular pressure change (LV dP/dt) was monitored. (18)F-FTP in the perfusion medium was administered for 20 min, and this step was followed by a 20-min washout period without tracer in the perfusion medium. (18)F kinetics in the whole heart were monitored externally, and the time-activity curves were analyzed to determine the fractional trapping rate for (18)F-FTP (FTR(FTP)). A ""lumped constant"" (LC) was defined as the ratio of FTR(FTP) to the fractional rate of oxidation of fatty acid in the perfusion medium.

Results: The kinetic data for (18)F-FTP demonstrated metabolic trapping of (18)F radioactivity that was insensitive to changes in the mixture of fatty acids in the perfusion medium but that was sensitive to the inhibition of mitochondrial FAO by hypoxia. LV dP/dt was reduced 47%-67% in hypoxic hearts relative to hearts with normal oxygenation (controls). FAO rates for palmitate and oleate were similar in group 3 (palmitate alone) and group 4 (palmitate and oleate). FAO was decreased 70%-76% with hypoxia, whereas FTR(FTP) was reduced 86%-88%, demonstrating hypersensitivity of a change in (18)F-FTP retention to FAO inhibition by oxygen deprivation. The (18)F-FTP LC was approximately 2 in myocardium with normal oxygenation and fell to 1.0-1.2 in hypoxic myocardium.

Conclusion: The results confirm (18)F-FTP to be a metabolically trapped palmitate analog that is capable of indicating rates of myocardial oxidation of exogenous long-chain fatty acids. The heterogeneous nature of fatty acids in plasma does not alter the quantitative analysis of (18)F-FTP kinetics. However, the decreased LC value in hypoxic myocardium suggests the need to develop an understanding of the relationship of (18)F-FTP processing to natural fatty acids at key limiting transport and metabolism processes, analogous to previous studies examining the LC values for radiolabeled deoxyglucose tracers used to estimate the glucose metabolic rate.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16391202/
Sodium Multivitamin Transporter-Targeted Fluorochrome Facilitates Enhanced Metabolic Evaluation of Tumors Through Coenzyme-R Dependent Intracellular Signaling Pathways,"Feredun Azari, Gregory T Kennedy, Ashley Chang, Bilal Nadeem, Patrick Bou-Samra, Austin Chang, Alix Segil, Elizabeth Bernstein, Neil T Sullivan, Evgeniy Eruslanov, James Delikatny, Sunil Singhal","Background: Intraoperative molecular imaging (IMI)-guided resections have been shown to improve oncologic outcomes for patients undergoing surgery for solid malignancies. The technology utilizes fluorescent tracers targeting cancer cells without the use of any ionizing radiation. However, currently available targeted IMI tracers are effective only for tumors with a highly specific receptor expression profile, and there is an unmet need for IMI tracers to label a broader range of tumor types. Here, we describe the development and testing of a novel tracer (CR)-S0456) targeted to the sodium multivitamin transporter (SMVT).

Methods: Preclinical models of fibrosarcoma (HT-1080), lung (A549), breast (4T1), and renal cancers (HEK-293 T) in vitro and in vivo were used for assessment of (CR)-S0456 specific tumor labeling via sodium-mediated SMVT uptake in dipotassium phosphate or choline chloride-containing media buffer. Additionally, pharmacologic inhibition of multiple intracellular coenzyme-R obligate signaling pathways, including holocarboxylase synthetase (sulconazole nitrate), PI3K/AKT/mTOR (omipalisib), and calmodulin-dependent phosphatase (calmidazolium), were investigated to assess (CR)-S0456 uptake kinetics. Human fibrosarcoma-bearing xenografts in athymic nude mice were used for tumor and metabolic-specific labeling. Novel NIR needle confocal laser endomicroscopic (nCLE) intratumoral sampling was performed to demonstrate single-cell specific labeling by CR-S0456.

Results: CR-S0456 localization in vitro correlated with highly proliferative cell lines (MTT) and doubling time (p < 0.05) with the highest microscopic fluorescence detected in aggressive human fibrosarcomas (HT-1080). Coenzyme-R-specific localization was demonstrated to be SMVT-specific after competitive inhibition of internal localization with excess administration of pantothenic acid. Inhibiting the activity of SMVT by affecting sodium ion hemostasis prevented the complete uptake of CR-S0456. In vivo validation demonstrated (CR)-S0456 localization to xenograft models with accurate identification of primary tumors as well as margin assessment down to 1 mm3tumor volume. Systemic treatment of xenograft-bearing mice with a dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor suppressed intratumoral cell signaling and (CR)-S0456 uptake via a reduction in SMVT expression. Novel analysis of in vivo intratumoral cytologic fluorescence using near-infrared confocal laser endomicroscopy demonstrated the absence of coenzyme-R-mediated NIR fluorescence but not fibroblast activation protein (FAP)-conjugated fluorochrome, indicating specific intracellular inhibition of coenzyme-R obligate pathways.

Conclusion: These findings suggest that a SMVT-targeted NIR contrast agent can be a suitable tracer for imaging a wide range of malignancies as well as evaluating metabolic response to systemic therapies, similar to PET imaging with immune checkpoint inhibitors.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36534331/
Bringing physiology into PET of the liver,Susanne Keiding,"Several physiologic features make interpretation of PET studies of liver physiology an exciting challenge. As with other organs, hepatic tracer kinetics using PET is quantified by dynamic recording of the liver after the administration of a radioactive tracer, with measurements of time-activity curves in the blood supply. However, the liver receives blood from both the portal vein and the hepatic artery, with the peak of the portal vein time-activity curve being delayed and dispersed compared with that of the hepatic artery. The use of a flow-weighted dual-input time-activity curve is of importance for the estimation of hepatic blood perfusion through initial dynamic PET recording. The portal vein is inaccessible in humans, and methods of estimating the dual-input time-activity curve without portal vein measurements are being developed. Such methods are used to estimate regional hepatic blood perfusion, for example, by means of the initial part of a dynamic (18)F-FDG PET/CT recording. Later, steady-state hepatic metabolism can be assessed using only the arterial input, provided that neither the tracer nor its metabolites are irreversibly trapped in the prehepatic splanchnic area within the acquisition period. This is used in studies of regulation of hepatic metabolism of, for example, (18)F-FDG and (11)C-palmitate.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22323781/
Principles of cerebral perfusion imaging by bolus tracking,Leif Østergaard,"The principles of cerebral perfusion imaging by the method of dynamic susceptibility contrast magnetic resonance imaging (DSC-MRI) (bolus tracking) are described. The MRI signals underlying DSC-MRI are discussed. Tracer kinetics procedures are defined to calculate images of cerebral blood volume (CBV), cerebral blood flow (CBF), and mean transit time (MTT). Two general categories of numerical procedures are reviewed for deriving CBF from the residue function. Procedures that involve deconvolution, such as Fourier deconvolution or singular value decomposition (SVD), are classified as model-independent methods because they do not require a model of the microvascular hemodynamics. Those methods in principle also yield a measure of the tissue impulse response function and the residue function, from which microvascular hemodynamics can be characterized. The second category of methods is the model-dependent methods, which use models of tracer transport and retention in the microvasculature. These methods do not yield independent measures of the residue function and may introduce bias when the physiology does not follow the model. Statistical methods are sometimes used, which involve treating the residue function as a deconvolution kernel and optimizing (fitting) the kernel from the experimental data using procedures such as maximum likelihood. Finally, other hemodynamic indices that can be measured from DSC-MRI data are described.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16261573/
Future direction of renal positron emission tomography,"Zsolt Szabo, Jinsong Xia, William B Mathews, Phillip R Brown","Positron emission tomography (PET) is perfectly suited for quantitative imaging of the kidneys, and the recent improvements in detector technology, computer hardware, and image processing software add to its appeal. Multiple positron emitting radioisotopes can be used for renal imaging. Some, including carbon-11, nitrogen-13, and oxygen-15, can be used at institutions with an on-site cyclotron. Other radioisotopes that may be even more useful in a clinical setting are those that either can be obtained from radionuclide generators (rubidium-82, copper-62) or have a sufficiently long half-life for transportation (fluorine-18). The clinical use of functional renal PET studies (blood flow, glomerular filtration rate) has been slow, in part because of the success of concurrent technologies, including single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and planar gamma camera imaging. Renal blood flow studies can be performed with O-15-labeled water, N-13-labeled ammonia, rubidium-82, and copper-labeled PTSM. With these tracers, renal blood flow can be quantified using a modified microsphere kinetic model. Glomerular filtration can be imaged and quantified with gallium-68 EDTA or cobalt-55 EDTA. Measurements of renal blood flow with PET have potential applications in renovascular disease, in transplant rejection or acute tubular necrosis, in drug-induced nephropathies, ureteral obstruction, before and after revascularization, and before and after the placement of ureteral stents. The most important clinical application for imaging glomerular function with PET would be renovascular hypertension. Molecular imaging of the kidneys with PET is rather limited. At present, research is focused on the investigation of metabolism (acetate), membrane transporters (organic cation and anion transporters, pepT1 and pepT2, GLUT, SGLT), enzymes (ACE), and receptors (AT1R). Because many nephrological and urological disorders are initiated at the molecular and organelle levels and may remain localized at their origin for an extended period of time, new disease-specific molecular probes for PET studies of the kidneys need to be developed. Future applications of molecular renal imaging are likely to involve studies of tissue hypoxia and apoptosis in renovascular renal disease, renal cancer, and obstructive nephropathy, monitoring the molecular signatures of atherosclerotic plaques, measuring endothelial dysfunction and response to balloon revascularization and restenosis, molecular assessment of the nephrotoxic effects of cyclosporine, anticancer drugs, and radiation therapy. New radioligands will enhance the staging and follow-up of renal and prostate cancer. Methods will be developed for investigation of the kinetics of drug-delivery systems and delivery and deposition of prodrugs, reporter gene technology, delivery of gene therapy (nuclear and mitochondrial), assessment of the delivery of cellular, viral, and nonviral vectors (liposomes, polycations, fusion proteins, electroporation, hematopoietic stems cells). Of particular importance will be investigations of stem cell kinetics, including local presence, bloodborne migration, activation, seeding, and its role in renal remodeling (psychological, pathological, and therapy induced). Methods also could be established for investigating the role of receptors and oncoproteins in cellular proliferation, apoptosis, tubular atrophy, and interstitial fibrosis; monitoring ras gene targeting in kidney diseases, assessing cell therapy devices (bioartificial filters, renal tubule assist devices, and bioarticial kidneys), and targeting of signal transduction moleculas with growth factors and cytokines. These potential new approaches are, at best, in an experimental stage, and more research will be needed for their implementation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16356795/
Measurement of regional cerebral glucose utilization with fluorine-18-FDG and PET in heterogeneous tissues: theoretical considerations and practical procedure,"G Lucignani, K C Schmidt, R M Moresco, G Striano, F Colombo, L Sokoloff, F Fazio","Functional tissue heterogeneity, i.e., inclusion of tissues with different rates of blood flow and metabolism within a single region of interest, is an unavoidable problem with PET. Errors in determination of regional cerebral glucose utilization (rCMRglc) with [18F]FDG have resulted from the currently used simplifying assumption that all regions examined are homogeneous. We have established an optimal, yet practical procedure to minimize errors due to tissue heterogeneity in determination of rCMRglc. Effects of applying the three-rate constant kinetic model designed for homogeneous tissues with both dynamic and single-scan procedures and the Patlak plot were evaluated in normal subjects in experimental periods up to 120 min following tracer injection. The procedure with a single scan carried out any time within the interval between 60 and 120 min following tracer injection, combined with population average rate constants determined over a 120-min period, was found to be optimal for quantitative rCMRglc studies.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8441024/
Hepatic uptake and metabolism of galactose can be quantified in vivo by 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxygalactose positron emission tomography,"Michael Sørensen, Ole Lajord Munk, Frank Viborg Mortensen, Aage Kristian Olsen, Dirk Bender, Ludvik Bass, Susanne Keiding","Metabolism of galactose is a specialized liver function. The purpose of this PET study was to use the galactose analog 2-[(18)F]fluoro-2-deoxygalactose (FDGal) to investigate hepatic uptake and metabolism of galactose in vivo. FDGal kinetics was studied in 10 anesthetized pigs at blood concentrations of nonradioactive galactose yielding approximately first-order kinetics (tracer only; n = 4), intermediate kinetics (0.5-0.6 mmol galactose/l blood; n = 2), and near-saturation kinetics (>3 mmol galactose/l blood; n = 4). All animals underwent liver C15O PET (blood volume) and FDGal PET (galactose kinetics) with arterial and portal venous blood sampling. Flow rates in the hepatic artery and the portal vein were measured by ultrasound transit-time flowmeters. The hepatic uptake and net metabolic clearance of FDGal were quantified by nonlinear and linear regression analyses. The initial extraction fraction of FDGal from blood-to-hepatocyte was unity in all pigs. Hepatic net metabolic clearance of FDGal, K(FDGal), was 332-481 ml blood.min(-1).l(-1) tissue in experiments with approximately first-order kinetics and 15.2-21.8 ml blood.min(-1).l(-1) tissue in experiments with near-saturation kinetics. Maximal hepatic removal rates of galactose were on average 600 micromol.min(-1).l(-1) tissue (range 412-702), which was in agreement with other studies. There was no significant difference between K(FDGal) calculated with use of the dual tracer input (Kdual(FDGal)) or the single arterial input (Karterial(FDGal)). In conclusion, hepatic galactose kinetics can be quantified with the galactose analog FDGal. At near-saturated kinetics, the maximal hepatic removal rate of galactose can be calculated from the net metabolic clearance of FDGal and the blood concentration of galactose.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18483186/
Ankylosing spondylitis PET imaging and quantifications via P2X7 receptor-targeting radioligand [18F]GSK1482160,"Shiyanjin Zhang, Yifan Qiu, Lihua Huang, Lei Bi, Yuanqing Guo, Ke You, Guolong Huang, Yuhan Wang, Hai Lu, Hongjun Jin, Hong Shan","Purpose: Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the axial spine; however, the quantitative detection of inflammation in AS remains a challenge in clinical settings. We aimed to investigate the feasibility of using a specific P2X7R-targeting18F-labeled tracer [18F]GSK1482160 for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and the quantification of AS.

Methods: The radioligand [18F]GSK1482160 was obtained based on nucleophilic aliphatic substitution. Dynamic [18F]GSK1482160 and [18F]FDG micro-PET/CT imaging were performed on AS mice (n = 8) and age-matched controls (n = 8). Tracer kinetics modeling was performed using Logan's graphical arterial input function analysis to quantify the in vivo expression of P2X7R. The post-PET tissues were collected for hematoxylin-eosin (H&E), immunohistochemical (IHC), and immunofluorescence (IF) staining.

Results: [18F]GSK1482160 PET/CT imaging revealed that the specific binding in the ankle joint and sacroiliac joint (SIJ) of the AS at 8 weeks group (BPNDankle-AS-8W(non-displaceable binding potential of the ankle) 3.931 ± 0.74; BPNDSIJ-AS-8W(BPBDof the SIJ) 4.225 ± 0.84) were significantly higher than the controls at 8 weeks group (BPNDankle-Ctr-8W0.325 ± 0.15, BPNDSJJ-Ctr-8W0.319 ± 0.17) respectively, and the AS at 14 weeks group (BPNDankle-AS-14W12.212 ± 2.25; BPNDSJJ-AS-14W13.389 ± 3.60) were significantly higher than the controls at 14 weeks group (BPNDankle-Ctr-14W0.204 ± 0.16, BPNDSJJ-Ctr-14W0.655 ± 0.35) respectively. The four groups had no significant difference in the [18F]FDG uptake of ankle and SIJ. IHC and IF staining revealed that the overexpression of P2X7R was colocalized with activated macrophages from the ankle synovium and spinal endplate in mice with AS, indicating that quantification of P2X7R may contribute to the understanding of the pathogenesis of inflammation in human AS.

Conclusion: This study developed a novel P2X7R-targeting PET tracer [18F]GSK1482160 to detect the expression of P2X7R in AS mouse models and provided powerful non-invasive PET imaging and quantification for AS.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37466648/
Liver kinetics of glucose analogs measured in pigs by PET: importance of dual-input blood sampling,"O L Munk, L Bass, K Roelsgaard, D Bender, S B Hansen, S Keiding","Metabolic processes studied by PET are quantified traditionally using compartmental models, which relate the time course of the tracer concentration in tissue to that in arterial blood. For liver studies, the use of arterial input may, however, cause systematic errors to the estimated kinetic parameters, because of ignorance of the dual blood supply from the hepatic artery and the portal vein to the liver.

Methods: Six pigs underwent PET after [15O]carbon monoxide inhalation, 3-O-[11C]methylglucose (MG) injection, and [18F]FDG injection. For the glucose scans, PET data were acquired for 90 min. Hepatic arterial and portal venous blood samples and flows were measured during the scan. The dual-input function was calculated as the flow-weighted input.

Results: For both MG and FDG, the compartmental analysis using arterial input led to systematic underestimation of the rate constants for rapid blood-tissue exchange. Furthermore, the arterial input led to absurdly low estimates for the extracellular volume compared with the independently measured hepatic blood volume of 0.25 +/- 0.01 mL/mL (milliliter blood per milliliter liver tissue). In contrast, the use of a dual-input function provided parameter estimates that were in agreement with liver physiology. Using the dual-input function, the clearances into the liver cells (K1 = 1.11 +/- 0.11 mL/min/mL for MG; K1 = 1.07 +/- 0.19 mL/min/mL for FDG) were comparable with the liver blood flow (F = 1.02 +/- 0.05 mL/min/mL). As required physiologically, the extracellular volumes estimated using the dual-input function were larger than the hepatic blood volume. The linear Gjedde-Patlak analysis produced parameter estimates that were unaffected by the choice of input function, because this analysis was confined to time scales for which the arterial-input and dual-input functions were very similar.

Conclusion: Compartmental analysis of MG and FDG kinetics using dynamic PET data requires measurements of dual-input activity concentrations. Using the dual-input function, physiologically reasonable parameter estimates of K1, k2, and Vp were obtained, whereas the use of conventional arterial sampling underestimated these parameters compared with independent measurements of hepatic flow and hepatic blood volume. In contrast, the linear Gjedde-Patlak analysis, being less informative but more robust, gave similar parameter estimates (K, V) with both input functions.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11337579/
In vivo measurement of dopamine receptors in pituitary adenomas using positron emission tomography,"C Muhr, M Bergström, P O Lundberg, K Bergström, B Långström","Patients with pituitary adenomas were examined with positron emission tomography (PET) with the administration of the 11C-labelled dopamine-D2 antagonists N-methylspiperone and raclopride. The studies were repeated after protection of the D2-receptors with Haloperidol to enable a separation of specific and unspecific receptor binding. The receptor binding was evaluated by visual inspection and with the application of a kinetic model. The results showed marked specific dopamine-D2 receptor binding in the prolactinomas and minimal or no such binding in the hormonally inactive adenomas. The two tracers 11C-raclopride and 11C-N-methylspiperone showed qualitatively the same result although raclopride resulted in a higher tumor to normal brain ratio. In conclusion, PET is a valuable complement to other radiologic techniques like computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging in the evaluation of pituitary adenomas. An assessment of the dopamine-D2 receptors in the adenomas has a direct influence on the choice of treatment because adenomas with high amounts of receptors are in most cases effectively treated with dopamine agonists like bromocriptine.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2980511/
Development of a minimally invasive simultaneous estimation method for quantifying translocator protein binding with [18F]FEPPA positron emission tomography,"Praveen Dassanayake, Udunna C Anazodo, Linshan Liu, Lucas Narciso, Maryssa Iacobelli, Justin Hicks, Pablo Rusjan, Elizabeth Finger, Keith St Lawrence","Background: The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility of using a minimally invasive simultaneous estimation method (SIME) to quantify the binding of the 18-kDa translocator protein tracer [18F]FEPPA. Arterial sampling was avoided by extracting an image-derived input function (IDIF) that was metabolite-corrected using venous blood samples. The possibility of reducing scan duration to 90 min from the recommended 2-3 h was investigated by assuming a uniform non-displaceable distribution volume (VND) to simplify the SIME fitting.

Results: SIME was applied to retrospective data from healthy volunteers and was comprised of both high-affinity binders (HABs) and mixed-affinity binders (MABs). Estimates of global VNDand regional total distribution volume (VT) from SIME were not significantly different from values obtained using a two-tissue compartment model (2CTM). Regional VTestimates were greater for HABs compared to MABs for both the 2TCM and SIME, while the SIME estimates had lower inter-subject variability (41 ± 17% reduction). Binding potential (BPND) values calculated from regional VTand brain-wide VNDestimates were also greater for HABs, and reducing the scan time from 120 to 90 min had no significant effect on BPND. The feasibility of using venous metabolite correction was evaluated in a large animal model involving a simultaneous collection of arterial and venous samples. Strong linear correlations were found between venous and arterial measurements of the blood-to-plasma ratio and the remaining [18F]FEPPA fraction. Lastly, estimates of BPNDand the specific distribution volume (i.e., VS= VT- VND) from a separate group of healthy volunteers (90 min scan time, venous-scaled IDIFs) agreed with estimates from the retrospective data for both genotypes.

Conclusions: The results of this study demonstrate that accurate estimates of regional VT, BPNDand VScan be obtained by applying SIME to [18F]FEPPA data. Furthermore, the application of SIME enabled the scan time to be reduced to 90 min, and the approach worked well with IDIFs that were scaled and metabolite-corrected using venous blood samples.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36633702/
Preclinical evaluation of 18F-LMI1195 for in vivo imaging of pheochromocytoma in the MENX tumor model,"Florian C Gaertner, Tobias Wiedemann, Behrooz H Yousefi, Misu Lee, Ines Repokis, Takahiro Higuchi, Stephan G Nekolla, Ming Yu, Simon Robinson, Markus Schwaiger, Natalia S Pellegata","We evaluated (18)F-LMI1195 (1-(3-bromo-4-(3-(18)F-fluoro-propoxy)benzyl)guanidine), a metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) analog, for the detection of pheochromocytoma in a preclinical in vivo model of endogenous neuroendocrine tumors (multiple endocrine neoplasia [MENX]).

Methods: Adrenal uptake kinetics of (18)F-LMI1195 were evaluated in healthy Wistar rats (n = 6) by dynamic PET imaging. Distribution of (18)F-LMI1195 was evaluated in tumor-bearing MENX mut/mut rats (n = 10) and control MENX wild-type rats (n = 4) by biodistribution studies and PET imaging. Biodistribution of (18)F-LMI1195 was compared with (123)I-MIBG in MENX mut/mut rats (n = 6) and correlated with histological tumor volume and norepinephrine transporter (NET) expression. Uptake specificity was evaluated by in vivo inhibition of the NET by desipramine (n = 6). Intraadrenal distribution of (18)F-LMI1195 was evaluated by autoradiography.

Results: (18)F-LMI1195 showed rapid tracer accumulation in adrenal glands 1 min after tracer injection. Adrenal glands of MENX mut/mut animals showed significantly higher standardized uptake value than MENX wild-type controls (maximum SUV, 10.3 ± 2.3 vs. 6.1 ± 0.9, P < 0.01). Adrenal uptake in MENX mut/mut rats could be inhibited by desipramine, shown by biodistribution studies (0.06 ± 0.01 vs. 0.16 ± 0.05 percentage injected dose, P < 0.01), PET imaging (maximum SUV, 3.8 ± 0.8 vs. 10.3 ± 2.3, P < 0.01), and autoradiography. Adrenal uptake of (18)F-LMI1195 correlated with (123)I-MIBG uptake (r = 0.91), histological tumor volume (r = 0.68), and NET expression (r = 0.50). (18)F-LMI1195 showed an overall favorable distribution for tumor imaging.

Conclusion: (18)F-LMI1195 shows high and specific accumulation in pheochromocytomas. Its favorable biodistribution makes it a promising PET tracer for tumor imaging. Further studies are warranted to evaluate its clinical value in oncologic indications.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24136933/
Assessment of myocardial blood flow using 15O-water and 1-11C-acetate in rats with small-animal PET,"Pilar Herrero, Joonyoung Kim, Terry L Sharp, John A Engelbach, Jason S Lewis, Robert J Gropler, Michael J Welch","This feasibility study was undertaken to determine whether myocardial blood flow (MBF, mL/g/min) could be quantified noninvasively in small rodents using microPET and 15O-water or 1-11C-acetate.

Methods: MBF was measured in 18 healthy rats using PET and 15O-water (MBF-W) under different interventions and compared with direct measurements obtained with microspheres (MBF-M). Subsequently, MBF was estimated in 24 rats at rest using 1-11C-acetate (MBF-Ace) and compared with measurements obtained with 15O-water. Using factor analysis, images were processed to obtain 1 blood and 1 myocardial time-activity curve per tracer per study. MBF-W was calculated using a well-validated 1-compartment kinetic model. MBF-Ace was estimated using a simple 1-compartment model to estimate net tracer uptake, K1 (K1 (mL/g/min) = MBF.E; E = first-pass myocardial extraction of 1-11C-acetate) and washout (k2 (min(-1))) along with F(BM) (spillover correction) after fixing F(MM) (partial-volume correction) to values obtained from 15O-water modeling. K1 values were converted to MBF values using a first-pass myocardial extraction/flow relationship measured in rats (E = 1.0-0.74.exp(-1.13/MBF)).

Results: In the first study, MBF-W correlated well with MBF-M (y = 0.74x + 0.96; n = 18, r = 0.91, P < 0.0001). However, the slope was different than unity, P < 0.05). Refitting of the data after forcing the intercept to be zero resulted in a nonbias correlation between MBF-W and MBF-M (y = 0.95x + 0.0; n = 18, r = 0.86, P < 0.0001) demonstrating that the underestimation of the slope could be attributed to the overestimation of MBF-W for 2 MBF-M values lower than 1.50 mL/g/min. In the second study, MBF-Ace values correlated well with MBF-W with no underestimation of MBF (y = 0.91x + 0.35; n = 24, r = 0.87, P < 0.0001).

Conclusion: MBF can be quantified by PET using (15)O-water or 1-11C-acetate in healthy rats. Future studies are needed to determine the accuracy of the methods in low-flow states and to develop an approach for a partial-volume correction when 1-11C-acetate is used.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16513617/
Parametric mapping of binding in human brain of D2 receptor ligands of different affinities,"Thomas Siessmeier, Yun Zhou, Hans-Georg Buchholz, Christian Landvogt, Ingo Vernaleken, Markus Piel, Ralf Schirrmacher, Frank Rösch, Mathias Schreckenberger, Dean F Wong, Paul Cumming, Gerhard Gründer, Peter Bartenstein","(11)C-Raclopride has been widely used for PET studies of dopamine D(2/3) receptors in human brain. The long half-life of (18)F may impart advantages to the novel moderate-affinity benzamide (18)F-desmethoxyfallypride and its high-affinity congener (18)F-fallypride for competition studies and for detection of extrastriatal binding. However, the in vivo kinetics of these compounds and the quantification approaches for parametric mapping of their specific bindings have not been systematically compared.

Methods: Dynamic emission recordings of the 3 tracers were obtained in groups of healthy subjects. A conventional model, graphical analysis using metabolite-corrected arterial inputs, and models with reference tissue inputs were used to calculate voxelwise parametric maps of the equilibrium distribution volume (V(d)) and the binding potential (BP) of the 3 radioligands in brain. To test for bias, voxelwise kinetic results were compared with those obtained by volume-of-interest (VOI) analysis.

Results: The V(d) and BP estimates obtained by VOI analysis did not differ from the mean of voxelwise estimates in the same striatal volumes. In striatum, the mean (18)F-desmethoxyfallypride BP ranged from 1.9 to 2.5, whereas the mean (11)C-raclopride BP ranged from 3 to 4, depending on the method used for calculation. In contrast, the mean BP of (18)F-fallypride ranged from 16 to 27 in striatum and could also be readily quantified in the thalamus.

Conclusion: Reference tissue methods for the voxelwise calculation of binding parameters are suitable for parametric mapping of the 3 dopamine D(2/3) receptor ligands.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15937307/
Perspective: Solving the Heterogeneity Conundrum of TSPO PET Imaging in Psychosis,"Livia De Picker, Manuel Morrens","Positron emission tomography using ligands targeting translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO PET) is an innovative method to visualize and quantify glial inflammatory responses in the central nervous systemin vivo. Compared to some other neuropsychiatric disorders, findings of TSPO PET in schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders have been considerably more heterogeneous. Two conflicting meta-analyses have been published on the topic within the last year: one asserting evidence for decreased TSPO uptake, while the other observed increased TSPO uptake in a selection of studies. In this paper, we review and discuss five hypotheses which may explain the observed variability of TSPO PET findings in psychotic illness, namely that (1) an inflammatory phenotype is only present in a subgroup of psychosis patients; (2) heterogeneity is caused by interference of antipsychotic medication; (3) interference of other clinical confounders in the study populations (such as age, sex, BMI, smoking, and substance use); or (4) methodological variability between studies (such as choice of tracer and kinetic model, genotyping, study power, and diurnal effects); and (5) the glial responses underlying changes in TSPO expression are themselves heterogeneous and dynamic. Finally, we propose four key recommendations for future research proposals to mitigate these different causes of heterogeneity.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32425835/
Rapid computation of single PET scan rest-stress myocardial blood flow parametric images by table look up,"Nicolas J Guehl, Marc D Normandin, Dustin W Wooten, Guy Rozen, Jeremy N Ruskin, Timothy M Shoup, Jonghye Woo, Leon M Ptaszek, Georges El Fakhri, Nathaniel M Alpert","Purpose: We have recently reported a method for measuring rest-stress myocardial blood flow (MBF) using a single, relatively short, PET scan session. The method requires two IV tracer injections, one to initiate rest imaging and one at peak stress. We previously validated absolute flow quantitation in ml/min/cc for standard bull's eye, segmental analysis. In this work, we extend the method for fast computation of rest-stress MBF parametric images.

Methods: We provide an analytic solution to the single-scan rest-stress flow model which is then solved using a two-dimensional table lookup method (LM). Simulations were performed to compare the accuracy and precision of the lookup method with the original nonlinear method (NLM). Then the method was applied to 16 single scan rest/stress measurements made in 12 pigs: seven studied after infarction of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) territory, and nine imaged in the native state. Parametric maps of rest and stress MBF as well as maps of left (fLV) and right (fRV) ventricular spill-over fractions were generated. Regions of interest (ROIs) for 17 myocardial segments were defined in bull's eye fashion on the parametric maps. The mean of each ROI was then compared to the rest (K1r) and stress (K1s) MBF estimates obtained from fitting the 17 regional TACs with the NLM.

Results: In simulation, the LM performed as well as the NLM in terms of precision and accuracy. The simulation did not show that bias was introduced by the use of a predefined two-dimensional lookup table. In experimental data, parametric maps demonstrated good statistical quality and the LM was computationally much more efficient than the original NLM. Very good agreement was obtained between the mean MBF calculated on the parametric maps for each of the 17 ROIs and the regional MBF values estimated by the NLM (K1mapLM= 1.019 × K1ROINLM+ 0.019, R2= 0.986; mean difference = 0.034 ± 0.036 mL/min/cc).

Conclusions: We developed a table lookup method for fast computation of parametric imaging of rest and stress MBF. Our results show the feasibility of obtaining good quality MBF maps using modest computational resources, thus demonstrating that the method can be applied in a clinical environment to obtain full quantitative MBF information.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28594441/
"Brivaracetam, a selective high-affinity synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A) ligand with preclinical evidence of high brain permeability and fast onset of action","Jean-Marie Nicolas, Jonas Hannestad, Daniel Holden, Sophie Kervyn, Nabeel Nabulsi, Dominique Tytgat, Yiyun Huang, Hugues Chanteux, Ludovicus Staelens, Alain Matagne, François-Xavier Mathy, Joël Mercier, Armel Stockis, Richard E Carson, Henrik Klitgaard","Objective: Rapid distribution to the brain is a prerequisite for antiepileptic drugs used for treatment of acute seizures. The preclinical studies described here investigated the high-affinity synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A) antiepileptic drug brivara-cetam (BRV) for its rate of brain penetration and its onset of action. BRV was compared with levetiracetam (LEV).

Methods: In vitro permeation studies were performed using Caco-2 cells. Plasma and brain levels were measured over time after single oral dosing to audiogenic mice and were correlated with anticonvulsant activity. Tissue distribution was investigated after single dosing to rat (BRV and LEV) and dog (LEV only). Positron emission tomography (PET) displacement studies were performed in rhesus monkeys using the SV2A PET tracer [11C]UCB-J. The time course of PET tracer displacement was measured following single intravenous (IV) dosing with LEV or BRV. Rodent distribution data and physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling were used to compute blood-brain barrier permeability (permeability surface area product, PS) values and then predict brain kinetics in man.

Results: In rodents, BRV consistently showed a faster entry into the brain than LEV; this correlated with a faster onset of action against seizures in audiogenic susceptible mice. The higher permeability of BRV was also demonstrated in human cells in vitro. PBPK modeling predicted that, following IV dosing to human subjects, BRV might distribute to the brain within a few minutes compared with approximately 1 h for LEV (PS of 0.315 and 0.015 ml/min/g for BRV and LEV, respectively). These data were supported by a nonhuman primate PET study showing faster SV2A occupancy by BRV compared with LEV.

Significance: These preclinical data demonstrate that BRV has rapid brain entry and fast brain SV2A occupancy, consistent with the fast onset of action in the audiogenic seizure mice assay. The potential benefit of BRV for treatment of acute seizures remains to be confirmed in clinical studies.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26663401/

Rodent distribution data and physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling were used to compute blood-brain barrier permeability (permeability surface area product, PS) values and then predict brain kinetics in man.

Results: In rodents, BRV consistently showed a faster entry into the brain than LEV; this correlated with a faster onset of action against seizures in audiogenic susceptible mice. The higher permeability of BRV was also demonstrated in human cells in vitro. PBPK modeling predicted that, following IV dosing to human subjects, BRV might distribute to the brain within a few minutes compared with approximately 1 h for LEV (PS of 0.315 and 0.015 ml/min/g for BRV and LEV, respectively). These data were supported by a nonhuman primate PET study showing faster SV2A occupancy by BRV compared with LEV.

Significance: These preclinical data demonstrate that BRV has rapid brain entry and fast brain SV2A occupancy, consistent with the fast onset of action in the audiogenic seizure mice assay. The potential benefit of BRV for treatment of acute seizures remains to be confirmed in clinical studies.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26663401/
Tumor imaging using 1-(2'-deoxy-2'-18F-fluoro-beta-D-arabinofuranosyl)thymine and PET,"Omid S Tehrani, Otto Muzik, Lance K Heilbrun, Kirk A Douglas, Jawana M Lawhorn-Crews, Haihao Sun, Thomas J Mangner, Anthony F Shields","The kinetics of 1-(2'-deoxy-2'-fluoro-beta-d-arabinofuranosyl)thymine (FMAU) were studied using PET to determine the most appropriate and simplest approach to image acquisition and analysis. The concept of tumor retention ratio (TRR) is introduced and validated.

Methods: Ten patients with brain (n = 4) or prostate (n = 6) tumors were imaged using (18)F-FMAU PET (mean dose, 369 MBq). Sixty-minute dynamic images were obtained; this was followed by whole-body images. Mean and maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmean and SUVmax, respectively) of each tumor were determined as the mean over 3 planes of each time interval. For kinetic analyses, blood activity was measured in 18 samples over 60 min. Samples were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography at 3 selected times to determine tracer metabolites. FMAU kinetics were measured using a 3-compartment model yielding the flux (K1 x k3/(k2 + k3)) (K1, k2, and k3 are rate constants) and compared with TRR measurements. TRR was calculated as the tumor (18)F-FMAU uptake area under the curve divided by the product of blood (18)F-FMAU AUC and time. A similar analysis was performed using muscle to estimate (18)F-FMAU delivery.

Results: SUVmean measurements obtained from 5 to 11 min correlated with those obtained from 30 to 60 min (r(2) = 0.92, P < 0.0001) and 50 to 60 min (r(2) = 0.92, P < 0.0001) due to the rapid clearance of (18)F-FMAU. Similar results were obtained using SUVmax measurements (r(2) = 0.93, P < 0.0001; r(2) = 0.88, P < 0.0001, respectively). The measurement of TRR using either blood or muscle activity over 11 min provided results comparable to those of 60-min dynamic imaging and a 3-compartment model. This analysis required only 5 blood samples drawn at 1, 2, 3, 5, and 11 min without metabolite correction to produce comparable results.

Conclusion: Tissue retention ratio measurements obtained over 11 min can replace flux measurements in (18)F-FMAU imaging. The SUVmean and the SUVmax in 5-11 min images correlated well with those of images obtained at 50-60 min. The quality of the images and tissue kinetics in 11 min of imaging makes it a desirable and shorter tumor imaging option.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17785728/
Specific beta-adrenergic receptor binding of carazolol measured with PET,"M S Berridge, A D Nelson, L Zheng, G P Leisure, F Miraldi","Carazolol is a promising high-affinity beta-adrenergic receptor ligand for the noninvasive determination of beta receptor status using PET. Earlier investigations demonstrated specific receptor binding of carazolol in mice. These PET studies with S(-)-[2""-11C]carazolol in pigs were performed to explore the utility of the tracer for PET receptor studies.

Methods: Tracer uptake in the heart and lung was measured by PET as a function of time. Receptors were blocked with propranolol and different doses of ICI 118,551 to estimate specific binding. Fluorine-18-1""-Fluorocarazolol and the less active R-enantiomer of [11C]-carazolol were also studied.

Results: Specific receptor binding was 75% of the total uptake in the heart, preventable and displaceable by propranolol. Dose-dependent competition showed that carazolol binds in vivo to beta 1 and to beta 2 subtypes. Uptake of the labeled R(+) enantiomer of carazolol was not receptor-specific.

Conclusions: Carazolol labeled with 11C or 18F is a strong candidate for use in receptor estimation with PET. The in vivo observations were consistent with its known high affinity and slow receptor dissociation rate. Its high specific receptor uptake and low metabolism allow existing kinetic models to be applied for receptor measurements. The 11C label is convenient for repeated administrations, though 18F allowed the long observation periods necessary for measurement of the receptor dissociation rate. If needed, nonspecific uptake can be estimated without pharmacologic intervention by using the labeled R enantiomer.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7931670/
Impact of an Adenosine A2A Receptor Agonist and Antagonist on Binding of the Dopamine D2 Receptor Ligand [11C]raclopride in the Rodent Striatum,"Kavya Prasad, Erik F J de Vries, Jürgen W A Sijbesma, Lara Garcia-Varela, Daniel A Vazquez-Matias, Rodrigo Moraga-Amaro, Antoon T M Willemsen, Rudi A J O Dierckx, Aren van Waarde","Adenosine A2Aand dopamine D2receptors in the basal ganglia form heterotetrameric structures that are involved in the regulation of motor activity and neuropsychiatric functions. The present study examines the A2Areceptor-mediated modulation of D2receptor binding in vivo using positron emission tomography (PET) with the D2antagonist tracer [11C]raclopride. Healthy male Wistar rats (n= 8) were scanned (60 min dynamic scan) with [11C]raclopride at baseline and 7 days later following an acute administration of the A2Aagonist CGS21680 (1 mg/kg), using a MicroPET Focus-220 camera. Nondisplaceable binding potential (BPND) values were calculated using a simplified reference tissue model (SRTM), with cerebellum as the reference tissue. SRTM analysis did not show any significant changes in [11C]raclopride BPND(p= 0.102) in striatum after CGS21680 administration compared to the baseline. As CGS21680 strongly affects hemodynamics, we also used arterial blood sampling and a metabolite-corrected plasma input function for compartment modeling using the reversible two-tissue compartment model (2TCM) to obtain the BPNDfrom thek3/k4ratio and from the striatum/cerebellum volume of distribution ratio (DVR) in a second group of animals. These rats underwent dynamic [11C]raclopride scans after pretreatment with a vehicle (n= 5), a single dose of CGS21680 (1 mg/kg,n= 5), or a single dose of the A2Aantagonist KW6002 (1 mg/kg,n= 5). The parent fraction in plasma was significantly higher in the CGS21680-treated group (p= 0.0001) compared to the vehicle-treated group. GCS21680 administration significantly reduced the striatalk3/k4ratio (p< 0.01), butk3andk4estimates may be less reliable. The BPND(DVR-1) decreased from 1.963 ± 0.27 in the vehicle-treated group to 1.53 ± 0.55 (p= 0.080) or 1.961 ± 0.11 (p= 0.993) after the administration of CGS21680 or KW6002, respectively. Our study suggests that the A2Aagonist CGS21680, but not the antagonist KW6002, may reduce the D2receptor availability in the striatum.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35849844/
A Factor-Image Framework to Quantification of Brain Receptor Dynamic PET Studies,"Z Jane Wang, Zsolt Szabo, Peng Lei, József Varga, K J Ray Liu","The positron emission tomography (PET) imaging technique enables the measurement of receptor distribution or neurotransmitter release in the living brain and the changes of the distribution with time and thus allows quantification of binding sites as well as the affinity of a radioligand. However, quantification of receptor binding studies obtained with PET is complicated by tissue heterogeneity in the sampling image elements (i.e., voxels, pixels). This effect is caused by a limited spatial resolution of the PET scanner. Spatial heterogeneity is often essential in understanding the underlying receptor binding process. Tracer kinetic modeling also often requires an intrusive collection of arterial blood samples. In this paper, we propose a likelihood-based framework in the voxel domain for quantitative imaging with or without the blood sampling of the input function. Radioligand kinetic parameters are estimated together with the input function. The parameters are initialized by a subspace-based algorithm and further refined by an iterative likelihood-based estimation procedure. The performance of the proposed scheme is examined by simulations. The results show that the proposed scheme provides reliable estimation of factor time-activity curves (TACs) and the underlying parametric images. A good match is noted between the result of the proposed approach and that of the Logan plot. Real brain PET data are also examined, and good performance is observed in determining the TACs and the underlying factor images.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18769527/
Comparison of microsphere-equivalent blood flow (15O-water PET) and relative perfusion (99mTc-tetrofosmin SPECT) in myocardium showing metabolism-perfusion mismatch,"Wolfgang M Schaefer, Bernd Nowak, Hans-Juergen Kaiser, Karl-Christian Koch, Stephan Block, Juergen vom Dahl, Udalrich Buell","Myocardial perfusion imaging with (99m)Tc-tetrofosmin is based on the assumption of a linear correlation between myocardial blood flow (MBF) and tracer uptake. However, it is known that (99m)Tc-tetrofosmin uptake is directly related to energy-dependent transport processes, such as Na(+)/H(+) ion channel activity, as well as cellular and mitochondrial membrane potentials. Therefore, cellular alterations that affect these energy-dependent transport processes ought to influence (99m)Tc-tetrofosmin uptake independently of blood flow. Because metabolism ((18)F-FDG)-perfusion ((99m)Tc-tetrofosmin) mismatch myocardium (MPMM) reflects impaired but viable myocardium showing cellular alterations, MPMM was chosen to quantify the blood flow-independent effect of cellular alterations on (99m)Tc-tetrofosmin uptake. Therefore, we compared microsphere-equivalent MBF (MBF_micr; (15)O-water PET) and (99m)Tc-tetrofosmin uptake in MPMM and in ""normal"" myocardium.

Methods: Forty-two patients with severe coronary artery disease, referred for myocardial viability diagnostics, were examined using (18)F-FDG PET and (99m)Tc-tetrofosmin perfusion SPECT. Relative (18)F-FDG and (99m)Tc-tetrofosmin uptake values were calculated using 18 segments per patient. Normal myocardium and MPMM myocardium were classified using a previously validated (99m)Tc-tetrofosmin SPECT/(18)F-FDG PET score. In addition, (15)O-water PET was performed to assess kinetic-modeled MBF (MBF_kin), the water-perfusable tissue fraction (PTF), and the resulting MBF_micr (MBF_kin x PTF), which is comparable to tracer uptake values. (99m)Tc-tetrofosmin uptake and MBF_micr values were calculated for all normal and MPMM segments and averaged within their respective classifications.

Results: Mean relative (99m)Tc-tetrofosmin uptake was 86% +/- 1% in normal myocardium and 56% +/- 1% in MPMM, showing a significant difference (P < 0.001), as was expected from the classification. Contrary to these findings, mean MBF_micr in MPMM myocardium was 0.60 +/- 0.03 mL x min(-1) x mL(-1), which did not significantly differ from normal myocardium (0.64 +/- 0.01 mL x min(-1) x mL(-1)). All values are given as mean +/- SEM.

Conclusion: Differences between reduced (99m)Tc-tetrofosmin uptake and the unchanged MBF_micr in MPMM myocardium suggest that the pathophysiologic basis of MPMM is not a blood flow reduction but cellular alterations that affect uptake and retention of (99m)Tc-tetrofosmin independently of blood flow. Therefore, it seems that perfusion deficits in MPMM myocardium are greatly overestimated by (99m)Tc-tetrofosmin and that it tends to give false-positive findings.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12515874/
PET-determined myocardial perfusion and flow in coronary artery disease characterization,"Ines Valenta, Thomas H Schindler","Positron emission tomography (PET) myocardial perfusion imaging in conjunction with tracer-kinetic modeling enables the concurrent assessment of myocardial perfusion and regional myocardial blood flow (MBF) of the left ventricle in absolute terms in milliliters per gram per minute (mL/g/min). The non-invasive quantification of MBF during pharmacologically induced hyperemia, at rest, and corresponding myocardial flow reserve (MFR) opens a new avenue for the identification and characterization of classical or endogen type of coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD) as functional substrate for microvascular angina in patients with non-obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) and/or no CAD at all. Further, PET-MBF quantification expands the scope of conventional myocardial perfusion imaging from the identification of advanced, and flow-limiting, epicardial CAD to early stages of atherosclerosis and/or CMD. Adding MBF assessment to myocardial perfusion may also reliably unravel diffuse ischemia owing to significant left main stenosis and/or multivessel CAD, commonly confirmed by peak stress transient ischemic cavity dilation of the left ventricle during maximal vasomotor stress compared to rest on gated PET images. Owing to high spatial and contrast resolution in conjunction with photon-attenuation free myocardial perfusion PET images, PET is preferentially used for CAD detection in advanced obesity and women with pronounced breast habitus. With increasing clinical use of cardiac PET perfusion and MBF assessment, individualized, and image-guided cardiovascular treatment decisions in CAD patients is likely to ensue, while its translation into improved cardiovascular outcome remains to be investigated.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38403519/
(18)F-FBPA as a tumor specific tracer of L-type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1): PET evaluation in tumor and inflammation compared to (18)F-FDG and (11)C-methionine,"Tadashi Watabe, Jun Hatazawa","Objective: (18)F-FDG-PET is used worldwide for oncology patients. However, we sometimes encounter false positive cases of (18)F-FDG PET, such as moderate uptake in the inflammatory lesion, because (18)F-FDG accumulates not only in the cancer cells but also in the inflammatory cells (macrophage, granulation tissue, etc). To overcome this limitation of (18)F-FDG, we started to use (4-borono-2- [(18)F]fluoro-L-phenylalanine) (18)F-FBPA, an artificial amino acid tracer which is focusing attention as a tumor specific PET tracer. Physiological accumulation of (18)F-FBPA is limited in the kidney and urinary tract in humans, which enable preferable evaluation of uptake in the abdominal organs compared to (11)C-methionine ((11)C-MET). The purpose of this study was to evaluate (18)F-FBPA as a tumor specific tracer by in vitro cellular uptake analysis focusing on the selectivity of L-type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1), which is specifically expressed in tumor cells, and in vivo PET analysis in rat xenograft and inflammation models compared to (18)F-FDG and (11)C-methionine.

Subjects and methods: Uptake inhibition and efflux experiments were performed in HEK293-LAT1 and LAT2 cells using cold BPA, cold (18)F-FBPA, and hot (18)F-FBPA to evaluate LAT affinity and transport capacity. Position emission tomography studies were performed in rat xenograft model of C6 glioma 2 weeks after the implantation (n=9, body weight=197±10.5g) and subcutaneous inflammation model 4 days after the injection of turpentine oil (n=9, body weight=197±14.4g). Uptake on static PET images were compared among (18)F-FBPA at 60-70min post injection, (18)F-FDG at 60-70min, and (11)C-MET at 20-30min in the tumors and the inflammatory lesions by maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax).

Results: Cellular uptake analysis showed no significant difference in inhibitory effect and efflux of LAT1 between cold (18)F-FBPA and cold BPA, suggesting the same affinity and transport capacity via LAT1. Uptake of (18)F-FBPA via LAT1 was superior to LAT2 by the concentration dependent uptake analysis. Position emission tomography analysis using SUVmax showed significantly higher accumulation of (18)F-FDG in the tumor and the inflammatory lesions (7.19±2.11 and 4.66±0.63, respectively) compared to (18)F-FBPA (3.23±0.40 and 1.86±0.19, respectively) and (11)C-MET (3.39±0.43 and 1.63±0.11, respectively) (P<0.01 by Tukey test). No significant difference was observed between (18)F-FBPA and (11)C-MET.

Conclusions: (18)F-FBPA showed high selectivity of LAT1 by in vitro cellular uptake analysis, suggesting the potential as a tumor-specific substrate. In vivo PET analysis showed significantly lower uptake of (18)F-FBPA and (11)C-MET in the inflammatory lesions compared to (18)F-FDG, suggesting comparable utility of (18)F-FBPA PET to (11)C-MET PET in differentiating between the tumor and the inflammation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26665232/
The kinetics of 18F-FDG in lung cancer: compartmental models and voxel analysis,"Erica Silvestri, Valentina Scolozzi, Gaia Rizzo, Luca Indovina, Marco Castellaro, Maria Vittoria Mattoli, Paolo Graziano, Giuseppe Cardillo, Alessandra Bertoldo, Maria Lucia Calcagni","Background: The validation of the most appropriate compartmental model that describes the kinetics of a specific tracer within a specific tissue is mandatory before estimating quantitative parameters, since the behaviour of a tracer can be different among organs and diseases, as well as between primary tumours and metastases. The aims of our study were to assess which compartmental model better describes the kinetics of18F-Fluorodeoxygluxose(18F-FDG) in primary lung cancers and in metastatic lymph nodes; to evaluate whether quantitative parameters, estimated using different innovative technologies, are different between lung cancers and lymph nodes; and to evaluate the intra-tumour inhomogeneity.

Results: Twenty-one patients (7 females; 71 ± 9.4 years) with histologically proved lung cancer, prospectively evaluated, underwent18F-FDG PET-CT for staging. Spectral analysis iterative filter (SAIF) method was used to design the most appropriate compartmental model. Among the compartmental models arranged using the number of compartments suggested by SAIF results, the best one was selected according to Akaike information criterion (AIC). Quantitative analysis was performed at the voxel level. K1, Vband Kiwere estimated with three advanced methods: SAIF approach, Patlak analysis and the selected compartmental model. Pearson's correlation and non-parametric tests were used for statistics. SAIF showed three possible irreversible compartmental models: Tr-1R, Tr-2R and Tr-3R. According to well-known18F-FDG physiology, the structure of the compartmental models was supposed to be catenary. AIC indicated the Sokoloff's compartmental model (3K) as the best one. Excellent correlation was found between Kiestimated by Patlak and by SAIF (R2= 0.97, R2= 0.94, at the global and the voxel level respectively), and between Kiestimated by 3K and by SAIF (R2= 0.98, R2= 0.95, at the global and the voxel level respectively). Using the 3K model, the lymph nodes showed higher mean and standard deviation of Vbthan lung cancers (p < 0.0014, p < 0.0001 respectively) and higher standard deviation of K1(p < 0.005).

Conclusions: One-tissue reversible plus one-tissue irreversible compartmental model better describes the kinetics of18F-FDG in lung cancers, metastatic lymph nodes and normal lung tissues. Quantitative parameters, estimated at the voxel level applying different advanced approaches, show the inhomogeneity of neoplastic tissues. Differences in metabolic activity and in vascularization, highlighted among all cancers and within each individual cancer, confirm the wide variability in lung cancers and metastatic lymph nodes. These findings support the need of a personalization of therapeutic approaches.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30159686/
Impact of obesity and bariatric surgery on metabolism and coronary circulatory function,"Ines Valenta, Vasken Dilsizian, Alessandra Quercioli, Freimut D Jüngling, Giuseppe Ambrosio, Richard Wahl, Thomas H Schindler","Increases in intra-abdominal visceral adipose tissue have been widely appreciated as a risk factor for metabolic disorders such as dyslipidemia, hypertension, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes, whereas this is not the case for peripheral or subcutaneous obesity. While the underlying mechanisms that contribute to these differences in adipose tissue activity remain uncertain, increases in visceral fat commonly induce metabolic dysregulation, in part because of increased venous effluent of fatty acids and/or adipokines/cytokines to the liver. Increased body weight, paralleled by an increase in plasma markers of the insulin-resistance syndrome and chronic inflammation, is independently associated with coronary circulatory dysfunction. Recent data suggest that plasma proteins originating from the adipose tissue, such as endocannabinoids (EC), leptin, and adiponectin (termed adipocytes) play a central role in the regulation and control of coronary circulatory function in obesity. Positron emission tomography (PET) in concert with tracer kinetic modeling is a well established technique for quantifying regional myocardial blood flow at rest and in response to various forms of vasomotor stress. Myocardial flow reserve assessed by PET provides a noninvasive surrogate of coronary circulatory function. PET also enables the monitoring and characterization of coronary circulatory function in response to gastric bypass-induced weight loss in initially morbidly obese individuals, to medication and/or behavioral interventions related to weight, diet, and physical activity. Whether the observed improvement in coronary circulatory dysfunction via weight loss may translate to diminution in cardiovascular events awaits clinical confirmation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24281976/
"The influence of insulin resistance, obesity, and diabetes mellitus on vascular tone and myocardial blood flow","Ines Valenta, Vasken Dilsizian, Alessandra Quercioli, Heinrich R Schelbert, Thomas H Schindler","Among individuals with cardiovascular risk factors, reductions in coronary vasodilator capacity with or without diabetes mellitus (DM) carry important diagnostic and prognostic information. Positron emission tomography (PET) myocardial perfusion imaging in concert with tracer kinetic modeling allows the assessment of absolute regional myocardial blood flow (MBF) at rest and its response to various forms of vasomotor stress. Such noninvasive evaluation of myocardial flow reserve (MFR) or the vasodilator capacity of the coronary circulation expands the possibilities of conventional scintigraphic myocardial perfusion imaging from identifying flow-limiting epicardial coronary artery lesions to understanding the underlying pathophysiology of diabetic vasculopathy, microcirculatory dysfunction, and its atherothrombotic sequelae. Invaluable mechanistic insights were recently reported with PET by unraveling important effects of insulin resistance, obesity, and DM on the function of the coronary circulation. Such noninvasive assessment of coronary circulatory dysfunction enables monitoring its response to antidiabetic medication and/or behavioral interventions related to weight, diet, and physical activity that may evolve as a promising tool for an image-guided and personalized preventive diabetic vascular care. Whether PET-guided improvement or normalization of hyperemic MBF and/or MFR will translate into improved patient outcome in DM is a laudable goal to pursue next.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22205177/
Novel application of complementary imaging techniques to examine in vivo glucose metabolism in the kidney,"Takashi Hato, Allon N Friedman, Henry Mang, Zoya Plotkin, Shataakshi Dube, Gary D Hutchins, Paul R Territo, Brian P McCarthy, Amanda A Riley, Kumar Pichumani, Craig R Malloy, Robert A Harris, Pierre C Dagher, Timothy A Sutton","The metabolic status of the kidney is a determinant of injury susceptibility and a measure of progression for many disease processes; however, noninvasive modalities to assess kidney metabolism are lacking. In this study, we employed positron emission tomography (PET) and intravital multiphoton microscopy (MPM) to assess cortical and proximal tubule glucose tracer uptake, respectively, following experimental perturbations of kidney metabolism. Applying dynamic image acquisition PET with 2-18fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (18F-FDG) and tracer kinetic modeling, we found that an intracellular compartment in the cortex of the kidney could be distinguished from the blood and urine compartments in animals. Given emerging literature that the tumor suppressor protein p53 is an important regulator of cellular metabolism, we demonstrated that PET imaging was able to discern a threefold increase in cortical18F-FDG uptake following the pharmacological inhibition of p53 in animals. Intravital MPM with the fluorescent glucose analog 2-[N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino]-2-deoxyglucose (2-NBDG) provided increased resolution and corroborated these findings at the level of the proximal tubule. Extending our observation of p53 inhibition on proximal tubule glucose tracer uptake, we demonstrated by intravital MPM that pharmacological inhibition of p53 diminishes mitochondrial potential difference. We provide additional evidence that inhibition of p53 alters key metabolic enzymes regulating glycolysis and increases intermediates of glycolysis. In summary, we provide evidence that PET is a valuable tool for examining kidney metabolism in preclinical and clinical studies, intravital MPM is a powerful adjunct to PET in preclinical studies of metabolism, and p53 inhibition alters basal kidney metabolism.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26764206/
Preliminary evaluation of [1-11C]octanoate as a PET tracer for studying cerebral ischemia: a PET study in rat and canine models of focal cerebral ischemia,"Y Kuge, H Kawashima, T Hashimoto, M Imanishi, M Shiomi, K Minematsu, Y Hasegawa, T Yamaguchi, Y Miyake, N Hashimoto","Octanoate is taken up into the brain and is converted in astrocytes to glutamine through the TCA cycle after beta-oxidation. We speculate that [1-11C]octanoate may be used as a tracer for astroglial functions and/or fatty acid metabolism in the brain and may be useful for studying cerebral ischemia. In the present study we investigated brain distribution of [1-11C]octanoate and compared it with cerebral blood flow (CBF) by using rat and canine models of middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion and a high resolution PET. In rats brain distribution of [15O]H2O measured 1-2 h and 5-6 h after insult was compared with that of [1-11C]octanoate measured 3-4 h after insult. Radioactivity ratios of lesioned to normal hemispheres determined with [15O]H2O were lower than those determined with [1-11C]octanoate. These results were confirmed by a study on a canine model of MCA-occlusion. Twenty-four hours after insult, CBF decreased in the MCA-territory of the occluded hemisphere, whereas normal or higher accumulation of [1-11C]octanoate was observed in the ischemic regions. The uptake of [1-11C]octanoate-derived radioactivity therefore increased relative to CBF in the ischemic regions, indicating that [1-11C]octanoate provides functional information different from CBF. In conclusion, we found that [1-11C]octanoate is a potential radiopharmaceutical for studying the pathophysiology of cerebral ischemia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10770584/
PET imaging of the anticancer drug candidate [11C]trimebutine in a rat glioma model,"Jia-Zhe Lin, Maria Kominia, Janine Doorduin, Erik F J de Vries","Purpose: Preclinical studies suggest that trimebutine could be a potential treatment for glioblastoma. The aim of this study was to investigate the distribution, kinetics and tumor accumulation of [11C]trimebutine.

Method: A proliferation assay and cell scratch healing assay were performed to confirm the antitumor effects of trimebutine on C6 glioma cells in-vitro. Trimebutine was subsequently labeled with11C. The distribution and kinetics of [11C]trimebutine in health rats and rats with an orthotopic C6 glioma were evaluated by ex-vivo gamma counting and positron emission tomography, respectively. Blocking experiments with an excess of unlabeled trimebutine or the μ-opioid receptor ligand cyprodime were employed to determine if trimebutine exhibits saturable binding in the brain. In addition, plasma stability of the tracer was assessed.

Results: The proliferation assay and cell scratch healing assay confirmed that trimebutine has anti-tumor effects in-vitro. [11C]Trimebutine with a radiochemical purity >98 % was synthesized in 15 ± 5 % radiochemical yield. In peripheral organs, the highest accumulation of the tracer was detected in excretion organs. In the brain, the highest tracer uptake was observed in the brainstem and the lowest in the hypothalamus, although differences between regions were small. PET imaging showed rapid brain uptake of [11C]trimebutine, followed by a gradual washout. Administration of an intravenous dose of trimebutine (10 mg/kg) significantly decreased the uptake in all brain regions (p < 0.05), except midbrain. Likewise, administration of cyprodime (2 mg/kg) significantly reduced [11C]trimebutine uptake in the brain (p < 0.01). However, uptake of [11C]trimebutine in the tumor was not significantly different from its brain uptake in rats bearing an orthotopic C6 glioma. The percentage of intact [11C]trimebutine at 60 min post injection was only 1.7 ± 0.6 %.

Conclusion: Trimebutine exhibits inhibitory effects on the growth and migration of glioma cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. [11C]Trimebutine was able to penetrate the blood-brain barrier in rats and tracer uptake could be significantly reduced by administration of a μ-opioid receptor antagonist. However, [11C]trimebutine failed to selectively accumulate in orthotopic C6 glioma, which could be caused by low expression levels of the drug target in these tumors, or by fast metabolism of the tracer.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39662136/
[Kinetic analysis of glucose metabolism in meningiomas--comparison with malignant gliomas],"H Shioya, K Mineura, T Sasajima, M Kowada, H Iida, T Ogawa, J Hatazawa, K Uemura","We measured kinetic rate constants and glucose metabolic rate (kinetic-rCMRGl) using dynamic positron emission tomography (PET), as well as regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), blood volume (rCBV), oxygen extraction fraction (rOEF), oxygen metabolic rate (rCMRO2) and autoradiographic rCMRGl (arg-rCMRGl), in patients with meningioma. Ten patients including one recurrent case, two males and eight females aged from 44 to 71 years with a mean age of 54 years old, were studied prior to surgical interventions. Histological diagnosis was as follows: seven cases of meningothelial type, two cases of angiomatous type and one fibrous type. For quantitative analysis, regions of interest (ROI) on PET images were delineated on the tumor and the contralateral gray matter in comparison with eight cases with malignant gliomas (five cases of malignant astrocytoma and three cases of glioblastoma, aged from 14 to 70 years with a mean age of 41 years old). Hemocirculation of the tumor was exceedingly higher than that of the contralateral gray matter, which corresponded to neuroradiological findings of abundant tumor vessels. Low rOEF implicated an excessive blood flow beyond oxygen demand of the tumor. The raised metabolic rate (rCMRO2/rCMRGl) suggested rather aerobic glycolysis as compared with malignant gliomas. The kinetic rate constants of tracer transport from blood to brain (k1), reverse transport from brain to blood (k2), and phosphorylation (k3) were analyzed according to the three compartment model of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). Tumor k1 and k2 values markedly increased in all examined cases, suggesting high permeability due to lack of blood-brain barrier and an abundant blood supply.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7605682/
Assessment of [11C]-L-methionine transport into the human brain,"L A O'Tuama, T R Guilarte, K H Douglass, H N Wagner Jr, D F Wong, R F Dannals, H T Ravert, A A Wilson, N D LaFrance, A N Bice","Neutral amino acid transport into human brain was measured using a dual-probe positron detection system or positron emission tomography (PET). Rate constants (ml/min/cc) for brain accumulation of [11C]L-methionine measured with the dual detector ranged from 0.012 to 0.078 (average 0.031) under baseline conditions and from 0.010 to 0.017 (average 0.014) after administration of nonradioactive L-phenylalanine (100 mg/kg). The net rate of brain accumulation of L-methionine ranged from 0.42 to 2.89 (average 1.28) nmol/min/cc, and decreased by 27.5-91.2% (average 53.9%) after L-phenylalanine. PET-estimated accumulation rates (ml/min/cc) of [11C]L-methionine ranged from 0.004 to 0.028 (average 0.016) baseline and from 0.010 to 0.021 (average 0.017) after L-phenylalanine. Initial volumes of distribution (ml/cc) of [11C]L-methionine (dual detector) were 0.044-0.070 (average 0.058) baseline and 0.032-0.074 (average 0.051) after phenylalanine and (PET) 0.026-0.098 (average 0.051) baseline and 0.021-0.061 (average 0.042) after phenylalanine. PET permits more accurate measurement of tracer accumulation by brain, excluding noncerebral regions included in dual-detector measurements. The dual-detector system permits better temporal resolution, facilitating kinetic analysis, and requires only one-fortieth the dose of tracer needed for PET. Multiple studies in the same patient are thus possible at low cost.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3259240/
A comparative PET imaging study with the reversible and irreversible EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors [(11)C]erlotinib and [(18)F]afatinib in lung cancer-bearing mice,"Paul Slobbe, Albert D Windhorst, Marijke Stigter-van Walsum, Egbert F Smit, Heiko G Niessen, Flavio Solca, Gerd Stehle, Guus A M S van Dongen, Alex J Poot","Background: Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have experienced a tremendous boost in the last decade, where more than 15 small molecule TKIs have been approved by the FDA. Unfortunately, despite their promising clinical successes, a large portion of patients remain unresponsive to these targeted drugs. For non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the effectiveness of TKIs is dependent on the mutational status of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). The exon 19 deletion as well as the L858R point mutation lead to excellent sensitivity to TKIs such as erlotinib and gefitinib; however, despite initial good response, most patients invariably develop resistance against these first-generation reversible TKIs, e.g., via T790M point mutation. Second-generation TKIs that irreversibly bind to EGFR wild-type and mutant isoforms have therefore been developed and one of these candidates, afatinib, has now reached the market. Whether irreversible TKIs differ from reversible TKIs in their in vivo tumor-targeting properties is, however, not known and is the subject of the present study.

Methods: Erlotinib was labeled with carbon-11 and afatinib with fluorine-18 without modifying the structure of these compounds. A preclinical positron emission tomography (PET) study was performed in mice bearing NSCLC xenografts with a representative panel of mutations: an EGFR-WT xenograft cell line (A549), an acquired treatment-resistant L858R/T790M mutant (H1975), and a treatment-sensitive exon 19 deleted mutant (HCC827). PET imaging was performed in these xenografts with both tracers. Additionally, the effect of drug efflux transporter permeability glycoprotein (P-gp) on the tumor uptake of tracers was explored by therapeutic blocking with tariquidar.

Results: Both tracers only demonstrated selective tumor uptake in the HCC827 xenograft line (tumor-to-background ratio, [(11)C]erlotinib 1.9 ± 0.5 and [(18)F]afatinib 2.3 ± 0.4), thereby showing the ability to distinguish sensitizing mutations in vivo. No major differences were observed in the kinetics of the reversible and the irreversible tracers in each of the xenograft models. Under P-gp blocking conditions, no significant changes in tumor-to-background ratio were observed; however, [(18)F]afatinib demonstrated better tumor retention in all xenograft models.

Conclusions: TKI-PET provides a method to image sensitizing mutations and can be a valuable tool to compare the distinguished targeting properties of TKIs in vivo.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25853020/
Binding characteristics of [18F]PI-2620 distinguish the clinically predicted tau isoform in different tauopathies by PET,"Mengmeng Song, Leonie Beyer, Lena Kaiser, Henryk Barthel, Thilo van Eimeren, Ken Marek, Alexander Nitschmann, Maximilian Scheifele, Carla Palleis, Gesine Respondek, Maike Kern, Gloria Biechele, Jochen Hammes, Gèrard Bischof, Michael Barbe, Özgür Onur, Frank Jessen, Dorothee Saur, Matthias L Schroeter, Jost-Julian Rumpf, Michael Rullmann, Andreas Schildan, Marianne Patt, Bernd Neumaier, Olivier Barret, Jennifer Madonia, David S Russell, Andrew W Stephens, Andre Mueller, Sigrun Roeber, Jochen Herms, Kai Bötzel, Adrian Danek, Johannes Levin, Joseph Classen, Günter U Höglinger, Peter Bartenstein, Victor Villemagne, Alexander Drzezga, John Seibyl, Osama Sabri, Guido Boening, Sibylle Ziegler, Matthias Brendel","The novel tau-PET tracer [18F]PI-2620 detects the 3/4-repeat-(R)-tauopathy Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the 4R-tauopathies corticobasal syndrome (CBS) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). We determined whether [18F]PI-2620 binding characteristics deriving from non-invasive reference tissue modelling differentiate 3/4R- and 4R-tauopathies. Ten patients with a 3/4R tauopathy (AD continuum) and 29 patients with a 4R tauopathy (CBS, PSP) were evaluated. [18F]PI-2620 PET scans were acquired 0-60 min p.i. and the distribution volume ratio (DVR) was calculated. [18F]PI-2620-positive clusters (DVR ≥ 2.5 SD vs. 11 healthy controls) were evaluated by non-invasive kinetic modelling. R1 (delivery), k2 & k2a (efflux), DVR, 30-60 min standardized-uptake-value-ratios (SUVR30-60) and the linear slope of post-perfusion phase SUVR (9-60 min p.i.) were compared between 3/4R- and 4R-tauopathies.

Choice of anesthesia and data analysis method strongly increases sensitivity of 18F-FDG PET imaging during experimental epileptogenesis,"Ina Jahreis, Pablo Bascuñana, Tobias L Ross, Jens P Bankstahl, Marion Bankstahl","Purpose: Alterations in brain glucose metabolism detected by 2-deoxy-2-[18F]-fluoro-D-glucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) may serve as an early predictive biomarker and treatment target for epileptogenesis. Here, we aimed to investigate changes in cerebral glucose metabolism before induction of epileptogenesis, during epileptogenesis as well as during chronic epilepsy. As anesthesia is usually unavoidable for preclinical PET imaging and influences the distribution of the radiotracer, four different protocols were compared.

Procedures: We investigated 18F-FDG uptake phase in conscious rats followed by a static scan as well as dynamic scans under continuous isoflurane, medetomidine-midazolam-fentanyl (MMF), or propofol anesthesia. Furthermore, we applied different analysis approaches: atlas-based regional analysis, statistical parametric mapping, and kinetic analysis.

Results: At baseline and compared to uptake in conscious rats, isoflurane and propofol anesthesia resulted in decreased cortical 18F-FDG uptake while MMF anesthesia led to a globally decreased tracer uptake. During epileptogenesis, MMF anesthesia was clearly best distinctive for visualization of prominently increased glucometabolism in epilepsy-related brain areas. Kinetic modeling further increased sensitivity, particularly for continuous isoflurane anesthesia. During chronic epilepsy, hypometabolism affecting more or less the whole brain was detectable with all protocols.

Conclusion: This study reveals evaluation of anesthesia protocols for preclinical 18F-FDG PET imaging as a critical step in the study design. Together with an appropriate data analysis workflow, the chosen anesthesia protocol may uncover otherwise concealed disease-associated regional glucometabolic changes.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34818362/
Time profile of cerebral [18F]6-fluoro-L-DOPA metabolites in nonhuman primate: implications for the kinetics of therapeutic L-DOPA,"Christopher J Endres, Onofre T DeJesus, Hideo Uno, Doris J Doudet, Jerome R Nickles, James E Holden","At least two rates of dopamine turnover have been demonstrated in vivo, including a slow turnover rate that is associated with synaptic vesicles, and a faster rate that leads to rapid production of dopamine metabolites. Similarly, [18F]6-fluorodopamine (FDA), the decarboxylation product of the PET tracer [18F]6-fluoro-L-DOPA (FDOPA), may have multiple turnover rates which could substantially affect the interpretation of FDOPA uptake. To better characterize FDA turnover in vivo, we measured the formation of FDOPA metabolites in primate brain following bolus FDOPA injection with carbidopa pretreatment. FDOPA was allowed to circulate for either 30 minutes or 90 minutes, prior to removal of brain samples. The primary metabolites in striatum were [18F]6-fluoro-3-methyl-L-DOPA (3-OMFD), FDA, [18F]6-fluoro- L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (FDOPAC), and [18F]6-fluorohomovanillic acid (FHVA). The percentages of total radioactivity in striatum at 30 minutes and 90 minutes were: FDOPA(5%, 2%), FDA (39%, 23%), FDOPAC (12%, 3%), FHVA (14%, 34%), and 3-OMFD (29%, 39%). In cortex and cerebellum most of the activity (73%, 80%) was 3-OMFD. These data were compared against the metabolite profiles predicted by two compartmental models of FDOPA metabolism. A model that assumes only a single slow rate of FDA turnover predicted much lower concentrations of FDA metabolites (FDOPAC, FHVA) in striatum than were found in the brain assay, while a model that includes both slow and fast FDA turnover was in much better agreement. These findings extend and confirm previous observations of FDOPA metabolites. The implications for the interpretation of FDOPA PET, particularly in terms of the availability of dopamine synthesized from therapeutic L-DOPA, are discussed.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14766386/
Quantification of human brain benzodiazepine receptors using [18F]fluoroethylflumazenil: a first report in volunteers and epileptic patients,"Philippe Levêque, Sandra Sanabria-Bohorquez, Anne Bol, Anne De Volder, Daniel Labar, K Van Rijckevorsel, Bernard Gallez","Fluorine-18 fluoroethylflumazenil ([18F]FEF) is a tracer for central benzodiazepine (BZ) receptors which is proposed as an alternative to carbon-11 flumazenil for in vivo imaging using positron emission tomography (PET) in humans. In this study, [18F]FEF kinetic data were acquired using a 60-min two-injection protocol on three normal subjects and two patients suffering from mesiotemporal epilepsy as demonstrated by abnormal magnetic resonance imaging and [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography. First, a tracer bolus injection was performed and [18F]FEF rapidly distributed in the brain according to the known BZ receptor distribution. Thirty minutes later a displacement injection of 0.01 mg/kg of unlabelled flumazenil was performed. Activity was rapidly displaced from all BZ receptor regions demonstrating the specific binding of [18F]FEF. No displacement was observed in the pons. Plasma input function was obtained from arterial blood sampling, and metabolite analysis was performed by high-performance liquid chromatography. Metabolite quantification revealed a fast decrease in tracer plasma concentration, such that at 5 min post injection about 70% of the total radioactivity in plasma corresponded to [18F]FEF, reaching 24% at 30 min post injection. The interactions between [18F]FEF and BZ receptors were described using linear compartmental models with plasma input and reference tissue approaches. Binding potential values were in agreement with the known distribution of BZ receptors in human brain. Finally, in two patients with mesiotemporal sclerosis, reduced uptake of [18F]FEF was clearly observed in the implicated left hippocampus.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/13680197/
"P-glycoprotein Function in the Rodent Brain Displays a Daily Rhythm, a Quantitative In Vivo PET Study","Heli Savolainen, Peter Meerlo, Philip H Elsinga, Albert D Windhorst, Rudi A J O Dierckx, Nicola A Colabufo, Aren van Waarde, Gert Luurtsema","The blood-brain barrier (BBB) contributes to brain homeostasis by protecting the brain from harmful compounds. P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is one of the major efflux transporters at the BBB. In the present study, we assessed whether (1) P-gp function in the brain is constant or fluctuates across the day and (2) if it is affected by sleep deprivation. Four groups of rats were PET scanned with a radiolabeled P-gp substrate [18F]MC225, each at a different moment of the 12-h light-dark cycle to study diurnal variations: early sleep phase (ZT3), late sleep phase (ZT9), early active phase (ZT15), and late active phase (ZT21). In two additional groups, controls were allowed to sleep normally while experimental animals were sleep-deprived for 10 h in a slowly rotating drum during the sleep phase. Kinetic modeling with a one-tissue compartment model fit resulted for all brain regions in 1.2-1.8-fold higher distribution volumes (VT) at ZT15 than at other time points. VT-values at ZT3, ZT9, and ZT21 were not significantly different from each other. Regional tracer distribution volumes in controls and sleep-deprived animals were also not significantly different. Our results indicate that P-gp function in rats displays a daily rhythm with reduced function at the beginning of the active phase. This rhythm is not dependent on sleep since acute sleep deprivation had no effect. Knowing the diurnal variation of P-gp function could be important for the design of PET studies and for choosing the correct administration time for P-gp-dependent drugs.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27600138/
Biodistribution and pharmacokinetics of the alphavbeta3-selective tracer 18F-galacto-RGD in cancer patients,"Ambros J Beer, Roland Haubner, Michael Goebel, Stephan Luderschmidt, Mary E Spilker, Hans-Jürgen Wester, Wolfgang A Weber, Markus Schwaiger","(18)F-Galacto-RGD has been developed for PET of alpha(v)beta(3) integrin expression, a receptor involved in, for example, angiogenesis and metastasis. Our aim was to study the kinetics and biodistribution of (18)F-Galacto-RGD in cancer patients.

Methods: Nineteen patients with metastases of malignant melanoma (n = 7), sarcomas (n = 10), or osseous metastases (n = 2) were examined. After injection of 133-200 MBq (18)F-Galacto-RGD, 3 consecutive emission scans from the pelvis to the thorax or dynamic emission scans of the tumor over 60 min, followed by 1 static emission scan of the body, were acquired. Time-activity curves and standardized uptake values (SUVs) were derived by image region-of-interest analysis with image-based arterial input functions. Compartmental modeling was used to derive the distribution volume for muscle tissue and tumors.

Results: (18)F-Galacto-RGD showed rapid blood clearance and primarily renal excretion. SUVs in tumors ranged from 1.2 to 9.0. Tumor-to-blood and tumor-to-muscle ratios increased over time, with peak ratios of 3.1 +/- 2.0 and 7.7 +/- 4.3, respectively, at 72 min. The tumor kinetics were consistent with a 2-tissue compartment model with reversible specific binding. Distribution volume values were, on average, 4 times higher for tumor tissue (1.5 +/- 0.8) than those for muscle tissue (0.4 +/- 0.1). The data suggest that there was only minimal free and bound (specific or nonspecific) tracer in muscle tissue.

Conclusion: (18)F-Galacto-RGD demonstrates a highly favorable biodistribution in humans with specific receptor binding. Most important, this study shows that (18)F-Galacto-RGD allows visualization of alpha(v)beta(3) expression in tumors with high contrast. Consequently, this tracer offers a new strategy for noninvasive monitoring of molecular processes and may supply helpful information for planning and controlling of therapeutic approaches targeting the alpha(v)beta(3) integrin.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16085591/
Comparison of [11C]TZ1964B and [18F]MNI659 for PET imaging brain PDE10A in nonhuman primates,"Hui Liu, Hongjun Jin, Xuyi Yue, Junbin Han, Hao Yang, Hubert Flores, Yi Su, David Alagille, Joel S Perlmutter, Gilles Tamagnan, Zhude Tu","Phosphodiesterase 10A (PDE10A) inhibitors show therapeutic effects for diseases with striatal pathology.

The aim of this study was to compare two potent and selective PDE10A radiotracers, [11C]TZ1964B and [18F]MNI659 in the nonhuman primate (NHP) brain. Double scans in the same cynomolgus monkey on the same day were performed after injection of [11C]TZ1964B and [18F]MNI659. Specific uptake was determined in two ways: nondisplaceable binding potential (BPND) was calculated using cerebellum as the reference region and the PDE-10A enriched striatum as the target region of interest (ROI); the area under the time-activity curve (AUC) for the striatum to cerebellum ratio was also calculated. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of solvent-extracted NHP plasma identified the percentage of intact tracer versus radiolabeled metabolites samples post injection of each radiotracer. Both radiotracers showed high specific accumulation in NHP striatum. [11C]TZ1964B has higher striatal retention and lower specific striatal uptake than [18F]MNI659. The BPNDestimates of [11C]TZ1964B were 3.72 by Logan Reference model (LoganREF) and 4.39 by simplified reference tissue model (SRTM); the BPNDestimates for [18F]MNI659 were 5.08 (LoganREF) and 5.33 (SRTM). AUC ratios were 5.87 for [11C]TZ1964B and 7.60 for [18F]MNI659. Based on BPNDvalues in NHP striatum, coefficients of variation were ~10% for [11C]TZ1964B and ~30% for [18F]MNI659. Moreover, the metabolism study showed the percentage of parent compounds were ~70% for [11C]TZ1964B and ~50% for [18F]MNI659 60 min post injection.

Methods: [11C]PIB studies with arterial sampling were performed in eight AD patients and eight healthy controls. Retest scans were performed in six controls and six AD patients. Data were analysed using plasma input and reference tissue models, together with simple ratios.

Results: Test-retest variability was best ( approximately 3%) for SRTM2, a parametric method based on the simplified reference tissue model. Highest values ( approximately 10%) were found for plasma input models. Cerebellar V(T) values did not differ significantly between AD and controls.

[18F]FEOBV positron emission tomography may not be a suitable method to measure parasympathetic denervation in patients with Parkinson's disease,"Jacob Horsager, Niels Okkels, Tatyana D Fedorova, Karoline Knudsen, Casper Skjærbæk, Nathalie Van Den Berge, Jan Jacobsen, Ole Lajord Munk, Erik Hvid Danielsen, Dirk Bender, David J Brooks, Per Borghammer","Introduction: The peripheral autonomic nervous system may be involved years before onset of motor symptoms in some patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Specific imaging techniques to quantify the cholinergic nervous system in peripheral organs are an unmet need. We tested the hypothesis that patients with PD display decreased [18F]FEOBV uptake in peripheral organs - a sign of parasympathetic denervation.

Methods: We included 15 PD patients and 15 age- and sex matched healthy controls for a 70 min whole-body dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) acquisition. Compartmental modelling was used for tracer kinetic analyses of adrenal gland, pancreas, myocardium, spleen, renal cortex, muscle and colon. Standard uptake values (SUV) at 60-70 min post injection were also extracted for these organs. Additionally, SUVs were also determined in the total colon, prostate, parotid and submandibular glands.

Results: We found no statistically significant difference of [18F]FEOBV binding parameters in any organs between patients with PD and healthy controls, although trends were observed. The pancreas SUV showed a 14% reduction in patients (P = 0.021, not statistically significant after multiple comparison correction). We observed a trend towards lower SUVs in the pancreas, colon, adrenal gland, and myocardium of PD patients with versus without probable REM sleep behavior disorder.

Quantification of myocardial blood flow with 82Rb dynamic PET imaging,"Mireille Lortie, Rob S B Beanlands, Keiichiro Yoshinaga, Ran Klein, Jean N Dasilva, Robert A DeKemp","Purpose: The PET tracer (82)Rb is commonly used to evaluate regional perfusion defects for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease. There is limited information on the quantification of myocardial blood flow and flow reserve with this tracer. The goal of this study was to investigate the use of a one-compartment model of (82)Rb kinetics for the quantification of myocardial blood flow.

Methods: Fourteen healthy volunteers underwent rest and dipyridamole stress imaging with both (13)N-ammonia and (82)Rb within a 2-week interval. Myocardial blood flow was estimated from the time-activity curves measured with (13)N-ammonia using a standard two-compartment model. The uptake parameter of the one-compartment model was estimated from the time-activity curves measured with (82)Rb. To describe the relationship between myocardial blood flow and the uptake parameter, a nonlinear extraction function was fitted to the data. This function was then used to convert estimates of the uptake parameter to flow estimates. The extraction function was validated with an independent data set obtained from 13 subjects with documented evidence of coronary artery disease (CAD).

Results: The one-compartment model described (82)Rb kinetics very well (median R-square = 0.98). The flow estimates obtained with (82)Rb were well correlated with those obtained with (13)N-ammonia (r = 0.85), and the best-fit line did not differ significantly from the identity line. Data obtained from the subjects with CAD confirmed the validity of the estimated extraction function.

Conclusion: It is possible to obtain accurate estimates of myocardial blood flow and flow reserve with a one-compartment model of (82)Rb kinetics and a nonlinear extraction function.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17619189/

[Comparative analysis of quantifying methods in FDG-PET scans of the brain],"Z Krasznai, L Balkay, L Trón","The comparative analysis of three tracer kinetic methods most frequently applied for the quantization of the results of FDG-PET-brain scans was performed. The data of measurements on five healthy patients were evaluated by the most general method developed by Phelps, the Patlak-procedure and the SUV- (standard uptake value) method. It was demonstrated by the aid of correlation analysis that the applicability of the results of the more simple methods to estimate glucose metabolic rate (GMR) as calculated by the Phelps-method depended on the kind of the selected region of the brain. It was shown that the most considerable distortion occurred in the case of the same anatomical regions of the brain with both simplified methods. These regions were located either in the white matter or in the vicinity of larger size blood vessels or they were elements of the base of the skull [gyrus rectus (l. u.), pons, capsula interna (l. u.), cerebellum (l. u.), corpus callosum]. The distorted estimation is explained by the fact that the simpler models neglect dephosphorylation of the FDG-6P, and they also disregard the contribution of the intravascular activity to the tissue radioactivity as determined by the relatively low resolution PET measurement. The correlation coefficient between the GMR as calculated by the Phelps-method and glucose consumption data by the investigated simpler methods had very low values for regions located in the white matter, eventual close to blood vessels or being elements of the base of the skull.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11031832/
"Biodistribution and dosimetry in human healthy volunteers of the PET radioligands [11C]CHDI-00485180-R and [11C]CHDI-00485626, designed for quantification of cerebral aggregated mutant huntingtin","Aline Delva, Michel Koole, Kim Serdons, Guy Bormans, Longbin Liu, Jonathan Bard, Vinod Khetarpal, Celia Dominguez, Ignacio Munoz-Sanjuan, Andrew Wood, Mette Skinbjerg, Yuchuan Wang, Wim Vandenberghe, Koen Van Laere","Purpose: Huntington's disease is caused by a trinucleotide expansion in the HTT gene, which leads to aggregation of mutant huntingtin (mHTT) protein in the brain and neurotoxicity. Direct in vivo measurement of mHTT aggregates in human brain parenchyma is not yet possible. In this first-in-human study, we investigated biodistribution and dosimetry in healthy volunteers of [11C]CHDI-00485180-R ([11C]CHDI-180R) and [11C]CHDI-00485626 ([11C]CHDI-626), two tracers designed for PET imaging of aggregated mHTT in the brain that have been validated in preclinical models.

Methods: Biodistribution and radiation dosimetry studies were performed in 3 healthy volunteers (age 25.7 ± 0.5 years; 2 F) for [11C]CHDI-180R and in 3 healthy volunteers (age 35.3 ± 6.8 years; 2 F) for [11C]CHDI-626 using sequential whole-body PET-CT. Source organs were delineated in 3D using combined PET and CT data. Individual organ doses and effective doses were determined using OLINDA 2.1.

Results: There were no clinically relevant adverse events. The mean effective dose (ED) for [11C]CHDI-180R was 4.58 ± 0.65 μSv/MBq, with highest absorbed doses for liver (16.9 μGy/MBq), heart wall (15.9 μGy/MBq) and small intestine (15.8 μGy/MBq). Mean ED for [11C]CHDI-626 was 5.09 ± 0.06 μSv/MBq with the highest absorbed doses for the gallbladder (26.5 μGy/MBq), small intestine (20.4 μGy/MBq) and liver (19.6 μGy/MBq). Decay-corrected brain uptake curves showed promising kinetics for [11C]CHDI-180R, but for [11C]CHDI-626 an increasing signal over time was found, probably due to accumulation of a brain-penetrant metabolite.

Conclusion: [11C]CHDI-180R and [11C]CHDI-626 are safe for in vivo PET imaging in humans. The estimated radiation burden is in line with most11C-ligands. While [11C]CHDI-180R has promising kinetic properties in the brain, [11C]CHDI-626 is not suitable for human in vivo mHTT PET due to the possibility of a radiometabolite accumulating in brain parenchyma.

Combining MRI with PET for partial volume correction improves image-derived input functions in mice,"Eleanor Evans, Guido Buonincontri, David Izquierdo, Carmen Methner, Rob C Hawkes, Richard E Ansorge, Thomas Krieg, T Adrian Carpenter, Stephen J Sawiak","Accurate kinetic modelling using dynamic PET requires knowledge of the tracer concentration in plasma, known as the arterial input function (AIF). AIFs are usually determined by invasive blood sampling, but this is prohibitive in murine studies due to low total blood volumes. As a result of the low spatial resolution of PET, image-derived input functions (IDIFs) must be extracted from left ventricular blood pool (LVBP) ROIs of the mouse heart. This is challenging because of partial volume and spillover effects between the LVBP and myocardium, contaminating IDIFs with tissue signal. We have applied the geometric transfer matrix (GTM) method of partial volume correction (PVC) to 12 mice injected with18F-FDG affected by a Myocardial Infarction (MI), of which 6 were treated with a drug which reduced infarction size [1]. We utilised high resolution MRI to assist in segmenting mouse hearts into 5 classes: LVBP, infarcted myocardium, healthy myocardium, lungs/body and background. The signal contribution from these 5 classes was convolved with the point spread function (PSF) of the Cambridge split magnet PET scanner and a non-linear fit was performed on the 5 measured signal components. The corrected IDIF was taken as the fitted LVBP component. It was found that the GTM PVC method could recover an IDIF with less contamination from spillover than an IDIF extracted from PET data alone. More realistic values of Kiwere achieved using GTM IDIFs, which were shown to be significantly different (p<0.05) between the treated and untreated groups.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26213413/
Correlation of dynamic PET and gene array data in patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors,"Ludwig G Strauss, Antonia Dimitrakopoulou-Strauss, Dirk Koczan, Leyun Pan, Peter Hohenberger","Introduction: The results obtained with dynamic PET (dPET) were compared to gene expression data obtained in patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST). The primary aim was to assess the association of the dPET results and gene expression data.

Material and methods: dPET was performed following the injection of F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) in 22 patients with GIST. All patients were examined prior to surgery for staging purpose. Compartment and noncompartment models were used for the quantitative evaluation of the dPET examinations. Gene array data were based on tumor specimen obtained by surgery after the PET examinations.

Results: The data analysis revealed significant correlations for the dPET parameters and the expression of zinc finger genes (znf43, znf85, znf91, znf189). Furthermore, the transport of FDG (k1) was associated with VEGF-A. The cell cycle gene cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1C was correlated with the maximum tracer uptake (SUVmax) in the tumors.

Conclusions: The data demonstrate a dependency of the tracer kinetics on genes associated with prognosis in GIST. Furthermore, angiogenesis and cell proliferation have an impact on the tracer uptake.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22701369/
The Aged Striatum: Evidence of Molecular and Structural Changes Using a Longitudinal Multimodal Approach in Mice,"Bruno Lima Giacobbo, Özgün Özalay, Tomas Mediavilla, Madelene Ericsson, Jan Axelsson, Anna Rieckmann, Fahad Sultan, Daniel Marcellino","To study the aging human brain requires significant resources and time. Thus, mice models of aging can provide insight into changes in brain biological functions at a fraction of the time when compared to humans. This study aims to explore changes in dopamine D1and D2receptor availability and of gray matter density in striatum during aging in mice and to evaluate whether longitudinal imaging in mice may serve as a model for normal brain aging to complement cross-sectional research in humans. Mice underwent repeated structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI), and [11C]Raclopride and [11C]SCH23390 positron emission tomography (PET) was performed on a subset of aging mice. PET and sMRI data were analyzed by binding potential (BPND), voxel- and tensor-based morphometry (VBM and TBM, respectively). Longitudinal PET revealed a significant reduction in striatal BPNDfor D2receptors over time, whereas no significant change was found for D1receptors. sMRI indicated a significant increase in modulated gray matter density (mGMD) over time in striatum, with limited clusters showing decreased mGMD. Mouse [11C]Raclopride data is compatible with previous reports in human cross-sectional studies, suggesting that a natural loss of dopaminergic D2receptors in striatum can be assessed in mice, reflecting estimates from humans. No changes in D1were found, which may be attributed to altered [11C]SCH23390 kinetics in anesthetized mice, suggesting that this tracer is not yet able to replicate human findings. sMRI revealed a significant increase in mGMD. Although contrary to expectations, this increase in modulated GM density may be attributed to an age-related increase in non-neuronal cells.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35140600/
Image derived input functions for dynamic High Resolution Research Tomograph PET brain studies,"Jurgen E M Mourik, Floris H P van Velden, Mark Lubberink, Reina W Kloet, Bart N M van Berckel, Adriaan A Lammertsma, Ronald Boellaard","The High Resolution Research Tomograph (HRRT) is a dedicated human brain positron emission tomography (PET) scanner. The aim of the present study was to validate the use of image derived input functions (IDIF) as an alternative for arterial sampling for HRRT human brain studies. To this end, IDIFs were extracted from 3D ordinary Poisson ordered subsets expectation maximization (OP-OSEM) and reconstruction based partial volume corrected (PVC) OP-OSEM images. IDIFs, either derived directly from regions of interest or further calibrated using manual samples taken during scans, were evaluated for dynamic [(11)C]flumazenil data (n=6). Results obtained with IDIFs were compared with those obtained using blood sampler input functions (BSIF). These comparisons included areas under the curve (AUC) for peak (0-3.3 min) and tail (3.3-55.0 min). In addition, slope, intercept and Pearson's correlation coefficient of tracer kinetic analysis results based on IDIF and BSIF were calculated for each subject. Good peak AUC ratios (0.83+/-0.21) between IDIF and BSIF were found for calibrated IDIFs extracted from OP-OSEM images. This combination of IDIFs and images also provided good slope values (1.07+/-0.11). Improved resolution, as obtained with PVC OP-OSEM, changed AUC ratios to 1.14+/-0.35 and, for tracer kinetic analysis, slopes changed to 0.95+/-0.13. For all reconstructions, non-calibrated IDIFs gave poorer results (>61+/-34% higher slopes) compared with calibrated IDIFs. The results of this study indicate that the use of IDIFs, extracted from OP-OSEM or PVC OP-OSEM images, is feasible for dynamic HRRT data, thereby obviating the need for online arterial sampling.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18707007/
Combined whole-body dynamic and static PET/CT with low-dose [18F]PSMA-1007 in prostate cancer patients,"Christos Sachpekidis, Leyun Pan, Martin Groezinger, Dimitrios Stefanos Strauss, Antonia Dimitrakopoulou-Strauss","Aim: In addition to significant improvements in sensitivity and image quality, the recent introduction of long axial field-of-view (LAFOV) PET/CT scanners has enabled dynamic whole-body imaging for the first time. We aim herein to determine an appropriate acquisition time range for static low-dose [18F]PSMA-1007 PET imaging and to investigate the whole-body pharmacokinetics of [18F]PSMA-1007 by dynamic PET with the LAFOV Biograph Vision Quadra PET/CT in a group of prostate cancer patients.

Methodology: In total, 38 prostate cancer patients were enrolled in the analysis for staging or re-staging purposes. Thirty-four patients underwent dynamic whole-body PET/CT (60 min) followed by static whole-body PET/CT and four patients underwent static whole-body PET/CT only. The activity applied was 2 MBq/kg [18F]PSMA-1007. The static PET images of 10-min duration (PET-10) were reconstructed and further split into 8-min (PET-8), 6-min (PET-6), 5-min (PET-5), 4-min (PET-4), and 2-min (PET-2) duration groups. Comparisons were made between the different reconstructed scan times in terms of lesion detection rate and image quality based on SUV calculations of tumor lesions and the spleen, which served as background. Analysis of the dynamic PET/CT data was based on a two-tissue compartment model using an image-derived input function obtained from the descending aorta.

Results: Analysis of lesion detection rate showed no significant differences when reducing PET acquisitions from 10 up to 5 min. In particular, a total of 169 lesions were counted with PET-10, and the corresponding lesion detection rates (95% CI for the 90% quantile of the differences in tumor lesions) for shorter acquisitions were 100% (169/169) for PET-8 (95% CI: 0-0), 98.8% (167/169) for PET-6 (95% CI: 0-1), 95.9% (162/169) for PET-5 (95% CI: 0-3), 91.7% (155/169) for PET-4 (95% CI: 1-2), and 85.2% (144/169) for PET-2 (95% CI: 1-6). With the exception of PET-2, the differences observed between PET-10 and the other shorter acquisition protocols would have no impact on any patient in terms of clinical management. Objective evaluation of PET/CT image quality showed no significant decrease in tumor-to-background ratio (TBR) with shorter acquisition times, despite a gradual decrease in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the spleen. Whole-body quantitative [18F]PSMA-1007 pharmacokinetic analysis acquired with full dynamic PET scanning was feasible in all patients. Two-tissue compartment modeling revealed significantly higher values for the parameter k3in tumor lesions and parotid gland compared to liver and spleen, reflecting a higher specific tracer binding to the PSMA molecule and internalization rate in these tissues, a finding also supported by the respective time-activity curves. Furthermore, correlation analysis demonstrated a significantly strong positive correlation (r = 0.72) between SUV and k3in tumor lesions.

Conclusions: In prostate cancer, low-dose (2 MBq/kg) [18F]PSMA-1007 LAFOV PET/CT can reduce static scan time by 50% without significantly compromising lesion detection rate and objective image quality. In addition, dynamic PET can elucidate molecular pathways related to the physiology of [18F]PSMA-1007 in both tumor lesions and normal organs at the whole-body level. These findings unfold many of the potentials of the new LAFOV PET/CT technology in the field of PSMA-based diagnosis and theranostics of prostate cancer.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38286936/
The Search for a Subtype-Selective PET Imaging Agent for the GABAA Receptor Complex: Evaluation of the Radiotracer [11C]ADO in Nonhuman Primates,"Shu-Fei Lin, Frederic Bois, Daniel Holden, Nabeel Nabulsi, Richard Pracitto, Hong Gao, Michael Kapinos, Jo-Ku Teng, Anupama Shirali, Jim Ropchan, Richard E Carson, Charles S Elmore, Neil Vasdev, Yiyun Huang","The myriad physiological functions of γ-amino butyric acid (GABA) are mediated by the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex comprising of the GABAA, GABAB, and GABACgroups. The various GABAAsubunits with region-specific distributions in the brain subserve different functional and physiological roles. For example, the sedative and anticonvulsive effects of classical benzodiazepines are attributed to the α1subunit, and the α2and α3subunits mediate the anxiolytic effect. To optimize pharmacotherapies with improved efficacy and devoid of undesirable side effects for the treatment of anxiety disorders, subtype-selective imaging radiotracers are required to assess target engagement at GABA sites and determine the dose-receptor occupancy relationships. The goal of this work was to characterize, in nonhuman primates, the in vivo binding profile of a novel positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer, [11C]ADO, which has been indicated to have functional selectivity for the GABAAα2/α3subunits. High specific activity [11C]ADO was administrated to 3 rhesus monkeys, and PET scans of 120-minute duration were performed on the Focus-220 scanner. In the blood, [11C]ADO metabolized at a fairly rapid rate, with ∼36% of the parent tracer remaining at 30 minutes postinjection. Uptake levels of [11C]ADO in the brain were high (peak standardized uptake value of ∼3.0) and consistent with GABAAdistribution, with highest activity levels in cortical areas, intermediate levels in cerebellum and thalamus, and lowest uptake in striatal regions and amygdala. Tissue kinetics was fast, with peak uptake in all brain regions within 20 minutes of tracer injection. The one-tissue compartment model provided good fits to regional time-activity curves and reliable measurement of kinetic parameters. The absolute test-retest variability of regional distribution volumes ( VT) was low, ranging from 4.5% to 8.7%. Pretreatment with flumazenil (a subtype nonselective ligand, 0.2 mg/kg, intravenous [IV], n = 1), Ro15-4513 (an α5-selective ligand, 0.03 mg/kg, IV, n = 2), and zolpidem (an α1-selective ligand, 1.7 mg/kg, IV, n = 1) led to blockade of [11C]ADO binding by 96.5%, 52.5%, and 76.5%, respectively, indicating the in vivo binding specificity of the radiotracer. Using the nondisplaceable volume of distribution ( VND) determined from the blocking studies, specific binding signals, as measured by values of regional binding potential ( BPND), ranged from 0.6 to 4.4, which are comparable to those of [11C]flumazenil. In conclusion, [11C]ADO was demonstrated to be a specific radiotracer for the GABAAreceptors with several favorable properties: high brain uptake, fast tissue kinetics, and high levels of specific binding in nonhuman primates. However, subtype selectivity in vivo is not obvious for the radiotracer, and thus, the search for subtype-selective GABAAradiotracers continues.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28929924/
"Increased in vivo amyloid-β42 production, exchange, and loss in presenilin mutation carriers","Rachel Potter, Bruce W Patterson, Donald L Elbert, Vitaliy Ovod, Tom Kasten, Wendy Sigurdson, Kwasi Mawuenyega, Tyler Blazey, Alison Goate, Robert Chott, Kevin E Yarasheski, David M Holtzman, John C Morris, Tammie L S Benzinger, Randall J Bateman","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is hypothesized to be caused by an overproduction or reduced clearance of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide. Autosomal dominant AD (ADAD) caused by mutations in the presenilin (PSEN) gene have been postulated to result from increased production of Aβ42 compared to Aβ40 in the central nervous system (CNS). This has been demonstrated in rodent models of ADAD but not in human mutation carriers. We used compartmental modeling of stable isotope labeling kinetic (SILK) studies in human carriers of PSEN mutations and related noncarriers to evaluate the pathophysiological effects of PSEN1 and PSEN2 mutations on the production and turnover of Aβ isoforms. We compared these findings by mutation status and amount of fibrillar amyloid deposition as measured by positron emission tomography (PET) using the amyloid tracer Pittsburgh compound B (PIB). CNS Aβ42 to Aβ40 production rates were 24% higher in mutation carriers compared to noncarriers, and this was independent of fibrillar amyloid deposits quantified by PET PIB imaging. The fractional turnover rate of soluble Aβ42 relative to Aβ40 was 65% faster in mutation carriers and correlated with amyloid deposition, consistent with increased deposition of Aβ42 into plaques, leading to reduced recovery of Aβ42 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Reversible exchange of Aβ42 peptides with preexisting unlabeled peptide was observed in the presence of plaques. These findings support the hypothesis that Aβ42 is overproduced in the CNS of humans with PSEN mutations that cause AD, and demonstrate that soluble Aβ42 turnover and exchange processes are altered in the presence of amyloid plaques, causing a reduction in Aβ42 concentrations in the CSF.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23761040/
Radio-imaging in small animals,"R Myers, S Hume, P Bloomfield, T Jones","As the resolution of radio-imaging systems improves, the prospect of in-vivo imaging of small animals becomes more attractive. Purpose-built positron emission tomography (PET) scanners capable of imaging individual tissues within the rat brain are now in routine experimental use and in-vivo tracer and saturation-kinetic studies are now possible. The study of small animals in this way does have intrinsic problems and constraints associated with it. For example, the animal must be completely immobilized, stable ligand within the radiolabelled preparation may be limiting and anatomical definition may be poor. In spite of this, consistent, semi-quantitative data can be produced and in-vivo radio-imaging can provide a genuine and unique complement to more conventional techniques. Animal numbers can be significantly reduced and the quality of data improved due to reduced inter-animal variation, and longitudinal studies, to monitor disease progression, are feasible. As the resolution of imaging systems improves still further, such studies could be extended to mouse, in addition to rat, models of disease.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10667611/
Preclinical evaluation of a brain penetrant PARP PET imaging probe in rat glioblastoma and nonhuman primates,"Baosheng Chen, Devi Prasan Ojha, Takuya Toyonaga, Jie Tong, Richard Pracitto, Monique A Thomas, Michael Liu, Michael Kapinos, Li Zhang, Ming-Qiang Zheng, Daniel Holden, Krista Fowles, Jim Ropchan, Nabeel Nabulsi, Henk De Feyter, Richard E Carson, Yiyun Huang, Zhengxin Cai","Purpose: Currently, there are multiple active clinical trials involving poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors in the treatment of glioblastoma. The noninvasive quantification of baseline PARP expression using positron emission tomography (PET) may provide prognostic information and lead to more precise treatment. Due to the lack of brain-penetrant PARP imaging agents, the reliable and accurate in vivo quantification of PARP in the brain remains elusive. Herein, we report the synthesis of a brain-penetrant PARP PET tracer, (R)-2-(2-methyl-1-(methyl-11C)pyrrolidin-2-yl)-1H-benzo[d]imidazole-4-carboxamide ([11C]PyBic), and its preclinical evaluations in a syngeneic RG2 rat glioblastoma model and healthy nonhuman primates.

Methods: We synthesized [11C]PyBic using veliparib as the labeling precursor, performed dynamic PET scans on RG2 tumor-bearing rats and calculated the distribution volume ratio (DVR) using simplified reference region method 2 (SRTM2) with the contralateral nontumor brain region as the reference region. We performed biodistribution studies, western blot, and immunostaining studies to validate the in vivo PET quantification results. We characterized the brain kinetics and binding specificity of [11C]PyBic in nonhuman primates on FOCUS220 scanner and calculated the volume of distribution (VT), nondisplaceable volume of distribution (VND), and nondisplaceable binding potential (BPND) in selected brain regions.

Results: [11C]PyBic was synthesized efficiently in one step, with greater than 97% radiochemical and chemical purity and molar activity of 148 ± 85 MBq/nmol (n = 6). [11C]PyBic demonstrated PARP-specific binding in RG2 tumors, with 74% of tracer binding in tumors blocked by preinjected veliparib (i.v., 5 mg/kg). The in vivo PET imaging results were corroborated by ex vivo biodistribution, PARP1 immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting data. Furthermore, brain penetration of [11C]PyBic was confirmed by quantitative monkey brain PET, which showed high specific uptake (BPND> 3) and low nonspecific uptake (VND< 3 mL/cm3) in the monkey brain.

Conclusion: [11C]PyBic is the first brain-penetrant PARP PET tracer validated in a rat glioblastoma model and healthy nonhuman primates. The brain kinetics of [11C]PyBic are suitable for noninvasive quantification of available PARP binding in the brain, which posits [11C]PyBic to have broad applications in oncology and neuroimaging.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36849748/
Partial-volume correction in dynamic PET-CT: effect on tumor kinetic parameter estimation and validation of simplified metrics,"M C F Cysouw, S V S Golla, V Frings, E F Smit, O S Hoekstra, G M Kramer, R Boellaard, QuIC-ConCePT Consortium","Background: Partial-volume effects generally result in an underestimation of tumor tracer uptake on PET-CT for small lesions, necessitating partial-volume correction (PVC) for accurate quantification. However, investigation of PVC in dynamic oncological PET studies to date is scarce. The aim of this study was to investigate PVC's impact on tumor kinetic parameter estimation from dynamic PET-CT acquisitions and subsequent validation of simplified semi-quantitative metrics. Ten patients with EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer underwent dynamic18F-fluorothymidine PET-CT before, 7 days after, and 28 days after commencing treatment with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Parametric PVC was applied using iterative deconvolution without and with highly constrained backprojection (HYPR) denoising, respectively. Using an image-derived input function with venous parent plasma calibration, we estimated full kinetic parameters VT, K1, and k3/k4(BPND) using a reversible two-tissue compartment model, and simplified metrics (SUV and tumor-to-blood ratio) at 50-60 min post-injection.

Results: PVC had a non-linear effect on measured activity concentrations per timeframe. PVC significantly changed each kinetic parameter, with a median increase in VTof 11.8% (up to 25.1%) and 10.8% (up to 21.7%) without and with HYPR, respectively. Relative changes in kinetic parameter estimates vs. simplified metrics after applying PVC were poorly correlated (correlations 0.36-0.62; p < 0.01). PVC increased correlations between simplified metrics and VTfrom 0.82 and 0.81 (p < 0.01) to 0.90 and 0.88 (p < 0.01) for SUV and TBR, respectively, albeit non-significantly. PVC also increased correlations between treatment-induced changes in simplified metrics vs. VTat 7 (SUV) and 28 (SUV and TBR) days after treatment start non-significantly. Delineation on partial-volume corrected PET images resulted in a median decrease in metabolic tumor volume of 14.3% (IQR - 22.1 to - 7.5%), and increased the effect of PVC on kinetic parameter estimates.

Conclusion: PVC has a significant impact on tumor kinetic parameter estimation from dynamic PET-CT data, which differs from its effect on simplified metrics. However, it affected validation of these simplified metrics both as single measurements and as biomarkers of treatment response only to a small extent. Future dynamic PET studies should preferably incorporate PVC.

Assessment of quantitative [18F]Sodium fluoride PET measures of knee subchondral bone perfusion and mineralization in osteoarthritic and healthy subjects,"L Watkins, J MacKay, B Haddock, V Mazzoli, S Uhlrich, G Gold, F Kogan","Objective: Molecular information derived from dynamic [18F]sodium fluoride ([18F]NaF) PET imaging holds promise as a quantitative marker of bone metabolism. The objective of this work was to evaluate physiological mechanisms of [18F]NaF uptake in subchondral bone of individuals with and without knee osteoarthritis (OA).

Methods: Eleven healthy volunteers and twenty OA subjects were included. Both knees of all subjects were scanned simultaneously using a 3T hybrid PET/MRI system. MRI MOAKS assessment was performed to score the presence and size of osteophytes, bone marrow lesions, and cartilage lesions. Subchondral bone kinetic parameters of bone perfusion (K1), tracer extraction fraction, and total tracer uptake into bone (Ki) were evaluated using the Hawkins 3-compartment model. Measures were compared between structurally normal-appearing bone regions and those with structural findings.

Results: Mean and maximum SUV and kinetic parameters Ki, K1, and extraction fraction were significantly different between Healthy subjects and subjects with OA. Between-group differences in metabolic parameters were observed both in regions where the OA group had degenerative changes as well as in regions that appeared structurally normal.

Conclusions: Results suggest that bone metabolism is altered in OA subjects, including bone regions with and without structural findings, compared to healthy subjects. Kinetic parameters of [18F]NaF uptake in subchondral bone show potential to quantitatively evaluate the role of bone physiology in OA initiation and progression. Objective measures of bone metabolism from [18F]NaF PET imaging can complement assessments of structural abnormalities observed on MRI.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33639259/
Initial Evaluation of Direct 4D Parametric Reconstruction with Human PET Data,"Jianhua Yan, Beata Planeta-Wilson, Jean-Dominique Gallezot, Richard E Carson","Previously, we presented a direct EM method for producing kinetic parameter images from list mode PET data, where the time-activity curve for each voxel is described by a one-tissue compartment model (1T). The initial evaluations were performed with simulations, without motion, randoms, or scatter effects included. By extension of our previous frame-based physics correction methods, a practical direct 4D parametric reconstruction algorithm is now proposed and implemented for human data. Initial evaluations were performed using 3 human subjects with the serotonin transporter tracer [(11)C]AFM. Comparisons with the 2-step approach (frame-based reconstruction followed by voxel-by-voxel parameter estimation) provided encouraging initial results. Regional analysis showed that the 2-step and 4D methods have similar K(1) and V(T) values, but with a consistent difference. Visual analysis showed some noise reduction in 4D. These initial results suggest that direct 4D parametric reconstruction can be performed with real data, and offers the potential for improved accuracy and precision over the 2-step frame method.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21278923/
Quantitative cerebral blood flow measurements in the rat using a beta-probe and H2 15O,"Bruno Weber, Nicolas Späth, Matthias Wyss, Damian Wild, Cyrill Burger, Ross Stanley, Alfred Buck","Beta-probes are a relatively new tool for tracer kinetic studies in animals. They are highly suited to evaluate new positron emission tomography tracers or measure physiologic parameters at rest and after some kind of stimulation or intervention. In many of these experiments, the knowledge of CBF is highly important. Thus, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the method of CBF measurements using a beta-probe and H2 15O. CBF was measured in the barrel cortex of eight rats at baseline and after acetazolamide challenge. Trigeminal nerve stimulation was additionally performed in five animals. In each category, three injections of 250 to 300 MBq H2 15O were performed at 10-minute intervals. Data were analyzed using a standard one-tissue compartment model (K1 = CBF, k2 = CBF/p, where p is the partition coefficient). Values for K1 were 0.35 +/- 0.09, 0.58 +/- 0.16, and 0.49 +/- 0.03 mL x min(-1) x mL(-1) at rest, after acetazolamide challenge, and during trigeminal nerve stimulation, respectively. The corresponding values for k2 were 0.55 +/- 0.12, 0.94 +/- 0.16, and 0.85 +/- 0.12 min(-7), and for p were 0.64 +/- 0.05, 0.61 +/- 0.07, and 0.59 +/- 0.06. The standard deviation of the difference between two successive experiments, a measure for the reproducibility of the method, was 10.1%, 13.0%, and 5.7% for K1, k2, and p, respectively. In summary, beta-probes in conjunction with H2 15O allow the reproducible quantitative measurement of CBF, although some systematic underestimation seems to occur, probably because of partial volume effects.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14663341/
[1-11C]-Butanol Positron Emission Tomography reveals an impaired brain to nasal turbinates pathway in aging amyloid positive subjects,"Neel H Mehta, Xiuyuan Wang, Samantha A Keil, Ke Xi, Liangdong Zhou, Kevin Lee, Wanbin Tan, Edward Spector, Amirhossein Goldan, James Kelly, Nicolas A Karakatsanis, P David Mozley, Sadek Nehmeh, J Levi Chazen, Simon Morin, John Babich, Jana Ivanidze, Silky Pahlajani, Emily B Tanzi, Leslie Saint-Louis, Tracy Butler, Kewei Chen, Henry Rusinek, Roxana O Carare, Yi Li, Gloria C Chiang, Mony J de Leon","Background: Reduced clearance of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has been suggested as a pathological feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). With extensive documentation in non-human mammals and contradictory human neuroimaging data it remains unknown whether the nasal mucosa is a CSF drainage site in humans. Here, we used dynamic PET with [1-11C]-Butanol, a highly permeable radiotracer with no appreciable brain binding, to test the hypothesis that tracer drainage from the nasal pathway reflects CSF drainage from brain. As a test of the hypothesis, we examined whether brain and nasal fluid drainage times were correlated and affected by brain amyloid.

Methods: 24 cognitively normal subjects (≥ 65 years) were dynamically PET imaged for 60 min. using [1-11C]-Butanol. Imaging with either [11C]-PiB or [18F]-FBB identified 8 amyloid PET positive (Aβ+) and 16 Aβ- subjects. MRI-determined regions of interest (ROI) included: the carotid artery, the lateral orbitofrontal (LOF) brain, the cribriform plate, and an All-turbinate region comprised of the superior, middle, and inferior turbinates. The bilateral temporalis muscle and jugular veins served as control regions. Regional time-activity were used to model tracer influx, egress, and AUC.

Results: LOF and All-turbinate 60 min AUC were positively associated, thus suggesting a connection between the brain and the nose. Further, the Aβ+ subgroup demonstrated impaired tracer kinetics, marked by reduced tracer influx and slower egress.

Conclusion: The data show that tracer kinetics for brain and nasal turbinates are related to each other and both reflect the amyloid status of the brain. As such, these data add to evidence that the nasal pathway is a potential CSF drainage site in humans. These data warrant further investigation of brain and nasal contributions to protein clearance in neurodegenerative disease.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38566110/
Quantitative Assessment of Arthritis Activity in Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients Using [11C]DPA-713 Positron Emission Tomography,"Maqsood Yaqub, Nicki J F Verweij, Simone Pieplenbosch, Ronald Boellaard, Adriaan A Lammertsma, Conny J van der Laken","Treatment for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) should be started as early as possible to prevent destruction of bone and cartilage in affected joints. A new diagnostic tool for both early diagnosis and therapy monitoring would be valuable to reduce permanent joint damage. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of macrophages is a previously demonstrated non-invasive means to visualize (sub)clinical arthritis in RA patients. We developed a kinetic model to quantify uptake of the macrophage tracer [11C]DPA-713 (N,N-diethyl-2-[2-(4-methoxyphenyl)-5,7-dimethylpyrazolo [1,5-a]pyrimidin-3-yl]acetamide) in arthritic joints of RA patients and to assess the performance of several simplified methods. Dynamic [11C]DPA-713 scans of 60 min with both arterial and venous blood sampling were performed in five patients with clinically active disease. [11C]DPA-713 showed enhanced uptake in affected joints of RA patients, with tracer uptake levels corresponding to clinical presence and severity of arthritis. The optimal quantitative model for assessment of [11C]DPA-713 uptake was the irreversible two tissue compartment model (2T3k). Both Kiand standardized uptake value (SUV) correlated with the presence of arthritis in RA patients.

The purposes of this study were, first, to analyze standard and delayed 18F-FDG PET images visually and quantitatively to determine whether definition of tumor improved at later imaging times and, second, to investigate the dynamics of model-derived kinetic rate constants, particularly k4.

Methods: Nineteen adult patients with supratentorial gliomas were imaged from 0 to 90 min and once or twice later at 180-480 min after injection. In 15 patients, arterial sampling provided the early input function. Venous sampling provided the remaining curve to the end of the imaging sequence. Standardized uptake value (SUV) was calculated as tissue concentration of tracer per injected tracer dose per body weight. Ratios of tumor SUV relative to the SUV of gray matter, brain (including gray and white matter), or white matter were calculated at each imaging time point. Dynamic image data from tumor, gray matter, brain, or white matter were analyzed using a 2-compartment, 4-parameter model applied for the entire duration of imaging, in which delay, K1, distribution volume, k3, and k4 were optimized using a nonlinear optimization method. Parameter estimation for each region included both an early subset of data from a conventional dynamic imaging period (0-60 min) and the full, extended dataset for each region.

Results: In 12 of the 19 patients, visual analysis showed that the delayed images better distinguished the high uptake in tumors relative to uptake in gray matter. SUV comparisons also showed greater uptake in the tumors than in gray matter, brain, or white matter at the delayed times. The estimated k4 values for tumors were not significantly different from those for gray matter in early imaging analysis but were lower (P < 0.01) using the extended-time data.

Conclusion: The kinetic parameter results confirm the visual and SUV interpretation that tumor enhancement is greater than enhancement of surrounding brain regions at later imaging times, consistent with a greater effect of FDG-6-phosphate degradation on normal brain relative to glioma.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15471829/
"Intravenous and oral whole body ketone dosimetry, biodistribution, metabolite correction and kinetics studied by (R)-[1-11C]β-hydroxybutyrate ([11C]OHB) PET in healthy humans","Thien Vinh Luong, Erik Nguyen Nielsen, Lise Falborg, Mette Louise Gram Kjærulff, Lars Poulsen Tolbod, Esben Søndergaard, Niels Møller, Ole Lajord Munk, Lars Christian Gormsen","Background: Ketones are increasingly recognized as an important and possibly oxygen sparing source of energy in vital organs such as the heart, the brain and the kidneys. Drug treatments, dietary regimens and oral ketone drinks designed to deliver ketones for organ and tissue energy production have therefore gained popularity. However, whether ingested ketones are taken up by various extra-cerebral tissues and to what extent is still largely unexplored. It was therefore the aim of this study to use positron emission tomography (PET) to explore the whole body dosimetry, biodistribution and kinetics of the ketone tracer (R)-[1-11C]β-hydroxybutyrate ([11C]OHB). Six healthy subjects (3 women and 3 men) underwent dynamic PET studies after both intravenous (90 min) and oral (120 min) administration of [11C]OHB. Dosimetry estimates of [11C]OHB was calculated using OLINDA/EXM software, biodistribution was assessed visually and [11C]OHB tissue kinetics were obtained using an arterial input function and tissue time-activity curves.

Results: Radiation dosimetry yielded effective doses of 3.28 [Formula: see text]Sv/MBq (intravenous administration) and 12.51 [Formula: see text]Sv/MBq (oral administration). Intravenous administration of [11C]OHB resulted in avid radiotracer uptake in the heart, liver, and kidneys, whereas lesser uptake was observed in the salivary glands, pancreas, skeletal muscle and red marrow. Only minimal uptake was noted in the brain. Oral ingestion of the tracer resulted in rapid radiotracer appearance in the blood and radiotracer uptake in the heart, liver and kidneys. In general, [11C]OHB tissue kinetics after intravenous administration were best described by a reversible 2-tissue compartmental model.

Conclusion: The PET radiotracer [11C]OHB shows promising potential in providing imaging data on ketone uptake in various physiologically relevant tissues. As a result, it may serve as a safe and non-invasive imaging tool for exploring ketone metabolism in organs and tissues of both patients and healthy individuals.

FBPA PET in boron neutron capture therapy for cancer: prediction of (10)B concentration in the tumor and normal tissue in a rat xenograft model,"Kohei Hanaoka, Tadashi Watabe, Sadahiro Naka, Yasukazu Kanai, Hayato Ikeda, Genki Horitsugi, Hiroki Kato, Kayako Isohashi, Eku Shimosegawa, Jun Hatazawa","Background: Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) is a molecular radiation treatment based on the (10)B (n, α) (7)Li nuclear reaction in cancer cells, in which delivery of (10)B by 4-borono-phenylalanine conjugated with fructose (BPA-fr) to the cancer cells is of critical importance. The PET tracer 4-borono-2-(18) F-fluoro-phenylalanine (FBPA) has been used to predict the accumulation of BPA-fr before BNCT. However, because of the difference in chemical structure between BPA-fr and FBPA and the difference in the dose administered between BPA-fr (therapeutic dose) and FBPA (tracer dose), the predictive value of FBPA PET for BPA-fr accumulation in the tumor and normal tissues is not yet clearly proven. We conducted this study to validate FBPA PET as a useful test to predict the accumulation of BPA-fr in the tumor and normal tissues before BNCT.

Methods: RGC-6 rat glioma cells (1.9 × 10(7)) were implanted subcutaneously in seven male F344 rats. On day 20 after the tumor implantation, dynamic PET scan was performed on four rats after injection of FBPA for 1 h. Whole-body PET/CT was performed 1 h after intravenous injection of the FBPA solution (30.5 ± 0.7 MBq, 1.69 ± 1.21 mg/kg). PET accumulation of FBPA in the tumor tissue and various normal tissues was estimated as a percentage of the injected dose per gram (%ID/g). One hour after the PET/CT scan, BPA-fructose (167.32 ± 18.65 mg/kg) was injected intravenously, and the rats were dissected 1 h after the BPA-fr injection. The absolute concentration of (10)B in the autopsied tissues and blood was measured by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES).

Results: The highest absolute concentration of (10)B determined by ICP-OES was found in the kidney (4.34 ± 0.84 %ID/g), followed by the pancreas (2.73 ± 0.63 %ID/g), and the tumor (1.44 ± 0.44 %ID/g). A significant positive correlation was found between the accumulation levels of BPA-fr and FBPA (r = 0.91, p < 0.05).

Conclusions: FBPA PET can reliably predict accumulation of BPA-fr in the tumor as well as normal tissues.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25621196/
Brain tumor iron uptake measured with positron emission tomography and 52Fe-citrate,"U Roelcke, K L Leenders, K von Ammon, E W Radü, P Vontobel, I Günther, M Psylla","Iron and transferrin are required for DNA synthesis and cell division. Cellular iron uptake is mediated by transferrin receptors. In order to investigate whether iron uptake in brain tumors is associated with their histological grade, we studied 24 patients (5 astrocytoma, 11 glioblastoma, 8 meningioma) using positron emission tomography and 52Fe-citrate. Tracer uptake from blood into brain and tumor tissue was assessed 1. using multiple time graphical analysis yielding a measure for unidirectional net tracer uptake (Ki) and 2.) testing a one- and two-tissue kinetic compartment model, where K1 denotes tracer uptake from blood into tissue, k2 efflux from tissue into plasma, and k3 specific tracer binding. In the plasma, 52Fe was bound to a 80 kD protein (transferrin). Ki (in units of 10(-5)/min) was higher in glioblastomas (Ki mean +/- SD 13.6 +/- 6.1) compared with astrocytomas (4.8 +/- 3.5, Mann Whitney p = 0.015) and contralateral brain (2.2 +/- 0.9, Mann Whitney p = 0.009). Highest values were found in meningiomas (no blood-brain barrier (BBB); Ki 33.4 +/- 16.5, Mann Whitney p = 0.008 compared with glioblastomas). Among the compartment models, fitting with K1 and regional plasma volume explained the data best (one-tissue model), data fits were not significantly improved by addition of a k2 or k3 parameter. K1 and Ki values were significantly correlated (Spearman Rank, p = 0.0006). We conclude that 52Fe accumulation in tumors is governed by tracer uptake at the BBB, and does not reflect number of transferrin receptors at the level of tumor cells.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8858521/
MicroPET and autoradiographic imaging of breast cancer alpha v-integrin expression using 18F- and 64Cu-labeled RGD peptide,"Xiaoyuan Chen, Ryan Park, Michel Tohme, Anthony H Shahinian, James R Bading, Peter S Conti","Cell adhesion molecules alphavbeta3 and alphavbeta5 play a pivotal role in tumor angiogenesis and metastasis. Antiangiogenic therapy by using small peptide antagonists of alphav-integrins slows tumor growth and prevents tumor spread. The ability to visualize and quantify integrin expression will enable selection of appropriate patients for clinical trials, following determination of treatment efficacy and development of new potent drugs. We have previously labeled cyclic RGD peptide c(RGDyK) with 125I and 18F and applied the radiotracers to both subcutaneous and orthotopic brain tumor models. Here we conjugated c(RGDyK) with 1,4,7,10-tetraaza-1,4,7,10-tetradodecane-N,N',N' ',N' ""-tetraacetic acid (DOTA) and labeled the DOTA-RGD conjugate with 64Cu (t1/2) = 12.8 h, 19% beta+) in high radiochemical purity and specific activity. The tumor targeting ability and in vivo kinetics of 64Cu-DOTA-RGD was compared with [18F]FB-RGD and 125I-RGD in orthotopic MDA-MB-435 breast cancer model. All three radiotracers revealed fast blood clearance and high tumor-to-blood and tumor-to-muscle ratios. 125I-RGD had higher tumor uptake than the corresponding 18F and 64Cu analogues. [18F]FB-RGD indicated a fast tumor washout rate and an unfavorable hepatobiliary excretion pathway, resulting in significant activity accumulation in gallbladder and intestines. 64Cu-DOTA-RGD had prolonged tumor retention (1.44 +/- 0.09 %ID/g at 4 h postinjection) and persistent uptake in the liver. All three tracers revealed receptor specific tumor accumulation which were illustrated by effective blocking via coinjection with a blocking dose of c(RGDyK). Static microPET imaging and whole-body autoradiography showed strong contrast from the contralateral background. In conclusion, overall molecular charge and characteristics of radiolabels have profound effects on tumor accumulation and in vivo kinetics of radiolabeled RGD peptide. Further modification of the RGD peptide and optimization of the tracer for prolonged tumor uptake and improved in vivo kinetics are being explored.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14733582/
6-[18F]fluoro-L-dopa probes dopamine turnover rates in central dopaminergic structures,"J R Barrio, S C Huang, W P Melega, D C Yu, J M Hoffman, J S Schneider, N Satyamurthy, J C Mazziotta, M E Phelps","6-[18F]Fluoro-L-DOPA (FDOPA) cerebral kinetics and metabolism were correlated in normal primates (Macaca nemestrina) and primates with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) induced unilateral Parkinsonism. Application of a tracer kinetic model to positron emission tomography (PET) data indicated that the model allows reliable estimation of FDOPA blood brain barrier transport, decarboxylation and release of stored 6-[18F]fluorodopamine (FDA) radioactivity in normal striatum (k4 = 0.005/min, turnover half-time greater than or equal to 2 hr), in agreement with biochemical data. PET scans of MPTP treated monkeys revealed 40-50% reduction in total striatal activity in comparison with pre-MPTP scans. Monkey brain biochemical analysis revealed that the reduction in activity was mainly due to a decrease in FDA and its metabolites, 6[18F]fluorohomovanillic (FHVA) and 6-[18F]fluoro-3, 4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (FDOPAC). The remaining activity in tissue was 3-0-methyl-6-[18F]fluoro-L-DOPA (3-OMFD) of peripheral origin. The (FHVA + FDOPAC)/FDA ratio was 1:2 in normal putamen and greater than or equal to 6:1 in the lesioned putamen, indicative of a dramatic increase in turnover of FDA. Both kinetic and biochemical data indicate that FDOPA labels a slow turnover rate pool of dopamine in rat and primate brain. This turnover rate for stored dopamine (DA) is accelerated with dopaminergic cell losses (e.g., MPTP-induced Parkinsonism).",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2127807/
Parametric imaging: a promising approach for the evaluation of dynamic PET-18F-FDG studies - the DKFZ experience,"Antonia Dimitrakopoulou-Strauss, Leyun Pan, Ludwig G Strauss","Dynamic positron emission studies (dPET) with fluorine-18-fluoro-deoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) were performed in oncologic patients. The primary aim was to evaluate the impact of parametric imaging and assess its feasibility with regard to diagnostics and treatment management. Parametric PET images based on different algorithms have been calculated. Regression-based images, influx images according to Patlak, two-tissue compartment images as well as non-compartmental approaches, based on the fractal dimension, principal component images, and similarity mapping have been used. Our results showed that the use of parametric images is helpful to visualize quantitative parameters of the tracer kinetics and adds a new dimension to the existing conventional PET or PET/computerized tomography (CT) images. Especially, non-compartment models are computationally fast and can be applied in daily routine to gain more detailed information about the distribution of a tracer over time and space. In conclusion, it is our opinion that parametric images will gain increasing importance and find their way into clinical routine due to the improvement of the technical equipment, like computer power, faster data acquisition by new generations of PET/CT scanners and more sophisticated software for data evaluation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20411165/
Feasibility of imaging pentose cycle glucose metabolism in gliomas with PET: studies in rat brain tumor models,"A M Spence, M M Graham, M Muzi, S D Freeman, J M Link, J R Grierson, F O'Sullivan, D Stein, G L Abbott, K A Krohn","The feasibility of imaging pentose cycle (PC) glucose utilization in human gliomas with PET was explored in two rat glioma models by means of glucose radiolabeled in either the carbon-1 (C-1) or carbon-6 (C-6) position.

Methods: In vitro, monolayers of T-36B-10 glioma, tissue slices of intracerebral glioma grafts or slices of normal brain were fed [1-14C]glucose or [6-14C]glucose, and the generated [14C]CO2 was trapped to quantitate the ratio of [14C]CO2 from 14C-1 versus 14C-6. In vivo, rats bearing grafts of either T-36B-10 or T-C6 rat gliomas at six subcutaneous sites received simultaneous intravenous injections of either [1-11C]glucose and [6-14C]glucose, or [1-14C]glucose and [6-11C]glucose. Tumors were excised between 5 and 55 min postinjection to quantify tracer uptake while arterial plasma was collected to derive time-activity input curves.

Results: In vitro, the C-1/C-6 ratio for CO2 production from T-36B-10 monolayers was 8.8 +/- 0.4 (s.d.), in glioma slices it was 6.1 +/- 2.1 and in normal brain slices it was 1.1 +/- 0.7. PC metabolism in T-36B-10 was 1.8% +/- 0.5 of total glucose utilization. In vivo, tumor radioactivity levels normalized by plasma isotopic glucose levels showed that retained C-1 relative to C-6 radiolabeled glucose was significantly lower in both gliomas, 4.9% lower in T-36B-10 (p < 0.01) and 4.7% lower in T-C6 (p < 0.01). In an additional group of rats bearing T-36B-10 gliomas and exposed to 10 Gy of 137Cs irradiation 4 hr before isotope injection, the C-1 level was 5.6% lower than that for C-6 (p < 0.05). These results were analyzed with a model of glucose metabolism that simultaneously optimized parameters for C-1 and C-6 glucose kinetics by simulating the C-1 and C-6 tumor time-activity curves. The rate constant for loss of radiolabeled carbon from the tumors, k4, was higher for C-1 than for C-6 in all groups of rats (19% higher for T-36B-10 unirradiated, 32% for T-36B-10 irradiated and 32% for T-C6 unirradiated).

Conclusion: Mathematical modeling, Monte Carlo simulations and construction of receiver-operator-characteristic curves show that if human gliomas have a similar fractional use of the PC, it should be measurable with PET using sequential studies with [1-11C]glucose and [6-11C]glucose.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9098213/
PET evaluation of the dopamine system of the human brain,"N D Volkow, J S Fowler, S J Gatley, J Logan, G J Wang, Y S Ding, S Dewey","Dopamine plays a pivotal role in the regulation and control of movement, motivation and cognition. It also is closely linked to reward, reinforcement and addiction. Abnormalities in brain dopamine are associated with many neurological and psychiatric disorders including Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia and substance abuse. This close association between dopamine and neurological and psychiatric diseases and with substance abuse make it an important topic in research in the neurosciences and an important molecular target in drug development. PET enables the direct measurement of components of the dopamine system in the living human brain. It relies on radiotracers which label dopamine receptors, dopamine transporters, precursors of dopamine or compounds which have specificity for the enzymes which degrade dopamine. Additionally, by using tracers that provide information on regional brain metabolism or blood flow as well as neurochemically specific pharmacological interventions, PET can be used to assess the functional consequences of changes in brain dopamine activity. PET dopamine measurements have been used to investigate the normal human brain and its involvement in psychiatric and neurological diseases. It has also been used in psychopharmacological research to investigate dopamine drugs used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease and of schizophrenia as well as to investigate the effects of drugs of abuse on the dopamine system. Since various functional and neurological parameters can be studied in the same subject, PET enables investigation of the functional integrity of the dopamine system in the human brain and investigation of the interactions of dopamine with other neurotransmitters. Through the parallel development of new radiotracers, kinetic models and better instruments, PET technology is enabling investigation of increasingly more complex aspects of the human brain dopamine system. This paper summarizes the different tracers and experimental strategies developed to evaluate the various elements of the dopamine system in the human brain with PET and their applications to clinical research.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8965206/
Radiosynthesis and preclinical evaluation of a 68Ga-labeled tetrahydroisoquinoline-based ligand for PET imaging of C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 in an animal model of glioblastoma,"Piyapan Suwattananuruk, Sukanya Yaset, Chanisa Chotipanich, Angel Moldes-Anaya, Rune Sundset, Rodrigo Berzaghi, Stine Figenschau, Sandra Claes, Dominique Schols, Pornchai Rojsitthisak, Mathias Kranz, Opa Vajragupta","Background: This study aimed to develop a novel positron emission tomography (PET) tracer, [68Ga]Ga-TD-01, for CXCR4 imaging. To achieve this goal, the molecular scaffold of TIQ15 was tuned by conjugation with the DOTA chelator to make it suitable for68Ga radiolabeling.

Methods: A bifunctional chelator was prepared by conjugating the amine group of TIQ15 with p-NCS-Bz-DOTA, yielding TD-01, with a high yield (68.92%). TD-01 was then radiolabeled with68Ga using 0.1 M ammonium acetate at 60 °C for 10 min. A 1-h dynamic small animal PET/MRI study of the labeled compound in GL261-luc2 tumor-bearing mice was performed, and brain tumor uptake was assessed. Blocking studies involved pre-administration of TIQ15 (10 mg/kg) 10 min before the PET procedure started.

Results: [68Ga]Ga-TD-01 exhibited a radiochemical yield (RCY) of 36.33 ± 1.50% (EOS), with a radiochemical purity > 99% and a molar activity of 55.79 ± 1.96 GBq/µmol (EOS). The radiotracer showed in vitro stability in PBS and human plasma for over 4 h. Biodistribution studies in healthy animals revealed favorable kinetics for subsequent PET pharmacokinetic modeling with low uptake in the brain and moderate uptake in lungs, intestines and spleen. Elimination could be assigned to a renal-hepatic pathway as showed by high uptake in kidneys, liver, and urinary bladder. Importantly, [68Ga]Ga-TD-01 uptake in glioblastoma (GBM)-bearing mice significantly decreased upon competition with TIQ15, with a baseline tumor-to-background ratios > 2.5 (20 min p.i.), indicating high specificity.

Conclusion: The newly developed CXCR4 PET tracer, [68Ga]Ga-TD-01, exhibited a high binding inhibition for CXCR4, excellent in vitro stability, and favorable pharmacokinetics, suggesting that the compound is a promising candidate for full in vivo characterization of CXCR4 expression in GBM, with potential for further development as a tool in cancer diagnosis.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39162901/

The outcome of a PET study can, however, potentially be obscured by suboptimal and/or inconsistent choices made in complex processing pipelines required to reach a quantitative estimate of radioligand binding. Variations in subject selection, experimental design, data acquisition, preprocessing, and statistical analysis may lead to different outcomes and neurobiological interpretations. We here review the approaches used in 105 original research articles published by 21 different PET centres, using the tracer [11C]DASB for quantification of cerebral serotonin transporter binding, as an exemplary case. We highlight and quantify the impact of the remarkable variety of ways in which researchers are currently conducting their studies, while implicitly expecting generalizable results across research groups. Our review provides evidence that the foundation for a given choice of a preprocessing pipeline seems to be an overlooked aspect in modern PET neuroscience.

Successive positron emission tomography measurement of cerebral blood flow and neuroreceptors in the human brain: an 11C-SA4503 study,"Kiichi Ishiwata, Kenji Ishii, Yuichi Kimura, Kazunori Kawamura, Keiichi Oda, Toru Sasaki, Muneyuki Sakata, Michio Senda","For evaluating a newly developed radioligand for positron emission tomography (PET), successive measurements of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and the kinetics of the radioligand in the same subject are preferable in the first clinical trial. In this study, we demonstrate an example for the study of (11)C-labeled 1-(3,4-dimethoxyphenethyl)-4-(3-phenylprophyl) piperazine ((11)C-SA4503) for mapping sigma(1) receptors in the human brain. Five healthy male subjects underwent two successive PET scans with (15)O-H(2)O to measure the rCBF and with (11)C-SA4503 (dynamic 60-min scan). The brain kinetics of (11)C-SA4503 was evaluated using the time-activity curve (TAC) of tissue in each of the 11 regions of the brain and the metabolite-corrected TAC of plasma on the basis of a two-tissue compartment fourparameter model. The estimated parameters were four rate constants: K (1), influx from plasma to brain tissue; k (2), efflux from tissue to plasma; k (3), association between tracer and receptors; and k (4), dissociation of tracer-receptor complex, and the binding potential (BP), k (3)/k (4). (11)CSA4503 was distributed all over the brain, and the TACs exhibited an accumulation pattern in all the 11 regions. K (1) of (11)C-SA4503 correlated with rCBF, but the other three rate constant parameters and BP did not. The regional difference in the BP of (11)C-SA4503 is compatible with those of sigma(1) receptors. In conclusion, successive PET measurements of rCBF and the brain kinetics of radioligand-neuroreceptor binding are useful for the first clinical trial of a newly developed radioligand for mapping neuroreceptors, and the protocol is applicable to pathophysiological studies of brain disorders.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18600419/
Use of positron emission tomography in animal research,"S R Cherry, S S Gambhir","Among the several imaging technologies applied to in vivo studies of research animals, positron emission tomography (PET) is a nuclear imaging technique that permits the spatial and temporal distribution of compounds labeled with a positron-emitting radionuclide to be determined noninvasively. It can be viewed as an in vivo analog of classic autoradiographic methods. Many different positron-labeled compounds have been synthesized as tracers that target a range of specific markers or pathways. These tracers permit the measurement of quantities of biological interest ranging from glucose metabolism to gene expression. PET has been extensively used in imaging studies of larger research animals such as dogs and nonhuman primates. Now, using newly developed high-resolution dedicated animal PET scanners, these types of studies can be performed in small laboratory animals such as mice and rats. The entire whole-body biodistribution kinetics can be determined in a single imaging study in a single animal. This technique should enable statistically significant biodistribution data to be obtained from a handful of animals, compared with the tens or hundreds of animals that might be required for a similar study by autoradiography. PET also enables repeat studies in a single subject, facilitating longitudinal study designs and permitting each animal to serve as its own control in experiments designed to evaluate the effects of a particular interventional strategy. This paper provides a basic overview of the methodology of PET imaging, a discussion of the advantages and drawbacks of PET as a tool in animal research, a description of the latest generation of dedicated animal PET scanners, and a review of a few of the many applications of PET in animal research to date.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11406721/
Renal blood flow measurement by positron emission tomography using 15O-labeled water,"L Juillard, M F Janier, D Fouque, M Lionnet, D Le Bars, L Cinotti, P Barthez, C Gharib, M Laville","Background: Only few noninvasive methods have the potential to quantitate renal blood flow (RBF) in humans. Positron emission tomography (PET) is a clinical imaging method that can be used to measure the tissue blood flow noninvasively. The purpose of this study was to validate PET measurement of RBF using 15O-labeled water (H215O), a tracer that allows repeated measurements at short time intervals.

Methods: RBF was measured in six pigs by PET and by radioactive microspheres (MS). Three measurements were performed in each pig at baseline (BL), during vascular expansion and dopamine infusion (DA; 20 microg. kg-1. min-1 intravenously), and during angiotensin II (Ang II) infusion (50 ng. kg-1. min-1 intravenously). RBF was estimated from aortic and renal tracer kinetics using a model adapted from the blood flow model described by Kety and Smith.

Results: PET and MS values correlated strongly (y = 0.79x + 42, r = 0.93, P < 0.0001) over the RBF range from 100 to 500 mL. min-1. 100 g-1. Pharmacologically induced changes were significant and were measured equally well by PET and MS: 38 and 39%, respectively, below BL (P < 0.005 and P < 0.05) under Ang II, and 47 and 48%, respectively, above BL (P < 0.005 and P < 0.01) under DA. A Bland and Altman representation showed a low average difference of -17 +/- 45 mL. min-1. 100 g-1 (mean +/- SD).

Conclusion: To our knowledge, this study provides the first validation of RBF measurement by PET using H215O over a large range of RBF values (100 to 500 mL. min-1. 100 g-1), which correspond to RBF values in both healthy subjects and in patients suffering from chronic renal failure.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10844620/
Repeatability of tumor blood flow quantification with 82Rubidium PET/CT in prostate cancer - a test-retest study,"Mads Ryø Jochumsen, Kirsten Bouchelouche, Katrine Bødkergaard Nielsen, Jørgen Frøkiær, Michael Borre, Jens Sörensen, Lars Poulsen Tolbod","Background: Non-invasive tumor blood flow (TBF) quantification is a candidate approach for risk stratification and monitoring of prostate cancer patients. Validation data have recently been published on prostate TBF measurement with the widely used positron emission tomography (PET) flow tracer82Rubidium (82Rb). However, no test-retest data is available for TBF measurement with82Rb PET in prostate cancer. Such information is important to determine the potential clinical usefulness of the technique. The aim of the present study was to determine the test-retest repeatability of TBF measurement with both dynamic and static82Rb PET.

Methods: We recruited 10 low-to-high-risk prostate cancer patients scheduled for clinical prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET/computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging. Pelvic and cardiac static and dynamic82Rb PET/CT were performed at baseline and repeated on a different day within 1 week. In total, 11 primary lesions were analyzed.

Results: For K1, standardized uptake values (SUV)max, SUVmean, and SUVpeak, prostate cancer82Rb PET TBF has a repeatability of 32%, 51%, 53%, and 58% and an intraclass correlation of 0.98, 0.89, 0.88, and 0.88, respectively.

Conclusion: Dynamic82Rb PET/CT with kinetic modeling measures TBF in prostate cancer with high repeatability, which allows identification of blood flow changes of 32%.

PGN650 was labeled with124I to create a positron emission tomography (PET) agent as an in vivo biomarker for tumor microenvironment and response to therapy. In this phase 0 study, we evaluated the pharmacokinetics, safety, radiation dosimetry, and tumor targeting of this tracer in a cohort of patients with cancer.

Methods: Eleven patients with known solid tumors received approximately 140 MBq (3.8 mCi)124I-PGN650 intravenously and underwent positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET/CT) approximately 1 hour, 3 hours, and either 24 hours or 48 hours later to establish tracer kinetics for the purpose of calculating radiation dosimetry (from integration of the organ time-activity curves and OLINDA/EXM using the adult male and female models).

Results: Known tumor foci demonstrated mildly increased uptake, with the highest activity at the latest imaging time. There were no unexpected adverse events. The liver was the organ receiving the highest radiation dose (0.77 mGy/MBq); the effective dose was 0.41 mSv/MBq.

Conclusion: Although124I-PGN650 is safe for human PET imaging, the tumor targeting with this agent in patients was less than previously observed in animal studies.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29037107/
A general algorithm for optimal sampling schedule design in nuclear medicine imaging,"X Li, D Feng, K Wong","Optimal sampling schedule (OSS) is of great interest in biomedical experiment design, as it can improve the physiological parameter estimation precision and significantly reduce the samples required. A number of well designed algorithms and software packages have been developed, which deal with the instantaneous measurements at discrete times. However, in nuclear medicine tracer kinetic studies, the imaging systems, such as positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), take measurements (images) based on continuous accumulation over time intervals. In this case, the existing algorithms cannot be used to design OSS so as to reduce the image frame numbers. In this paper, a general OSS design algorithm for the accumulative measurement is proposed. The potential usefulness of the algorithm is demonstrated by its designing OSS in [18F] fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) studies with PET to estimate the local cerebral metabolic rate of glucose. The robustness of parameter estimation using the OSS with respect to intra-subject and inter-subject parameter variations is also presented.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11223150/
(18)F-Deoxyglucose (FDG) kinetics evaluated by a non-compartment model based on a linear regression function using a computer based simulation: correlation with the parameters of the two-tissue compartment model,"Ludwig G Strauss, Leyun Pan, Caixia Cheng, Antonia Dimitrakopoulou-Strauss","Parametric imaging with a linear regression function of the tracer activity curve fit is a non-compartmental method, which can be used for the evaluation of dynamic PET (dPET) studies. However, the dependency of the slope of the regression function fit on the (18)F-Deoxyglucose (FDG) 2-tissue compartment parameters (vb, k1-k4) is not known yet. This study is focused on the impact of the 2-tissue compartment parameters on the slope of the curve. A data base of 1760 dynamic PET FDG studies with the corresponding 2-tissue compartment model parameter solutions were available and used to calculate synthetic time-activity data based on the 2-tissue compartment model. The input curve was calculated from the median values of the input curves of the 1760 dynamic data sets. Then, sequentially each of the five parameters (vb, k1-k4) of the 2-tissue compartment model was varied from 0.1 to 0.9 and tracer activity curves were calculated (60000 curves/parameter). A linear regression function was fitted to these curves. The comparison of the slope values of the regression function with the corresponding compartment data revealed a primary dependency on k3, which is associated with the intracellular phosphorylation of FDG. The squared correlation coefficient was high with r(2)=0.9716, which refers to 97 % explained variance of the data. k2 and vb had only a minor impact, while k1 and k4 had no impact on the slope values. The results demonstrate, that k3 has a major impact on the slope values calculated by the linear regression function.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23145361/
Extracellular domain shedding influences specific tumor uptake and organ distribution of the EGFR PET tracer 89Zr-imgatuzumab,"Martin Pool, Arjan Kol, Marjolijn N Lub-de Hooge, Christian A Gerdes, Steven de Jong, Elisabeth G E de Vries, Anton G T Terwisscha van Scheltinga","Preclinical positron emission tomography (PET) imaging revealed a mismatch between in vivo epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression and EGFR antibody tracer tumor uptake. Shed EGFR ectodomain (sEGFR), which is present in cancer patient sera, can potentially bind tracer and therefore influence tracer kinetics. To optimize EGFR-PET, we examined the influence of sEGFR levels on tracer kinetics and tumor uptake of EGFR monoclonal antibody 89Zr-imgatuzumab in varying xenograft models. Human cancer cell lines A431 (EGFR overexpressing, epidermoid), A549 and H441 (both EGFR medium expressing, non-small cell lung cancer) were xenografted in mice. Xenografted mice received 10, 25 or 160 μg 89Zr-imgatuzumab, co-injected with equal doses 111In-IgG control. MicroPET scans were made 24, 72 and 144 h post injection, followed by biodistribution analysis. sEGFR levels in liver and plasma samples were determined by ELISA. 89Zr-imgatuzumab uptake in A431 tumors was highest (29.8 ± 5.4 %ID/g) in the 160 μg dose group. Contrary, highest uptake in A549 and H441 tumors was found at the lowest (10 μg) 89Zr-imgatuzumab dose. High 89Zr-imgatuzumab liver accumulation was found in A431 xenografted mice, which decreased with antibody dose increments. 89Zr-imgatuzumab liver uptake in A549 and H441 xenografted mice was low at all doses. sEGFR levels in liver and plasma of A431 bearing mice were up to 1000-fold higher than levels found in A549, H441 and non-tumor xenografted mice. 89Zr-imgatuzumab effectively visualizes EGFR-expressing tumors. High sEGFR levels can redirect 89Zr-imgatuzumab to the liver, in which case tumor visualization can be improved by increasing tracer antibody dose.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27602494/
Direct 4-D PET list mode parametric reconstruction with a novel EM algorithm,"Jianhua Yan, Beata Planeta-Wilson, Richard E Carson","The production of images of kinetic parameters is often the ultimate goal of positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. The indirect method of PET parametric imaging, also called the frame-based method (FM), is performed by fitting the time-activity curve (TAC) for each voxel with an appropriate compartment model after image reconstruction. The indirect method is simple and easily implemented, however, it usually leads to some loss of accuracy or precision, due to the use of two separate steps. This paper presents a direct 4-D method for producing 3-D images of kinetic parameters from list mode PET data. In this application, the TAC for each voxel is described by a one-tissue compartment model (1T). Extending previous EM algorithms, a new spatiotemporal complete data space was introduced to optimize the maximum likelihood function. This leads to a straightforward closed-form parametric image update equation. This method was implemented by extending the current list mode platform MOLAR to produce a parametric algorithm PMOLAR-1T. Using an ordered subset approach, qualitative and quantitative evaluations were performed using 2-D (x, t) and 4-D (x, y, z, t) simulated list mode data based on brain receptor tracers and also with a human brain study. Comparisons with the indirect method showed that the proposed direct method can lead to accurate estimation of the parametric image values with reduced variance, especially at low count levels. In the 2-D test, the direct method showed similar bias to the frame-based method but with variance reduction of 23%-60%. In the 4-D test, bias values of both methods were no more than 4% and the direct method had lower variability (coefficient of variation reduction of 0%-64% compared to the frame-based method) at the normal count level. The direct method had a larger reduction in variability (27%-81%) and lower bias (1%-5% for 4-D and 1%-19% for FM) at low count levels. The results in the human brain study are similar with PMOLAR-1T showing lower noise than FM.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22929383/
Quantitative measurement of regional cerebral blood flow and oxygen metabolism in a rat model of cerebral hypoperfusion,"Hiroki Kato, Yasukazu Kanai, Tadashi Watabe, Hayato Ikeda, Genki Horitsugi, Jun Hatazawa","This study was aimed at evaluating the regional changes in the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) in relation to the cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCAO) rat model. Ligation of the bilateral common carotid arteries (or a sham operation in control animals) was performed in 10-week-old male Wistar rats. O-15 PET images were acquired in the subacute phase (1 week after the surgery) and chronic phase (6 weeks after the surgery) with the animals under anesthesia, using a small-animal PET system and the O-15 gas steady-state inhalation method with arterial blood sampling developed in our previous study. Histopathological staining by Klüver-Barrera method and immunocytochemistry staining by glial fibrillary acidic protein were performed. Cognitive function was tested by using the apparatus of Y-maze. Significantly lower CBF and higher oxygen extraction fraction were observed in broad areas of the cerebrum in the subacute phase in the BCAO rats, with recovery in the chronic phase. A stable decrease of the CMRO2in the subacute phase of arterial occlusion and later was observed in the BCAO rat model, mainly in the anterior cerebral artery territory. Atrophy and rarefaction of corpus callosum were found in the BCAO in the chronic phase. Activity of astrocytes in the BCAO was prominent in the both phases. Working memory was impaired in the BCAO in the chronic phase. Regional changes in cerebral perfusion and oxygen metabolism in the subacute and chronic phases of arterial occlusion were clarified in a rat model of BCAO by quantitative O-15 PET based on the steady-state method.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31132338/
Structure--activity relationship and preclinical evaluation of carbon-11-labeled ammonium salts as PET--myocardial perfusion imaging agents,"Ohad Ilovich, Galith Abourbeh, Moshe Bocher, Nanette Freedman, Hana Billauer, Sharon Dotan, Haim D Danenberg, Eyal Mishani","Background: Due to the limited availability of suitable positron emission tomography (PET) tracers, the majority of myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) scans is performed using SPECT rather than PET.

Aim: The aim of this study is to design and synthesize carbon-11-labeled ammonium salt derivatives and explore their structure–activity relationship (SAR) and their potential as PET–MPI agents.

Methods and results: Three carbon-11-labeled ammonium salts were developed. SAR of the labeled compounds were explored vis-à-vis the effects of charge density and lipophilicity on the distribution kinetics in mice. These studies pointed at [11C]4 as the lead compound. Comparative microPET/CT scans in healthy rats, using both [11C]4 and [13 N]–NH3, substantiated the potential of [11C]4 ([11C]-DMDPA). A proof of concept for the potential of radiolabeled ammonium salts as MPI agents has been demonstrated in a newly developed swine model of permanent partial coronary artery occlusion.

Conclusions: SAR studies of 11C-labeled ammonium salts suggest that both lipophilicity and charge density affect the performance of these compounds as MPI probes. In a swine model, the labeled lead successfully visualized the defect regions in the myocardium. The data presented call for the development of fluorine-18 analogues, to increase clinical impact.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22290562/

"Advancements, Challenges, and Future Prospects in Clinical Hyperpolarized Magnetic Resonance Imaging: A Comprehensive Review","Ching-Yi Hsieh, Ying-Chieh Lai, Kuan-Ying Lu, Gigin Lin","Hyperpolarized (HP) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a groundbreaking imaging platform advancing from research to clinical practice, offering new possibilities for real-time, non-invasive metabolic imaging. This review explores the latest advancements, challenges, and future directions of HP MRI, emphasizing its transformative impact on both translational research and clinical applications. By employing techniques such as dissolution Dynamic Nuclear Polarization (dDNP), Parahydrogen-Induced Polarization (PHIP), Signal Amplification by Reversible Exchange (SABRE), and Spin-Exchange Optical Pumping (SEOP), HP MRI achieves enhanced nuclear spin polarization, enabling in vivo visualization of metabolic pathways with exceptional sensitivity. Current challenges, such as limited imaging windows, complex pre-scan protocols, and data processing difficulties, are addressed through innovative solutions like advanced pulse sequences, bolus tracking, and kinetic modeling. We highlight the evolution of HP MRI technology, focusing on its potential to revolutionize disease diagnosis and monitoring by revealing metabolic processes beyond the reach of conventional MRI and positron emission tomography (PET). Key advancements include the development of novel tracers like [2-13C]pyruvate and [1-13C]-alpha-ketoglutarate and improved data analysis techniques, broadening the scope of clinical metabolic imaging. Future prospects emphasize integrating artificial intelligence, standardizing imaging protocols, and developing new hyperpolarized agents to enhance reproducibility and expand clinical capabilities particularly in oncology, cardiology, and neurology.

Functional imaging of neurotransmitter systems in movement disorders,N Ilgin,"PET and SPECT enable the direct measurement of components of the dopaminergic and other systems in the living human brain and offer unique opportunity for the in vivo quantification of the dopaminergic function in PD and other movement disorders. The need to establish the early and differential diagnosis of PD is increasingly important given the recent evidence that early pharmacologic intervention may slow progression of this progressive degenerative disease. Accordingly, imaging with PET and SPECT using specific neuromarkers has been increasingly important to biochemically identify the loss of specific neurotransmitters, their synthesizing enzymes and their receptors in movement disorders. Through the parallel development of new radiotracers, kinetic models and better instruments, PET and SPECT technology is enabling investigation of increasingly more complex aspects of the human brain neurotransmitter systems. This paper summarizes the results of different PET-SPECT studies used to evaluate the various elements of the dopamine system in the human brain with PET and intends to introduce the newly emerging specific tracers and their applications to clinical research in movement disorders.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9796366/
Phosphodiesterase 10A PET radioligand development program: from pig to human,"Christophe Plisson, David Weinzimmer, Steen Jakobsen, Sridhar Natesan, Cristian Salinas, Shu-Fei Lin, David Labaree, Ming-Qiang Zheng, Nabeel Nabulsi, Tiago Reis Marques, Shitij Kapur, Eiji Kawanishi, Takeaki Saijo, Roger N Gunn, Richard E Carson, Eugenii A Rabiner","Four novel phosphodiesterase 10A (PDE10A) PET tracers have been synthesized, characterized in preclinical studies, and compared with the previously reported (11)C-MP-10.

Methods: On the basis of in vitro data, IMA102, IMA104, IMA107, and IMA106 were identified as potential PDE10A radioligand candidates and labeled with either (11)C via N-methylation or with (18)F through an SN2 reaction, in the case of IMA102. These candidates were compared with (11)C-MP-10 in pilot in vivo studies in the pig brain. On the basis of these data, (11)C-IMA106 and (11)C-IMA107 were taken into further evaluation and comparison with (11)C-MP-10 in the primate brain. Finally, the most promising radioligand candidate was progressed into human evaluation.

Results: All 5 tracers were produced with good radiochemical yield and specific activity. All candidates readily entered the brain and demonstrated a heterogeneous distribution consistent with the known expression of PDE10A. Baseline PET studies in the pig and baboon showed that (11)C-IMA107 and (11)C-MP-10 displayed the most favorable tissue kinetics and imaging properties. The administration of selective PDE10A inhibitors reduced the binding of (11)C-IMA107 and (11)C-MP-10 in the PDE10A-rich brain regions, in a dose-dependent manner. In the nonhuman primate brain, the tissue kinetics of (11)C-IMA107 and (11)C-MP-10 were well described by a 2-tissue-compartment model, allowing robust estimates of the regional total volume of distribution. Blockade with unlabeled MP-10 confirmed the suitability of the cerebellum as a reference tissue and enabled the estimation of regional binding potential as the outcome measure of specific binding.

Conclusion: (11)C-IMA107 was identified as the ligand with the highest binding potential while still possessing reversible kinetics. The first human administration of (11)C-IMA107 has demonstrated the expected regional distribution and suitably fast kinetics, indicating that (11)C-IMA107 will be a useful tool for the investigation of PDE10A status in the living human brain.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24614221/
Volume-of-interest-based supervised cluster analysis for pseudo-reference region selection in [18F]DPA-714 PET imaging of the rat brain,"Igor Fagner Vieira, Dieter Ory, Cindy Casteels, Fernando R A Lima, Koen Van Laere, Guy Bormans, Michel Koole","Method: Aim of this study was to automatically select a suitable pseudo-reference brain region for the accurate, non-invasive quantification of neuroinflammation in a rat brain using dynamic [18F]DPA-714 PET imaging.

Procedures: A supervised clustering analysis approach considering three kinetic classes (SVCA3) was used to select an appropriate pseudo-reference brain region. This pseudo-reference region was determined by selecting only brain regions with low specific tracer uptake (SVCA3low) or by taking into account all brain regions and weighting each brain region with the corresponding fraction of low specific binding (SVCA3wlow). Both SVCA3 approaches were evaluated in an animal model of neuro-inflammation induced by lipopolysaccharide injection in the right striatum of female Wistar rats. For this study setup, a population of 25 female Wistar rats received a dynamic PET scan after injection of ~ 60 MBq [18F]DPA-714. Animals were scanned at baseline (n = 3) and at different time points after inducing neuroinflammation: 1 day (n = 3), 3 days (n = 12), 7 days (n = 4), and 30 days (n = 3). Binding potential (BP) values using a simplified reference tissue model (SRTM) and the contralateral striatum as pseudo-reference region were considered as a reference method (BPL STR) and compared with SRTM BP values using a pseudo-reference region obtained by either the SVCA3lowor SVCA3wlowapproach for both a 90- and 120-min acquisition time interval.

Results: For the right striatum, SRTM BP values using a SVCA3low- or SVCA3wlow-based pseudo-reference region demonstrated a strong and highly significant correlation with SRTM BPL STRvalues (Spearman r ≥ 0.89, p < 0.001). For the SVCA3lowapproach, Friedman tests revealed no significant difference with SRTM BPL STRvalues for a 120-min acquisition time while small but signification differences were found for a 90-min acquisition time (p < 0.05). For the SVCA3wlowapproach, highly signification differences (p < 0.001) were found with SRTM BPL STRvalues for both a 90- and 120-min acquisition time interval.

Conclusions: A SVCA3 approach using three kinetic classes allowed the automatic selection of pseudo-reference brain regions with low specific tracer binding for accurate and non-invasive quantification of rat brain PET imaging using [18F]DPA-714. A shorter acquisition time interval of 90 min can be considered with only limited impact on the SVCA3-based selection of the pseudo-reference brain regions.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30588554/
Preliminary evaluation of 15-[18F]fluoro-3-oxa-pentadecanoate as a PET tracer of hepatic fatty acid oxidation,"T R DeGrado, S Wang, D C Rockey","The liver is an important site of fat oxidation. Abnormalities of hepatic mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation (HMFAO) are associated with obesity, type II diabetes, alcoholic hepatitis, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Noninvasive assessment of HMFAO by PET has been impeded by the lack of a specific radiotracer.

Methods: No-carrier-added 15-[18F]fluoro-3-oxa-pentadecanoate (FOP) was synthesized and evaluated in living rats and isolated rat livers.

Results: FOP showed high uptake and slow clearance of radioactivity from livers in living rats. Inhibition of HMFAO by pretreatment of fasting rats with the carnitine palmitoyltransferase-I (CPT-I) inhibitor reduced the liver-to-blood ratio by 64%. In isolated rat livers, perfused in normoxic (95% O2) and hypoxic (15% O2) conditions with glucose (5 mmol/L) and palmitate (0.15 mmol/L), the externally measured kinetics of FOP showed reversible binding in tissue. The kinetics were adequately fit by a catenary 2-compartment model for estimation of tracer distribution volumes (DVs). The DVs of both compartments were found to correlate with fractional palmitate oxidation rate (FPOR) in experiments in normoxic and hypoxic conditions. The correlation was particularly strong for the slower second compartment (DV2 [mL/g dry weight] = 34.1 FPOR [mL/min/g dry weight] - 0.7, r = 0.89). Relatively small levels of diffusible metabolites of FOP were formed in vivo and in isolated rat liver.

Conclusion: The selective uptake of FOP by liver and the high sensitivity of hepatic FOP DV to changes of HMFAO with CPT-I inhibition and hypoxia suggests potential usefulness for the 3-oxa fatty acid analog in assessments of hepatic mitochondrial oxidation of exogenous fatty acids with PET. These data emphasize that further studies are required to clarify the intracellular disposition of FOP in the liver and test its validity as a tracer of HMFAO over a broad range of conditions.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11038005/
PET imaging for gene & cell therapy,"Sara A Collins, Kei Hiraoka, Akihito Inagaki, Noriyuki Kasahara, Mark Tangney","As the interest in gene therapy increases, the development of an efficient and reliable means to monitor gene delivery and expression in patients is becoming more important. An ideal imaging modality would be non-invasive, allowing for repeated imaging, thus validating stages subsequent to vector administration and allowing for the improvement of clinical protocols. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) has been employed for some time in clinical imaging and has in more recent years been adapted to enable imaging in small animal models, including gene therapy models for a range of diseases. PET imaging is based on the detection of trace quantities of positron-emitting molecular probe within cells postadministration, permitting imaging of target molecules in vivo, and numerous tracers have been developed for a wide range of applications, including imaging of reporter gene activity. Use of radiolabelled substrates that interact with specific transgene proteins, has identified a number of reporter genes that are suitable for imaging vector mediated gene delivery and expression in both pre-clinical and clinical situations. These reporter genes enable non-invasive analysis of the location, level and kinetics of transgene activity. Among the various imaging modalities in existence, the PET approach displays arguably the optimum characteristics in terms of sensitivity and quantitation for in vivo gene expression measurements. Given the existing availability of PET scanning equipment and expertise in hospitals, this imaging modality represents the most clinically applicable means of analysing gene therapy in patients. This review outlines the principles of PET imaging in the context of gene and cell therapy at both pre-clinical and clinical levels, comparing PET with other relevant modalities, and describes the progress to date in this field.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22263921/
The P2X7 receptor tracer [11C]SMW139 as an in vivo marker of neuroinflammation in multiple sclerosis: a first-in man study,"Marloes H J Hagens, Sandeep S V Golla, Bieneke Janssen, Danielle J Vugts, Wissam Beaino, Albert D Windhorst, James O'Brien-Brown, Michael Kassiou, Robert C Schuit, Lothar A Schwarte, Helga E de Vries, Joep Killestein, Frederik Barkhof, Bart N M van Berckel, Adriaan A Lammertsma","Purpose: The novel PET tracer [11C]SMW139 binds with high affinity to the P2X7receptor, which is expressed on pro-inflammatory microglia. The purposes of this first in-man study were to characterise pharmacokinetics of [11C]SMW139 in patients with active relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and healthy controls (HC) and to evaluate its potential to identify in vivo neuroinflammation in RRMS.

Methods: Five RRMS patients and 5 age-matched HC underwent 90-min dynamic [11C]SMW139 PET scans, with online continuous and manual arterial sampling to generate a metabolite-corrected arterial plasma input function. Tissue time activity curves were fitted to single- and two-tissue compartment models, and the model that provided the best fits was determined using the Akaike information criterion.

Results: The optimal model for describing [11C]SMW139 kinetics in both RRMS and HC was a reversible two-tissue compartment model with blood volume parameter and with the dissociation rate k4fixed to the whole-brain value. Exploratory group level comparisons demonstrated an increased volume of distribution (VT) and binding potential (BPND) in RRMS compared with HC in normal appearing brain regions. BPNDin MS lesions was decreased compared with non-lesional white matter, and a further decrease was observed in gadolinium-enhancing lesions. In contrast, increased VTwas observed in enhancing lesions, possibly resulting from disruption of the blood-brain barrier in active MS lesions. In addition, there was a high correlation between parameters obtained from 60- to 90-min datasets, although analyses using 60-min data led to a slight underestimation in regional VTand BPNDvalues.

Conclusions: This first in-man study demonstrated that uptake of [11C]SMW139 can be quantified with PET using BPNDas a measure for specific binding in healthy controls and RRMS patients. Additional studies are warranted for further clinical evaluation of this novel neuroinflammation tracer.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31705174/
Human brain mapping under increasing cognitive complexity using regional cerebral blood flow measurements and positron emission tomography,Ian Law,"Measurement of the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) is an important parameter in the evaluation of cerebral function. With positron emission tomography (PET) rCBF has predominantly been quantified using the short-lived radiotracer oxygen-15 labelled water (H 2 15 O) and an adaptation of the Kety one-tissue compartment autoradiographic model. The values attained in putative grey matter, however, are systematically underestimated because of the limited scanner resolution. For this reason we applied a dynamic kinetic two-tissue compartment model including a fast and a slow flow component each with a perfusable tissue fraction. In the fast component rCBF was 2-2.5 times greater than grey matter values using traditional autoradiography in both human and monkey. Visual stimulation in human gave a corrected rCBF increase of approximately 40%. Visual stimulation was also used to indirectly validate carbon-10 labelled carbondioxide ( 10 CO 2 ), a new very short-lived rCBF PET tracer with a half-life of only 19.3 seconds. This allowed an increase in the number of independent PET scans per subject from 12-14 using H 2 15 O to 64 using 10 CO 2 . The experiment demonstrated a maximal activation response in the visual cortex at a 10-15 Hz stimulation frequency. The use of the rCBF PET mapping technique is illustrated by studies of the organization of language and the oculomotor system. With respect to the former, we found confirmation of neuropsychological evidence of the involvement of the left supramarginal/angular gyrus in reading in Japanese of a phonologically based script system, Kana, and of the left posterior inferior temporal gyrus in reading of a morphogram based script system, Kanji. Concerning the organization of the oculomotor system we found overlapping areas in fronto-parietal cortex involved in maintaining visual fixation, and performing visually guided and imagined eye movements. These data show that overt eye movements are not a prerequisite of the activation of classical cortical oculomotor regions and underscore the involvement of these areas in other behaviours such as visual attention and saccade inhibition. During eye movements in the dark an increased activation response in the parieto-occipital cortex can be found. This can be interpreted as effects of the gaze-sensitive neurons that are used to objectively localize objects relative to the body, and efferent copies of motor commands, used to predict the visual consequences of eye movements to maintain visual continuity. Defect efferent copies are in some neurobiological models of schizophrenia thought to contribute to passivity phenomena. The clinical perspective of brain mapping techniques is to preoperatively locate eloquent areas, e.g. motor function, language, and memory, allowing the achievement of optimal neurosurgical resection with the preservation of neurological function.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18208679/
Binding of the D3-preferring antipsychotic candidate F17464 to dopamine D3 and D2 receptors: a PET study in healthy subjects with [11C]-(+)-PHNO,"Mark Slifstein, Anissa Abi-Dargham, Ragy R Girgis, Raymond F Suckow, Thomas B Cooper, Chaitanya R Divgi, Pierre Sokoloff, Ludovic Leriche, Patrick Carberry, Shunichi Oya, Simon K Joseph, Marlène Guiraud, Agnès Montagne, Valérie Brunner, Florence Gaudoux, Françoise Tonner","Rationale: F17464, a dopamine D3 receptor antagonist with relatively high D3 selectivity (70 fold vs D2 in vitro), exhibits an antipsychotic profile in preclinical studies, and therapeutic efficacy was demonstrated in a randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial in patients with schizophrenia (Bitter et al. Neuropsychopharmacology 44(11):1917-1924, 2019).

Objective: This open-label study in healthy male subjects aimed at characterizing F17464 binding to D3/D2 receptors and the time course of receptor occupancy using positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with a D3-preferring tracer, [11C]-(+)-PHNO.

Methods: PET scans were performed at baseline and following a single 30 mg or 15 mg dose of F17464 (3 subjects/dose), and blood samples were collected for pharmacokinetic analysis. Receptor occupancy was calculated based upon reduction in binding potential of the tracer following F17464 administration. The relationship between plasma F17464 concentration and D3/D2 receptor occupancy was modeled and the plasma concentration corresponding to 50% receptor occupancy (EC50) calculated.

Results: Both doses of F17464 robustly blocked [11C]-(+)-PHNO D3 receptor binding, with substantial occupancy from 1 h post-administration, which increased at 6-9 h (89-98% and 79-87% for the 30 mg and 15 mg groups, respectively) and remained detectable at 22 h. In contrast, D2 binding was only modestly blocked at all time points (< 18%). F17464 exhibited a combination of rapid peripheral kinetics and hysteresis (persistence of binding 22 h post-dose despite low plasma concentration).

Use of a Tracer-Specific Deep Artificial Neural Net to Denoise Dynamic PET Images,"Ivan S Klyuzhin, Ju-Chieh Cheng, Connor Bevington, Vesna Sossi","Application of kinetic modeling (KM) on a voxel level in dynamic PET images frequently suffers from high levels of noise, drastically reducing the precision of parametric image analysis. In this paper, we investigate the use of machine learning and artificial neural networks to denoise dynamic PET images. We train a deep denoising autoencoder (DAE) using noisy and noise-free spatiotemporal image patches, extracted from the simulated images of [11C]raclopride, a dopamine D2receptor agonist. The DAE-processed dynamic and corresponding parametric images (simulated and acquired) are compared with those obtained with conventional denoising techniques, including temporal and spatial Gaussian smoothing, iterative spatiotemporal smoothing/deconvolution, and the highly constrained backprojection processing (HYPR). The simulated (acquired) parametric image non-uniformity was 7.75% (19.49%) with temporal and 5.90% (14.50%) with spatial smoothing, 5.82% (16.21%) with smoothing/deconvolution, 5.49% (13.38%) with HYPR, and 3.52% (11.41%) with DAE. The DAE also produced the best results in terms of the coefficient of variation of voxel values and structural similarity index. Denoising-induced bias in the regional mean binding potential was 7.8% with temporal and 26.31% with spatial smoothing, 28.61% with smoothing/deconvolution, 27.63% with HYPR, and 14.8% with DAE. When the test data did not match the training data, erroneous outcomes were obtained. Our results demonstrate that a deep DAE can provide a substantial reduction in the voxel-level noise compared with the conventional spatiotemporal denoising methods while introducing a similar or lower amount of bias. The better DAE performance comes at the cost of lower generality and requiring appropriate training data.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31283475/
Evaluation of a commercial radiochromatography module as an arterial blood activity monitor,"C M Laymon, D Sashin, J P Carney, J Ruszkiewicz, D Altenburger, C R Becker, B J Lopresti, N S Mason, J M Mountz, J C Price, R Schavey, C A Mathis","Input functions required for positron emission tomography (PET) tracer kinetic modeling are often obtained from arterial blood. In some situations, using short-lived radiotracers, e.g. [(15)O]water, rapid sample handling is required. A method used at several facilities is to pump blood through a detector system at a constant rate. We investigate the suitability of a commercial radiochromatography module (IN/US Posi-RAM) for this new use. The Posi-RAM consists of two 2.5 cm (length) x 2.5 cm (diameter) cylindrical bismuth germanate (BGO) detectors that can operate in coincidence mode. Arterial blood is transported through the system via a length of tubing with flow rate controlled by a peristalsis pump. A custom-counting loop and support frame were designed for the Posi-RAM for PET studies. System sensitivity was determined to be 1.1 x 10(4) cps/(MBq ml(-1)). Dead time as a function of count-rate was found to be less than 1% for concentrations below 3.5 MBq ml(-1), a range encompassing all human-study values. In a human study, the performance of the device was found to be similar to that of the facility's current blood monitor (Siemens Fluid Monitor). We conclude that the Posi-RAM has the necessary sensitivity and count-rate capabilities to be used as a real-time blood activity monitor.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18184990/
"Meningiomas: a comparative study of 68Ga-DOTATOC, 68Ga-DOTANOC and 68Ga-DOTATATE for molecular imaging in mice","María Luisa Soto-Montenegro, Santiago Peña-Zalbidea, Jose María Mateos-Pérez, Marta Oteo, Eduardo Romero, Miguel Ángel Morcillo, Manuel Desco","Purpose: The goal of this study was to compare the tumor uptake kinetics and diagnostic value of three (68)Ga-DOTA-labeled somatostatin analogues ((68)Ga-DOTATOC, (68)Ga-DOTANOC, and (68)Ga-DOTATATE) using PET/CT in a murine model with subcutaneous meningioma xenografts.

Methods: The experiment was performed with 16 male NUDE NU/NU mice bearing xenografts of a human meningioma cell line (CH-157MN). (68)Ga-DOTATOC, (68)Ga-DOTANOC, and (68)Ga-DOTATATE were produced in a FASTLab automated platform. Imaging was performed on an Argus small-animal PET/CT scanner. The SUVmax of the liver and muscle, and the tumor-to-liver (T/L) and tumor-to-muscle (T/M) SUV ratios were computed. Kinetic analysis was performed using Logan graphical analysis for a two-tissue reversible compartmental model, and the volume of distribution (Vt) was determined.

Results: Hepatic SUVmax and Vt were significantly higher with (68)Ga-DOTANOC than with (68)Ga-DOTATOC and (68)Ga-DOTATATE. No significant differences between tracers were found for SUVmax in tumor or muscle. No differences were found in the T/L SUV ratio between (68)Ga-DOTATATE and (68)Ga-DOTATOC, both of which had a higher fraction than (68)Ga-DOTANOC. The T/M SUV ratio was significantly higher with (68)Ga-DOTATATE than with (68)Ga-DOTATOC and (68)Ga-DOTANOC. The Vt for tumor was higher with (68)Ga-DOTATATE than with (68)Ga-DOTANOC and relatively similar to that of (68)Ga-DOTATOC.

Conclusions: This study demonstrates, for the first time, the ability of the three radiolabeled somatostatin analogues tested to image a human meningioma cell line. Although Vt was relatively similar with (68)Ga-DOTATATE and (68)Ga-DOTATOC, uptake was higher with (68)Ga-DOTATATE in the tumor than with (68)Ga-DOTANOC and (68)Ga-DOTATOC, suggesting a higher diagnostic value of (68)Ga-DOTATATE for detecting meningiomas.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25369268/
Radiolabelling and evaluation of a novel sulfoxide as a PET imaging agent for tumor hypoxia,"Evelyn Laurens, Shinn Dee Yeoh, Angela Rigopoulos, Diana Cao, Glenn A Cartwright, Graeme J O'Keefe, Henri J Tochon-Danguy, Jonathan M White, Andrew M Scott, Uwe Ackermann","[¹⁸F]FMISO is the most widely validated PET radiotracer for imaging hypoxic tissue. However, as a result of the pharmacokinetics of [¹⁸F]FMISO a 2h wait between tracer administration and patient scanning is required for optimal image acquisition. In order to develop hypoxia imaging agents with faster kinetics, we have synthesised and evaluated several F-18 labelled anilino sulfoxides. In this manuscript we report on the synthesis, in vitro and in vivo evaluation of a novel fluoroethyltriazolyl propargyl anilino sulfoxide. The radiolabelling of the novel tracer was achieved via 2-[¹⁸F]fluoroethyl azide click chemistry. Radiochemical yields were 23 ± 4% based on 2-[¹⁸F]fluoroethyl azide and 7 ± 2% based on K[¹⁸F]F. The radiotracer did not undergo metabolism or defluorination in an in vitro assay using S9 liver fractions. Imaging studies using SK-RC-52 tumors in BALB/c nude mice have indicated that the tracer may have a higher pO₂ threshold than [¹⁸F]FMISO for uptake in hypoxic tumors. Although clearance from muscle was faster than [¹⁸F]FMISO, uptake in hypoxic tumors was slower. The average tumor to muscle ratio at 2h post injection in large, hypoxic tumors with a volume greater than 686 mm³ was 1.7, which was similar to the observed ratio of 1.75 for [¹⁸F]FMISO. Although the new tracer showed improved pharmacokinetics when compared with the previously synthesised sulfoxides, further modifications to the chemical structure need to be made in order to offer significant in vivo imaging advantages over [¹⁸F]FMISO.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24767600/
Metabolites of (18)F-FDG and 3-O-(11)C-methylglucose in pig liver,"D Bender, O L Munk, H Q Feng, S Keiding","PET uses (18)F-FDG widely to estimate glucose metabolism in vivo. Dynamic PET data are evaluated by kinetic models of the metabolic pathways. Knowledge of the metabolites of FDG is of critical importance for the interpretation of kinetic PET studies. The purpose of this study was to determine the metabolic pathways of FDG and 3-O-(11)C-methylglucose (MG) in liver tissue in vivo. It is usually assumed that MG is not metabolized and FDG is converted to (18)F-FDG-6-phosphate (FDG-6-P).

Methods: The study was performed on 6 anesthetized 40-kg pigs that were given the 2 tracers intravenously. The content of metabolites was determined in successive liver tissue biopsies. Freeze-clamped liver tissue samples were subjected to extraction by acetonitrile at -5 degrees C to -10 degrees C, and extracts were analyzed by radio-high-performance liquid chromatography (radio-HPLC). The findings were identified by means of radio-HLPC measurements of the products of in vitro enzymatic reactions.

Results: The applied extraction technique provided almost quantitative recovery of the radioactivity from tissue. After MG injection, only MG was detectable in the liver tissue; no labeled metabolites were found. After FDG injection, 2 metabolites were identified, FDG-6-P and 2-(18)F-fluoro-2-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate (FD-6-PG1). The tissue content of FDG increased rapidly, and, after 5 min, only FDG was identified; hereafter, the fraction of FDG decreased to approximately 40% of the tissue radioactivity after 180 min. After 20 min, FDG-6-P was found in each of the pigs and it increased throughout the measurement period of 180 min, with a somewhat slower rise at late time points. FD-6-PG1 began to appear in the liver tissue after 45 min and increased throughout the 180-min experiment, with the increase somewhat slower than that of FDG-6-P. After 180 min, approximately 40% of the metabolites was attributed to FD-6-PG1. The content of other metabolites was <2%, even after 180 min.

Conclusion: After the FDG injection, not only FDG-6-P but also FD-6-PG1 were formed in the liver. Any possible incorporation of FDG into glycogen was of minor importance.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11696638/

The goal of the present study was to evaluate the PDE2A ligand (18)F-PF-05270430, 4-(3-fluoroazetidin-1-yl)-7-methyl-5-(1-methyl-5-(4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)imidazo[1,5-f][1,2,4]triazine, in nonhuman primates.

Methods: (18)F-PF-05270430 was radiolabeled by 2 methods via nucleophilic substitution of its tosylate precursor. Tissue metabolite analysis in rodents and PET imaging in nonhuman primates under baseline and blocking conditions were performed to determine the pharmacokinetic and binding characteristics of the new radioligand. Various kinetic modeling approaches were assessed to select the optimal method for analysis of imaging data.

Results: (18)F-PF-05270430 was synthesized in greater than 98% radiochemical purity and high specific activity. In the nonhuman primate brain, uptake of (18)F-PF-05270430 was fast, with peak concentration (SUVs of 1.5-1.8 in rhesus monkeys) achieved within 7 min after injection. The rank order of uptake was striatum > neocortical regions > cerebellum. Regional time-activity curves were well fitted by the 2-tissue-compartment model and the multilinear analysis-1 (MA1) method to arrive at reliable estimates of regional distribution volume (VT) and binding potential (BPND) with 120 min of scan data. Regional VT values (MA1) ranged from 1.28 mL/cm(3) in the cerebellum to 3.71 mL/cm(3) in the putamen, with a BPND of 0.25 in the temporal cortex and 1.92 in the putamen. Regional BPND values estimated by the simplified reference tissue model (SRTM) were similar to those from MA1. Test-retest variability in high-binding regions (striatum) was 4% ± 6% for MA1 VT, 13% ± 6% for MA1 BPND, and 13% ± 7% SRTM BPND, respectively. Pretreatment of animals with the PDE2A inhibitor PF-05180999 resulted in a dose-dependent reduction of (18)F-PF-05270430 specific binding, with a half maximal effective concentration of 69.4 ng/mL in plasma PF-05180999 concentration.

Conclusion: (18)F-PF-05270430 displayed fast and reversible kinetics in nonhuman primates, as well as specific binding blockable by a PDE2A inhibitor. This is the first PET tracer with desirable imaging properties and demonstrated ability to image and quantify PDE2A in vivo.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27199356/

Previously, we reported on (rac)-18F-OF-NB1 as a promising GluN1/2B PET probe in rodents and its successful application for the visualization of GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors in postmortem brain tissues of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In the current work, we report on thein vivocharacterization of (rac)-, (R)-, and (S)-18F-OF-NB1 in nonhuman primates.Methods:PET scans were performed on rhesus monkeys. Plasma profiling was used to obtain the arterial input function. Regional brain time-activity curves were generated and fitted with the 1- and 2-tissue-compartment models and the multilinear analysis 1 method, and the corresponding regional volumes of distribution were calculated. Blocking studies with the GluN1/2B ligand Co 101244 (0.25 mg/kg) were performed for the enantiopure radiotracers. Receptor occupancy, nonspecific volume of distribution, and regional binding potential (BPND) were obtained. Potential off-target binding toward σ1receptors was assessed for (S)-18F-OF-NB1 using the σ1receptor ligand FTC-146.Results:Free plasma fraction was moderate, ranging from 12% to 16%. All radiotracers showed high and heterogeneous brain uptake, with the highest levels in the cortex. (R)-18F-OF-NB1 showed the highest uptake and slowest washout kinetics of all tracers. The 1-tissue-compartment model and multilinear analysis 1 method fitted the regional time-activity curves well for all tracers and produced reliable regional volumes of distribution, which were higher for (R)- than (S)-18F-OF-NB1. Receptor occupancy by Co 101244 was 85% and 96% for (S)-18F-OF-NB1 and (R)-18F-OF-NB1, respectively. Pretreatment with FTC-146 at both a low (0.027 mg/kg) and high (0.125 mg/kg) dose led to a similar reduction (48% and 49%, respectively) in specific binding of (S)-18F-OF-NB1. Further, pretreatment with both Co 101244 and FTC-146 did not result in a further reduction in specific binding compared with Co 101244 alone in the same monkey (82% vs. 81%, respectively). RegionalBPNDvalues ranged from 1.3 in the semiovale to 3.4 in the cingulate cortex for (S)-18F-OF-NB1.Conclusion:Both (R)- and (S)-18F-OF-NB1 exhibited high binding specificity to GluN2B subunit-containing NMDA receptors. The fast washout kinetics, good regionalBPNDvalues, and high plasma free fraction render (S)-18F-OF-NB1 an attractive radiotracer for clinical translation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35710735/
Elimination of tumor hypoxia by eribulin demonstrated by 18F-FMISO hypoxia imaging in human tumor xenograft models,"Songji Zhao, Wenwen Yu, Naoyuki Ukon, Chengbo Tan, Ken-Ichi Nishijima, Yoichi Shimizu, Kei Higashikawa, Tohru Shiga, Hiroko Yamashita, Nagara Tamaki, Yuji Kuge","Background: Eribulin, an inhibitor of microtubule dynamics, shows antitumor potency against a variety of solid cancers through its antivascular activity and remodeling of tumor vasculature.18F-Fluoromisonidazole (18F-FMISO) is the most widely used PET probe for imaging tumor hypoxia. In this study, we utilized18F-FMISO to clarify the effects of eribulin on the tumor hypoxic condition in comparison with histological findings.

Material and methods: Mice bearing a human cancer cell xenograft were intraperitoneally administered a single dose of eribulin (0.3 or 1.0 mg/kg) or saline. Three days after the treatment, mice were injected with18F-FMISO and pimonidazole (hypoxia marker for immunohistochemistry), and intertumoral18F-FMISO accumulation levels and histological characteristics were determined. PET/CT was performed pre- and post-treatment with eribulin (0.3 mg/kg, i.p.).

Results: The18F-FMISO accumulation levels and percent pimonidazole-positive hypoxic area were significantly lower, whereas the number of microvessels was higher in the tumors treated with eribulin. The PET/CT confirmed that18F-FMISO distribution in the tumor was decreased after the eribulin treatment.

Conclusions: Using18F-FMISO, we demonstrated the elimination of the tumor hypoxic condition by eribulin treatment, concomitantly with the increase in microvessel density. These findings indicate that PET imaging using18F-FMISO may provide the possibility to detect the early treatment response in clinical patients undergoing eribulin treatment.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31161539/
Carbon-11-acetate PET imaging in renal disease,"P Shreve, P C Chiao, H D Humes, M Schwaiger, M D Gross","The purpose of this study was to investigate the use of [1-11C]acetate as a metabolic tracer for renal imaging in human subjects.

Methods: Eighteen patients underwent dynamic PET imaging of the kidneys after intravenous bolus injection of 10-20 mCi [1-11C]acetate. Time-activity curves of renal parenchyma tracer activity were fitted to a two-compartment model using direct arterial blood sampling for the arterial input function.

Results: Renal uptake of [1-11C]acetate is prompt and high target-to-background ratios are achieved even in the presence of markedly reduced renal function. Carbon-11-acetate is cleared from the renal parenchyma without any urinary excretion and the rate of clearance is comparable to myocardial clearance rates. Among normal subjects, K1, ranged from 0.653 to 1.37 ml/min-g, and was reduced to as low as 0.363 ml/min-g in severe renal disease (serum creatinine greater than 5 mg/dl), while k2 ranged from 0.114 to 0.166 min-1 among normal subjects and was reduced to as low as 0.053 min-1 in severe renal disease. Kinetic parameters K1 and k2 were both reduced in the presence of intrinsic renal disease or significant renal artery stenosis. Renal cell carcinoma demonstrated similar uptake of [1-11C]acetate, but substantially reduced the rate of clearance compared to normal and diseased non-neoplastic renal tissue, allowing for ready differentiation of renal cell carcinoma from non-neoplastic renal tissue on images acquired beyond 10 min of tracer administration.

Conclusion: Carbon-11-acetate is a promising physiologic tracer for the study of renal disease.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7658216/
Blood flow and metabolism by PET,H R Schelbert,"Quantitative imaging capabilities, the large number of radiotracers labeled with short-lived positron-emitting isotopes, and appropriate tracer kinetic models offer a broad range of possibilities for probing different aspects of normal and diseased human myocardium. To some extent, PET has already had an impact on clinical cardiology and can decisively influence patient management. At the same time, PET offers tools for elucidating mechanisms of disease and for monitoring responses to treatment. It is also likely to offer new insights into myocardial function in normal and pathologic conditions. Although these insights may initially seem to lack clinical implications, they are likely to lead to a new hypothesis which can simultaneously be tested. The considerable range of assay techniques available with PET is likely to contribute to a more comprehensive characterization of abnormal processes. This, in turn, may lead to new therapeutic opportunities and, thus, result in a broader utilization of PET in cardiovascular disease.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8033179/
Deconvolution of Plasma Pharmacokinetics from Dynamic Heart Imaging Data Obtained by Single Positron Emission Computed Tomography/Computed Tomography Imaging,"Zengtao Wang, Lushan Wang, Malik Ebbini, Geoffry L Curran, Paul H Min, Ronald A Siegel, Val J Lowe, Karunya K Kandimalla","Plasma pharmacokinetic (PK) data are required as an input function for graphical analysis of single positron emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) and positron emission tomography/CT (PET/CT) data to evaluate tissue influx rate of radiotracers. Dynamic heart imaging data are often used as a surrogate of plasma PK. However, accumulation of radiolabel in the heart tissue may cause overprediction of plasma PK. Therefore, we developed a compartmental model, which involves forcing functions to describe intact and degraded radiolabeled proteins in plasma and their accumulation in heart tissue, to deconvolve plasma PK of125I-amyloid beta 40 (125I-Aβ40) and125I-insulin from their dynamic heart imaging data. The three-compartment model was shown to adequately describe the plasma concentration-time profile of intact/degraded proteins and the heart radioactivity time data obtained from SPECT/CT imaging for both tracers. The model was successfully applied to deconvolve the plasma PK of both tracers from their naïve datasets of dynamic heart imaging. In agreement with our previous observations made by conventional serial plasma sampling, the deconvolved plasma PK of125I-Aβ40and125I-insulin in young mice exhibited lower area under the curve than aged mice. Further, Patlak plot parameters extracted using deconvolved plasma PK as input function successfully recapitulated age-dependent plasma-to-brain influx kinetics changes. Therefore, the compartment model developed in this study provides a novel approach to deconvolve plasma PK of radiotracers from their noninvasive dynamic heart imaging. This method facilitates the application of preclinical SPECT/PET imaging data to characterize distribution kinetics of tracers where simultaneous plasma sampling is not feasible. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Knowledge of plasma pharmacokinetics (PK) of a radiotracer is necessary to accurately estimate its plasma-to-brain influx. However, simultaneous plasma sampling during dynamic imaging procedures is not always feasible. In the current study, we developed approaches to deconvolve plasma PK from dynamic heart imaging data of two model radiotracers,125I-amyloid beta 40 (125I-Aβ40) and125I-insulin. This novel method is expected to minimize the need for conducting additional plasma PK studies and allow for accurate estimation of the brain influx rate.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37221092/
Cardiac PET imaging for the detection and monitoring of coronary artery disease and microvascular health,"Thomas H Schindler, Heinrich R Schelbert, Alessandra Quercioli, Vasken Dilsizian","Positron emission tomography (PET) myocardial perfusion imaging in concert with tracer-kinetic modeling affords the assessment of regional myocardial blood flow (MBF) of the left ventricle in absolute terms (milliliters per gram per minute). Assessment of MBF both at rest and during various forms of vasomotor stress provides insight into early and subclinical abnormalities in coronary arterial vascular function and/or structure, noninvasively. The noninvasive evaluation and quantification of MBF and myocardial flow reserve (MFR) extend the scope of conventional myocardial perfusion imaging from detection of end-stage, advanced, and flow-limiting, epicardial coronary artery disease (CAD) to early stages of atherosclerosis or microvascular dysfunction. Recent studies have shown that impaired hyperemic MBF or MFR with PET, with or without accompanying CAD, is predictive of increased relative risk of death or progression of heart failure. Quantitative approaches that measure MBF with PET identify multivessel CAD and offer the opportunity to monitor responses to lifestyle and/or risk factor modification and to therapeutic interventions. Whether improvement or normalization of hyperemic MBF and/or the MFR will translate to improvement in long-term cardiovascular outcome remains clinically untested. In the meantime, absolute measures of MBF with PET can be used as a surrogate marker for coronary vascular health, and to monitor therapeutic interventions. Although the assessment of myocardial perfusion with PET has become an indispensable tool in cardiac research, it remains underutilized in clinical practice. Individualized, image-guided cardiovascular therapy may likely change this paradigm in the near future.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20541718/
Analysis and interpretation of dynamic FDG PET oncological studies using data reduction techniques,"Sotiris Pavlopoulos, Trias Thireou, George Kontaxakis, Andres Santos","Background: Dynamic positron emission tomography studies produce a large amount of image data, from which clinically useful parametric information can be extracted using tracer kinetic methods. Data reduction methods can facilitate the initial interpretation and visual analysis of these large image sequences and at the same time can preserve important information and allow for basic feature characterization.

Methods: We have applied principal component analysis to provide high-contrast parametric image sets of lower dimensions than the original data set separating structures based on their kinetic characteristics. Our method has the potential to constitute an alternative quantification method, independent of any kinetic model, and is particularly useful when the retrieval of the arterial input function is complicated. In independent component analysis images, structures that have different kinetic characteristics are assigned opposite values, and are readily discriminated. Furthermore, novel similarity mapping techniques are proposed, which can summarize in a single image the temporal properties of the entire image sequence according to a reference region.

Results: Using our new cubed sum coefficient similarity measure, we have shown that structures with similar time activity curves can be identified, thus facilitating the detection of lesions that are not easily discriminated using the conventional method employing standardized uptake values.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17915012/
Comparison of three-parameter kinetic model analysis to standard Patlak's analysis in 18F-FDG PET imaging of lung cancer patients,"E Laffon, M L Calcagni, G Galli, A Giordano, A Capotosti, R Marthan, L Indovina","Background: Patlak's graphical analysis can provide tracer net influx constant (Ki) with limitation of assuming irreversible tracer trapping, that is, release rate constant (kb) set to zero. We compared linear Patlak's analysis to non-linear three-compartment three-parameter kinetic model analysis (3P-KMA) providing Ki, kb, and fraction of free18F-FDG in blood and interstitial volume (Vb).

Methods: Dynamic PET data of 21 lung cancer patients were retrospectively analyzed, yielding for each patient an18F-FDG input function (IF) and a tissue time-activity curve. The former was fitted with a three-exponentially decreasing function, and the latter was fitted with an analytical formula involving the fitted IF data (11 data points, ranging 7.5-57.5 min post-injection). Bland-Altman analysis was used for Ki comparison between Patlak's analysis and 3P-KMA. Additionally, a three-compartment five-parameter KMA (5P-KMA) was implemented for comparison with Patlak's analysis and 3P-KMA.

Results: We found that 3P-KMA Ki was significantly greater than Patlak's Ki over the whole patient series, + 6.0% on average, with limits of agreement of ± 17.1% (95% confidence). Excluding 8 out of 21 patients with kb> 0 deleted this difference. A strong correlation was found between Ki ratio (=3P-KMA/Patlak) and kb(R = 0.801; P < 0.001). No significant difference in Ki was found between 3P-KMA versus 5P-KMA, and between 5P-KMA versus Patlak's analysis, with limits of agreement of ± 23.0 and ± 31.7% (95% confidence), respectively.

Conclusions: Comparison between 3P-KMA and Patlak's analysis significantly showed that the latter underestimates Ki because it arbitrarily set kbto zero: the greater the kbvalue, the greater the Ki underestimation. This underestimation was not revealed when comparing 5P-KMA and Patlak's analysis. We suggest that further studies are warranted to investigate the 3P-KMA efficiency in various tissues showing greater18F-FDG trapping reversibility than lung cancer lesions.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29589224/
PET measurement of cerebral acetylcholine esterase activity without blood sampling,"K Herholz, M Lercher, K Wienhard, B Bauer, O Lenz, W D Heiss","Measurement of cerebral acetylcholine esterase (AChE) activity is of clinical interest for the differential diagnosis of memory disorders and dementia. We developed and tested a non-invasive method for quantitation of regional cortical AChE activity with carbon-11-labelled N-methyl-4-piperidyl acetate (11C-MP4A) that does not require arterial blood sampling. AChE activity was measured in terms of the rate constant for hydrolysis of 11C-MP4A (k3). The physiological model is based on the very high AChE activity in the basal ganglia, which are used as a reference structure. Non-invasive k3 was compared with k3 determined with a standard technique by fitting kinetic tissue and metabolite-corrected plasma data in nine subjects with and without dementia. Across all regional values, a very high correlation of 0.92 was found, with a tendency towards moderate underestimation of k3 by 5%-14% with the non-invasive technique as compared to the invasive technique. In addition to its advantages with respect to practicability, the new non-invasive technique overcomes problems of the invasive technique that are related to interindividual variation of delay times between cerebral and peripheral tracer arrival and measurement of very small amounts of non-hydrolysed tracer in plasma samples.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11357497/

Dynamic 90-min scans were obtained after bolus injection of11C-RO-963,11C-RO-643, or18F-RO-948. Arterial blood sampling was performed on 11 healthy controls and 11 AD subjects. Regions were defined on MR images, and PET data were quantified by plasma reference graphical analysis (for total distribution volume) and target cerebellum ratio (SUV ratios of 60- to 90-min frames). SUV ratio images were also analyzed voxelwise. Five older controls each underwent 2 scans with18F-RO-948 for evaluation of test-retest variability. Four AD subjects underwent a repeated18F-RO-948 scan 6-22 mo after the first scan. Six additional healthy controls (3 men and 3 women; age range, 41-67 y) each underwent 1 whole-body dosimetry scan with18F-RO-948.Results:In younger controls, SUVpeakwas observed in the temporal lobe with values of approximately 3.0 for11C-RO-963, 1.5 for11C-RO-643, and 3.5 for18F-RO-948. Over all brain regions and subjects, the trend was for18F-RO-948 to have the highest SUVpeak, followed by11C-RO-963 and then11C-RO-643. Regional analysis of SUV ratio and total distribution volume for11C-RO-643 and18F-RO-948 clearly discriminated the AD group from the healthy control groups. Compartmental modeling confirmed that11C-RO-643 had lower brain entry than either11C-RO-963 or18F-RO-948 and that18F-RO-948 showed better contrast between (predicted) areas of high versus low tau accumulation. Thus, our subsequent analysis focused on18F-RO-948. Both voxelwise and region-based analysis of18F-RO-948 binding in healthy controls versus AD subjects revealed multiple areas where AD subjects significantly differed from healthy controls. Of 22 high-binding regions, 13 showed a significant group difference (after ANOVA,F(1,21)= 45,P< 10-5). Voxelwise analysis also revealed a set of symmetric clusters where AD subjects had higher binding than healthy controls (threshold ofP< 0.001, cluster size > 50).Conclusion:18F-RO-948 demonstrates characteristics superior to11C-RO-643 and11C-RO-963 for characterization of tau pathology in AD. Regional binding data and kinetic properties of18F-RO-948 compare favorably with other existing tau PET tracers.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29728519/
Total-Body PET/CT Applications in Cardiovascular Diseases: A Perspective Document of the SNMMI Cardiovascular Council,"Riemer H J A Slart, Frank M Bengel, Cigdem Akincioglu, Jamieson M Bourque, Wengen Chen, Marc R Dweck, Marcus Hacker, Saurabh Malhotra, Edward J Miller, Matthieu Pelletier-Galarneau, René R S Packard, Thomas H Schindler, Richard L Weinberg, Antti Saraste, Piotr J Slomka","Digital PET/CT systems with a long axial field of view have become available and are emerging as the current state of the art. These new camera systems provide wider anatomic coverage, leading to major increases in system sensitivity. Preliminary results have demonstrated improvements in image quality and quantification, as well as substantial advantages in tracer kinetic modeling from dynamic imaging. These systems also potentially allow for low-dose examinations and major reductions in acquisition time. Thereby, they hold great promise to improve PET-based interrogation of cardiac physiology and biology. Additionally, the whole-body coverage enables simultaneous assessment of multiple organs and the large vascular structures of the body, opening new opportunities for imaging systemic mechanisms, disorders, or treatments and their interactions with the cardiovascular system as a whole. The aim of this perspective document is to debate the potential applications, challenges, opportunities, and remaining challenges of applying PET/CT with a long axial field of view to the field of cardiovascular disease.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38388512/
Variability of dynamic 18F-FDG-PET data in breast cancer xenografts,"Kathinka E Pitman, Espen Rusten, Alexandr Kristian, Eirik Malinen","Background: A murine breast cancer xenograft model was employed to evaluate inter- and intra-variability of various parameters derived from dynamic positron emission tomography with [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose as tracer (FDG-PET).

Material and methods: Seventeen female athymic nude foxn1/nu mice with bilaterally implanted triple-negative basal-like ductal carcinoma (MAS98.12) breast cancer xenografts underwent a dynamic PET scan over an hour after injection of approximately 10 MBq FDG. Inter-animal data were obtained from the entire animal cohort, while intra-animal data were from four mice receiving an additional scan after one or two days. Standardised uptake values (SUVmax, SUVmean and SUVmedian) were estimated for all tumours at different time points. Tumour uptake was analysed with a kinetic two-compartment model for estimation of pharmacokinetic parameters. The coefficient of variation (CV) was calculated for all PET-derived metrics.

Results: The CVs for SUVmean and SUVmedian were typically 10-20% for the tumours, depending on the time post-injection and group (intra vs. inter). The CV for SUVmax was mostly higher. The variability in the pharmacokinetic parameters ranged from 23 to almost 150%.

Conclusions: SUVmean and SUVmedian show less variability than SUVmax. The pharmacokinetic tumour metrics again display much greater variability than the SUV-based metrics. However, it is generally not known which of these metrics that best represents cancer aggressiveness and their use may still depend on the research questions addressed.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26217987/
Quantitative assessment of myelin density using [11C]MeDAS PET in patients with multiple sclerosis: a first-in-human study,"Chris W J van der Weijden, Jan F Meilof, Anouk van der Hoorn, Junqing Zhu, Chunying Wu, Yanming Wang, Antoon T M Willemsen, Rudi A J O Dierckx, Adriaan A Lammertsma, Erik F J de Vries","Purpose: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease characterized by inflammatory demyelinated lesions. New treatment strategies are being developed to stimulate myelin repair. Quantitative myelin imaging could facilitate these developments. This first-in-man study aimed to evaluate [11C]MeDAS as a PET tracer for myelin imaging in humans.

Methods: Six healthy controls and 11 MS patients underwent MRI and dynamic [11C]MeDAS PET scanning with arterial sampling. Lesion detection and classification were performed on MRI. [11C]MeDAS time-activity curves of brain regions and MS lesions were fitted with various compartment models for the identification of the best model to describe [11C]MeDAS kinetics. Several simplified methods were compared to the optimal compartment model.

Results: Visual analysis of the fits of [11C]MeDAS time-activity curves showed no preference for irreversible (2T3k) or reversible (2T4k) two-tissue compartment model. Both volume of distribution and binding potential estimates showed a high degree of variability. As this was not the case for 2T3k-derived net influx rate (Ki), the 2T3k model was selected as the model of choice. Simplified methods, such as SUV and MLAIR2 correlated well with 2T3k-derived Ki, but SUV showed subject-dependent bias when compared to 2T3k. Both the 2T3k model and the simplified methods were able to differentiate not only between gray and white matter, but also between lesions with different myelin densities.

Conclusion: [11C]MeDAS PET can be used for quantification of myelin density in MS patients and is able to distinguish differences in myelin density within MS lesions. The 2T3k model is the optimal compartment model and MLAIR2 is the best simplified method for quantification.

Type 2 diabetes enhances arterial uptake of choline in atherosclerotic mice: an imaging study with positron emission tomography tracer ¹⁸F-fluoromethylcholine,"Sanna Hellberg, Johanna M U Silvola, Max Kiugel, Heidi Liljenbäck, Olli Metsälä, Tapio Viljanen, Jari Metso, Matti Jauhiainen, Pekka Saukko, Pirjo Nuutila, Seppo Ylä-Herttuala, Juhani Knuuti, Anne Roivainen, Antti Saraste","Background: Diabetes is a risk factor for atherosclerosis associated with oxidative stress, inflammation and cell proliferation. The purpose of this study was to evaluate arterial choline uptake and its relationship to atherosclerotic inflammation in diabetic and non-diabetic hypercholesterolemic mice.

Methods: Low-density lipoprotein-receptor deficient mice expressing only apolipoprotein B100, with or without type 2 diabetes caused by pancreatic overexpression of insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II/LDLR(-/-)ApoB(100/100) and LDLR(-/-)ApoB(100/100)) were studied. Distribution kinetics of choline analogue (18)F-fluoromethylcholine ((18)F-FMCH) was assessed in vivo by positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. Then, aortic uptakes of (18)F-FMCH and glucose analogue (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG), were assessed ex vivo by gamma counting and autoradiography of tissue sections. The (18)F-FMCH uptake in atherosclerotic plaques was further compared with macrophage infiltration and the plasma levels of cytokines and metabolic markers.

Results: The aortas of all hypercholesterolemic mice showed large, macrophage-rich atherosclerotic plaques. The plaque burden and densities of macrophage subtypes were similar in diabetic and non-diabetic animals. The blood clearance of (18)F-FMCH was rapid. Both the absolute (18)F-FMCH uptake in the aorta and the aorta-to-blood uptake ratio were higher in diabetic than in non-diabetic mice. In autoradiography, the highest (18)F-FMCH uptake co-localized with macrophage-rich atherosclerotic plaques. (18)F-FMCH uptake in plaques correlated with levels of total cholesterol, insulin, C-peptide and leptin. In comparison with (18)F-FDG, (18)F-FMCH provided similar or higher plaque-to-background ratios in diabetic mice.

Conclusions: Type 2 diabetes enhances the uptake of choline that reflects inflammation in atherosclerotic plaques in mice. PET tracer (18)F-FMCH is a potential tool to study vascular inflammation associated with diabetes.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26852231/
Imaging of VEGF receptor in a rat myocardial infarction model using PET,"Martin Rodriguez-Porcel, Weibo Cai, Olivier Gheysens, Jürgen K Willmann, Kai Chen, Hui Wang, Ian Y Chen, Lina He, Joseph C Wu, Zi-bo Li, Khalid A Mohamedali, Sehoon Kim, Michael G Rosenblum, Xiaoyuan Chen, Sanjiv Sam Gambhir","Myocardial infarction (MI) leads to left ventricular (LV) remodeling, which leads to the activation of growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). However, the kinetics of a growth factor's receptor expression, such as VEGF, in the living subject has not yet been described. We have developed a PET tracer (64Cu-DOTA-VEGF121 [DOTA is 1,4,7,10-tetraazadodecane-N,N',N'',N'''-tetraacetic acid]) to image VEGF receptor (VEGFR) expression after MI in the living subject.

Methods: In Sprague-Dawley rats, MI was induced by ligation of the left coronary artery and confirmed by ultrasound (n = 8). To image and study the kinetics of VEGFRs, 64Cu-DOTA-VEGF121 PET scans were performed before MI induction (baseline) and on days 3, 10, 17, and 24 after MI. Sham-operated animals served as controls (n = 3).

Results: Myocardial origin of the 64Cu-DOTA-VEGF121 signal was confirmed by CT coregistration and autoradiography. VEGFR specificity of the 64Cu-DOTA-VEGF121 probe was confirmed by in vivo use of a 64Cu-DOTA-VEGFmutant. Baseline myocardial uptake of 64Cu-DOTA-VEGF121 was minimal (0.30 +/- 0.07 %ID/g [percentage injected dose per gram of tissue]); it increased significantly after MI (day 3, 0.97 +/- 0.05 %ID/g; P < 0.05 vs. baseline) and remained elevated for 2 wk (up to day 17 after MI), after which time it returned to baseline levels.

Conclusion: We demonstrate the feasibility of imaging VEGFRs in the myocardium. In summary, we imaged and described the kinetics of 64Cu-DOTA-VEGF121 uptake in a rat model of MI. Studies such as the one presented here will likely play a major role when studying pathophysiology and assessing therapies in different animal models of disease and, potentially, in patients.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18375924/
PACE4-based molecular targeting of prostate cancer using an engineered ⁶⁴Cu-radiolabeled peptide inhibitor,"Frédéric Couture, Christine Levesque, Véronique Dumulon-Perreault, Samia Ait-Mohand, François D'Anjou, Robert Day, Brigitte Guérin","The potential of PACE4 as a pharmacological target in prostate cancer has been demonstrated as this proprotein convertase is strongly overexpressed in human prostate cancer tissues and its inhibition, using molecular or pharmacological approaches, results in reduced cell proliferation and tumor progression in mouse tumor xenograft models. We developed a PACE4 high-affinity peptide inhibitor, namely, the multi-leucine (ML), and sought to determine whether this peptide could be exploited for the targeting of prostate cancer for diagnostic or molecular imaging purposes. We conjugated a bifunctional chelator 1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1,4,7- triacetic acid (NOTA) to the ML peptide for copper-64 ((64)Cu) labeling and positron emission tomography (PET)- based prostate cancer detection. Enzyme kinetic assays against recombinant PACE4 showed that the NOTA-modified ML peptide displays identical inhibitory properties compared to the unmodified peptide. In vivo biodistribution of the (64)Cu/NOTA-ML peptide evaluated in athymic nude mice bearing xenografts of two human prostate carcinoma cell lines showed a rapid and high uptake in PACE4-expressing LNCaP tumor at an early time point and in PACE4-rich organs. Co-injection of unlabeled peptide confirmed that tumor uptake was target-specific. PACE4-negative tumors displayed no tracer uptake 15 minutes after injection, while the kidneys, demonstrated high uptake due to rapid renal clearance of the peptide. The present study supports the feasibility of using a (64)Cu/NOTA-ML peptide for PACE4-targeted prostate cancer detection and PACE4 status determination by PET imaging but also provides evidence that ML inhibitor-based drugs would readily reach tumor sites under in vivo conditions for pharmacological intervention or targeted radiation therapy.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25220591/
Evaluating infusion methods and simplified quantification of synaptic density in vivo with [11C]UCB-J and [18F]SynVesT-1 PET,"Ruth H Asch, Mika Naganawa, Nabeel Nabulsi, Yiyun Huan, Irina Esterlis, Richard E Carson","For some positron emission tomography studies, radiotracer is administered as bolus plus continuous infusion (B/I) to achieve a state of equilibrium. This approach can reduce scanning time and simplify data analysis; however, the method must be validated and optimized for each tracer. This study aimed to validate a B/I method forin vivoquantification of synaptic density using radiotracers which target the synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2 A: [11C]UCB-J and [18F]SynVesT-1. Observed mean standardized uptake values (SUV) in target tissue relative to that in plasma (CT/CP) or a reference tissue (SUVR-1) were calculated for 30-minute intervals across 120 or 150-minute dynamic scans and compared against one-tissue compartment (1TC) model estimates of volume of distribution (VT) and binding potential (BPND), respectively. We were unable to reliably achieve a state of equilibrium with [11C]UCB-J, and all 30-minute windows yielded overly large bias and/or variability forCT/CPand SUVR-1. With [18F]SynVesT-1, a 30-minute scan 90-120 minutes post-injection yieldedCT/CPand SUVR-1 values that estimated their respective kinetic parameter with sufficient accuracy and precision (within 7±6%) . This B/I approach allows a clinically feasible scan at equilibrium with potentially better accuracy than a static scan SUVR following a bolus injection.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37669455/

In this study, several parametric images and tumour-to-normal maps were compared in terms of accuracy of region averages (when compared to results from nonlinear regression of a reversible two-tissue compartment plasma input model) and image noise using 90 min of dynamic scan data acquired in seven patients with diffuse glioma. We included plasma input methods (the basis function implementation of the single-tissue compartment model, spectral analysis and Logan graphical analysis) and reference tissue methods (basis function implementations of the simplified reference tissue model, variations of the multilinear reference tissue model and non-invasive Logan graphical analysis) as well as tumour-to-normal ratio maps at three intervals. (Non-invasive) Logan graphical analysis provided volume of distribution maps and distribution volume ratio maps with the lowest level of noise, while the basis function implementations provided the best accuracy. Tumour-to-normal ratio maps provided better results if later interval times were used, i.e. 60-90 min instead of 20-40 min, leading to lower bias (2.9% vs. 10.8%, respectively) and less noise (12.8% vs. 14.4%).",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31122112/
18F-labeled galacto and PEGylated RGD dimers for PET imaging of αvβ3 integrin expression,"Shuanglong Liu, Zhaofei Liu, Kai Chen, Yongjun Yan, Petra Watzlowik, Hans-Jürgen Wester, Frederick T Chin, Xiaoyuan Chen","Purpose: In vivo imaging of α(v)β(3) has important diagnostic and therapeutic applications. (18)F-Galacto-arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) has been developed for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of integrin α(v)β(3) expression and is now being tested on humans. Dimerization and multimerization of cyclic RGD peptides have been reported to improve the integrin α(v)β(3)-binding affinity due to the polyvalency effect. Here, we compared a number of new dimeric RGD peptide tracers with the clinically used (18)F-galacto-RGD.

Procedures: RGD monomers and dimers were coupled with galacto or PEG(3) linkers, and labeled with (18)F using 4-nitrophenyl 2-(18)F-fluoropropionate ((18)F-NFP) or N-succinimidyl 4-(18)F-fluorobenzoate as a prosthetic group. The newly developed tracers were evaluated by cell-based receptor-binding assay, biodistribution, and small-animal PET studies in a subcutaneous U87MG glioblastoma xenograft model.

Results: Starting with (18)F-F(-), the total reaction time for (18)F-FP-SRGD2 and (18)F-FP-PRGD2 is about 120 min. The decay-corrected radiochemical yields for (18)F-FP-SRGD2 and (18)F-FP-PRGD2 are 52 ± 9% and 80 ± 7% calculated from (18)F-NFP. Noninvasive small-animal PET and direct tissue sampling experiments demonstrated that the dimeric RGD peptides had significantly higher tumor uptake as compared to (18)F-galacto-RGD.

Conclusion: Dimeric RGD peptide tracers with relatively high tumor integrin-specific accumulation and favorable in vivo kinetics may have the potential to be translated into clinic for integrin α(v)β(3) imaging.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19949981/
"N-(4-[18F]fluorobenzyl)cholylglycine, a potential tracer for positron emission tomography of enterohepatic circulation and drug-induced inhibition of ileal bile acid transport. A proof-of-concept PET/CT study in pigs","Kim Frisch, Frank Viborg Mortensen, Ole Lajord Munk, Lars Christian Gormsen, Aage Kristian Olsen Alstrup","Introduction: Enterohepatic circulation (EHC) of conjugated bile acids is an important physiological process crucial for bile acids to function as detergents and signal carriers. Perturbation of the EHC by disease or drugs may lead to serious and life-threatening liver and gastrointestinal disorders. In this proof-of-concept study in pigs, we investigate the potential of N-(4-[18F]fluorobenzyl)cholylglycine ([18F]FBCGly) as tracer for quantitative positron emission tomography (PET) of the EHC of conjugated bile acids.

Methods: The biodistribution of [18F]FBCGly was investigated by PET/CT in domestic pigs following intravenous and intraileal administration of the tracer. Hepatic kinetics were estimated from PET and blood data using a 2-tissue compartmental model and dual-input of [18F]FBCGly. The ileal uptake of [18F]FBCGly was investigated with co-injection of nifedipine and endogenous cholyltaurine. Dosimetry was estimated from the PET data using the Olinda 2.0 software. Blood, bile and urine samples were analyzed for possible fluorine-18 labelled metabolites of [18F]FBCGly.

Results: [18F]FBCGly was rapidly taken up by the liver and excreted into bile, and underwent EHC without being metabolized. Both nifedipine and endogenous cholyltaurine inhibited the ileal uptake of [18F]FBCGly. The flow-dependent hepatic uptake clearance was estimated to median 1.2 mL blood/min/mL liver tissue. The mean residence time of [18F]FBCGly in hepatocytes was 4.0 ± 1.1 min. Critical organs for [18F]FBCGly were the gallbladder wall (0.94 mGy/MBq) and the small intestine (0.50 mGy/MBq). The effective dose for [18F]FBCGly was 36 μSv/MBq.

Conclusion: We have shown that [18F]FBCGly undergoes EHC in pigs without being metabolized and that its ileal uptake is inhibited by nifedipine and endogenous bile acids. Combined with our previous findings in rats, we believe that [18F]FBCGly has potential as PET tracer for assessment of EHC of conjugated bile acids under physiological conditions as well as conditions with perturbed hepatic and ileal bile acid transport.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36095922/
Pegylated Arg-Gly-Asp peptide: 64Cu labeling and PET imaging of brain tumor alphavbeta3-integrin expression,"Xiaoyuan Chen, Yingping Hou, Michel Tohme, Ryan Park, Vazgen Khankaldyyan, Ignacio Gonzales-Gomez, James R Bading, Walter E Laug, Peter S Conti","The alphav-integrins, cell adhesion molecules that are highly expressed on activated endothelial cells and tumor cells but not on dormant endothelial cells or normal cells, present an attractive target for tumor imaging and therapy. We previously coupled a cyclic Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) peptide, c(RGDyK), with 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-N,N',N'',N'''-tetraacetic acid (DOTA) and labeled the RGD-DOTA conjugate with 64Cu (half-life, 12.8 h; 19% beta+) for solid tumor targeting, with high tumor-to-background contrast. The rapid tumor washout rate and persistent liver and kidney retention of this tracer prompted us to optimize the tracer for improved pharmacokinetic behavior. In this study, we introduced a polyethylene glycol (PEG; molecular weight, 3,400) moiety between DOTA and RGD and evaluated the 64Cu-DOTA-PEG-RGD tracer for microPET imaging in brain tumor models.

Methods: DOTA was activated in situ and conjugated with RGD-PEG-NH2 under slightly basic conditions. alphavbeta3-Integrin-binding affinity was evaluated with a solid-phase receptor-binding assay in the presence of 125I-echistatin. Female nude mice bearing subcutaneous U87MG glioblastoma xenografts were administered 64Cu-DOTA-PEG-RGD, and the biodistributions of the radiotracer were evaluated from 30 min to 4 h after injection. microPET (20 min of static imaging at 1 h after injection) and then quantitative autoradiography were used for tumor visualization and quantification. The same tracer was also applied to an orthotopic U87MG model for tumor detection.

Results: The radiotracer was synthesized with a high specific activity (14,800-29,600 GBq/mmol [400-800 Ci/mmol]). The c(RGDyK)-PEG-DOTA ligand showed intermediate binding affinity for alphavbeta3-integrin (50% inhibitory concentration, 67.5 +/- 7.8 nmol/L [mean +/- SD]). The pegylated RGD peptide demonstrated rapid blood clearance (0.57 +/- 0.15 percentage injected dose [%ID]/g [mean +/- SD] at 30 min after injection and 0.03 +/- 0.02 %ID/g at 4 h after injection). Activity accumulation in the tumor was rapid and high at early time points (2.74 +/- 0.45 %ID/g at 30 min after injection), and some activity washout was seen over time (1.62 +/- 0.18 %ID/g at 4 h after injection). Compared with (64)Cu-DOTA-RGD, this tracer showed improved in vivo kinetics, with significantly reduced liver uptake (0.99 +/- 0.08 %ID/g vs. 1.73 +/- 0.39 %ID/g at 30 min after injection and 0.58 +/- 0.07 %ID/g vs. 2.57 +/- 0.49 %ID/g at 4 h after injection). The pegylated RGD peptide showed higher renal accumulation at early time points (3.51 +/- 0.24 %ID/g vs. 2.18 +/- 0.23 %ID/g at 30 min after infection) but more rapid clearance (1.82 +/- 0.29 %ID/g vs. 2.01 +/- 0.25 %ID/g at 1 h after injection) than 64Cu-DOTA-RGD. The integrin receptor specificity of this radiotracer was demonstrated by blocking of tumor uptake by coinjection with nonradiolabeled c(RGDyK). The high tumor-to-organ ratios for the pegylated RGD peptide tracer (at 1 h after injection: tumor-to-blood ratio, 20; tumor-to-muscle ratio, 12; tumor-to-liver ratio, 2.7; and tumor-to-kidney ratio, 1.2) were confirmed by microPET and autoradiographic imaging in a subcutaneous U87MG tumor model. This tracer was also able to detect an orthotopic brain tumor in a model in which U87MG cells were implanted into the mouse forebrain. Although the magnitude of tumor uptake in the orthotopic xenograft was lower than that in the subcutaneous xenograft, the orthotopic tumor was still visualized with clear contrast from normal brain tissue.

Conclusion: This study demonstrated the suitability of a PEG moiety for improving the in vivo kinetics of a 64Cu-RGD peptide tracer without compromising the tumor-targeting ability and specificity of the peptide. Systematic investigations of the effects of the size and geometry of PEG on tumor targeting and in vivo kinetics will lead to the development of radiotracers suitable for clinical applications such as visualizing and quantifying alphav-integrin expression by PET. In addition, the same ligand labeled with therapeutic radionuclides may be applicable for integrin-targeted internal radiotherapy.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15471848/

The synthesis is short and inexpensive. Ga(III) and Fe(III) complexes of PrP9 were characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Stepwise protonation constants and thermodynamic stabilities of metal complexes were determined by potentiometry. The Ga(III) complex possesses a high thermodynamic stability (log K([GaL])=26.24) and a high degree of kinetic inertness. (68)Ga labeling of PrP9 is possible at ambient temperature and in a wide pH range, also at pH values as low as 1. This means that for the first time, the neat eluate of a TiO(2)-based (68)Ge/(68)Ga generator (typically consisting of 0.1 M HCl) can be directly used for labeling purposes. The rate of (68)Ga activity incorporation at pH 3.3 and 20 degrees C is higher than for the established chelators DOTA and NOTA. Tris-amides of PrP9 with amino acid esters were synthesized to act as models for multimeric peptide conjugates.

In vivo imaging of endogenous pancreatic β-cell mass in healthy and type 1 diabetic subjects using 18F-fluoropropyl-dihydrotetrabenazine and PET,"Marc D Normandin, Kitt F Petersen, Yu-Shin Ding, Shu-Fei Lin, Sarita Naik, Krista Fowles, Daniel M Skovronsky, Kevan C Herold, Timothy J McCarthy, Roberto A Calle, Richard E Carson, Judith L Treadway, Gary W Cline","The ability to noninvasively measure endogenous pancreatic β-cell mass (BCM) would accelerate research on the pathophysiology of diabetes and revolutionize the preclinical development of new treatments, the clinical assessment of therapeutic efficacy, and the early diagnosis and subsequent monitoring of disease progression. The vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 (VMAT2) is coexpressed with insulin in β-cells and represents a promising target for BCM imaging.

Methods: We evaluated the VMAT2 radiotracer (18)F-fluoropropyl-dihydrotetrabenazine ((18)F-FP-(+)-DTBZ, also known as (18)F-AV-133) for quantitative PET of BCM in healthy control subjects and patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Standardized uptake value was calculated as the net tracer uptake in the pancreas normalized by injected dose and body weight. Total volume of distribution, the equilibrium ratio of tracer concentration in tissue relative to plasma, was estimated by kinetic modeling with arterial input functions. Binding potential, the steady-state ratio of specific binding to nondisplaceable uptake, was calculated using the renal cortex as a reference tissue devoid of specific VMAT2 binding.

Results: Mean pancreatic standardized uptake value, total volume of distribution, and binding potential were reduced by 38%, 20%, and 40%, respectively, in type 1 diabetes mellitus. The radiotracer binding parameters correlated with insulin secretion capacity as determined by arginine-stimulus tests. Group differences and correlations with β-cell function were enhanced for total pancreas binding parameters that accounted for tracer binding density and organ volume.

Mapping α2 adrenoceptors of the human brain with 11C-yohimbine,"Adjmal Nahimi, Steen Jakobsen, Ole L Munk, Kim Vang, Jenny A Phan, Anders Rodell, Albert Gjedde","A previous study from this laboratory suggested that (11)C-yohimbine, a selective α2-adrenoceptor antagonist, is an appropriate ligand for PET of α2 adrenoceptors that passes readily from blood to brain tissue in pigs but not in rodents. To test usefulness in humans, we determined blood-brain clearances, volumes of distribution, and receptor availability by means of PET with (11)C-yohimbine in healthy male adults.

Methods: We recorded the distribution of (11)C-yohimbine with 90-min dynamic PET and sampled arterial blood to measure intact (11)C-yohimbine in plasma. For analysis, we coregistered PET images to individual MR images and automatically identified 27 volumes of interest. We used 1-tissue-compartment graphical analysis with 6 linearized solutions of the fundamental binding equation, with the metabolite-corrected arterial plasma curves as input function, to estimate the kinetic parameters of (11)C-yohimbine. With the lowest steady-state distribution volume (VT), determined in the corpus callosum, we calculated the binding potential (receptor availability) of the radioligand in other regions.

Results: The linear regressions yielded similar estimates of the kinetic parameters. The cortical values of VT ranged from 0.82 mL cm(-3) in the right frontal cortex to 0.46 mL cm(-3) in the corpus callosum, with intermediate VT values in subcortical structures. Binding potentials averaged 0.6-0.8 in the cortex and 0.2-0.5 in subcortical regions.

Conclusion: The maps of (11)C-yohimbine binding to α2 adrenoceptors in human brain had the highest values in cortical areas and hippocampus, with moderate values in subcortical structures, as found also in vitro. The results confirm the usefulness of the tracer (11)C-yohimbine for mapping α2 adrenoceptors in human brain in vivo.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25635132/
Quantification of P-glycoprotein function at the human blood-brain barrier using [18F]MC225 and PET,"Pascalle Mossel, Wejdan M Arif, Giordana Salvi De Souza, Lara Garcia Varela, Chris W J van der Weijden, Hendrikus H Boersma, Antoon T M Willemsen, Ronald Boellaard, Philip H Elsinga, Ronald J H Borra, Rudi A J O Dierckx, Adriaan A Lammertsma, Anna L Bartels, Gert Luurtsema","Introduction: P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is one of the most studied efflux transporters at the blood-brain barrier. It plays an important role in brain homeostasis by protecting the brain from a variety of endogenous and exogeneous substances. Changes in P-gp function are associated both with the onset of neuropsychiatric diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, and with drug-resistance, for example in treatment-resistant depression. The most widely used approach to measure P-gp function in vivo is (R)-[11C]verapamil PET. (R)-[11C]verapamil is, however, an avid P-gp substrate, which complicates the use of this tracer to measure an increase in P-gp function as its baseline uptake is already very low. [18F]MC225 was developed to measure both increases and decreases in P-gp function.

Aim: The aim of this study was (1) to identify the pharmacokinetic model that best describes [18F]MC225 kinetics in the human brain and (2) to determine test-retest variability.

Methods: Five (2 male, 3 female) of fourteen healthy subjects (8 male, 6 female, age 67 ± 5 years) were scanned twice (injected dose 201 ± 47 MBq) with a minimum interval of 2 weeks between scans. Each scanning session consisted of a 60-min dynamic [18F]MC225 scan with continuous arterial sampling. Whole brain grey matter data were fitted to a single tissue compartment model, and to reversible and irreversible two tissue-compartment models to obtain various outcome parameters (in particular the volume of distribution (VT), Ki, and the rate constants K1and k2). In addition, a reversible two-tissue compartment model with fixed k3/k4was included. The preferred model was selected based on the weighted Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) score. Test-retest variability (TRTV) was determined to assess reproducibility.

Results: Sixty minutes post-injection, the parent fraction was 63.8 ± 4.0%. The reversible two tissue compartment model corrected for plasma metabolites with an estimated blood volume (VB) showed the highest AIC weight score of 34.3 ± 17.6%. The TRVT of the VTfor [18F]MC225 PET scans was 28.3 ± 20.4% for the whole brain grey matter region using this preferred model.

Conclusion: [18F]MC225 VT, derived using a reversible two-tissue compartment model, is the preferred parameter to describe P-gp function in the human BBB. This outcome parameter has an average test-retest variability of 28%.

Quantitative Evaluation of Tumor Early Response to a Vascular-Disrupting Agent with Dynamic PET,"Ning Guo, Fan Zhang, Xiaomeng Zhang, Jinxia Guo, Lixin Lang, Dale O Kiesewetter, Gang Niu, Quanzheng Li, Xiaoyuan Chen","Purpose: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the early response of tumors to a vascular-disrupting agent (VDA) VEGF121/recombinant toxin gelonin (rGel) using dynamic [(18)F]FPPRGD2 positron emission tomography (PET) and kinetic parameter estimation.

Procedures: Two tumor xenograft models: U87MG (highly vascularized) and A549 (moderately vascularized), were selected, and both were randomized into treatment and control groups. Sixty-minute dynamic PET scans with [(18)F]FPPRGD2 that targets to integrin αvβ3 were performed at days 0 (baseline), 1, and 3 since VEGF121/rGel treatment started. Dynamic PET-derived binding potential (BPND) and parametric maps were compared with tumor uptake (%ID/g) and the static PET image at 1 h after the tracer administration.

Results: The growth of U87MG tumor was obviously delayed upon VEGF121/rGel treatment. A549 tumor was not responsive to the same treatment. BPND of treated U87MG tumors decreased significantly at day 1 (p < 0.05), and the difference was more significant at day 3 (p < 0.01), compared with the control group. However, the tracer uptake (%ID/g) derived from static images at 1-h time point did not show significant difference between the treated and control tumors until day 3. Little difference in tracer uptake (%ID/g) or BPND was found between treated and control A549 tumors. Considering the tracer retention in tumor and the slower clearance due to damaged tumor vasculature after treatment, BPND representing the actual specific binding portion appears to be more sensitive and accurate than the semiquantitative parameters (such as %ID/g) derived from static images to assess the early response of tumor to VDA treatment.

Conclusions: Quantitative analysis based on dynamic PET with [(18)F]FPPRGD2 shows advantages in distinguishing effective from ineffective treatment during the course of VEGF121/rGel therapy at early stage and is therefore more sensitive in assessing therapy response than static PET.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25896816/
[11C]-NS 4194 versus [11C]-DASB for PET imaging of serotonin transporters in living porcine brain,"Svend B Jensen, Donald F Smith, Dirk Bender, Steen Jakobsen, Dan Peters, Elsebet Ø Nielsen, Gunnar M Olsen, Jørgen Scheel-Krüger, Alan Wilson, Paul Cumming","In vitro, the novel diazabicyclononane NS 4194 has several thousand-fold selectivity for blocking the transport into rat brain synaptosomes of [(3)H]-serotonin in comparison to [(3)H]-dopamine or [(3)H]-noradrenaline. We have prepared [(11)C]-NS 4194 in order to test its properties for PET imaging of brain serotonin transporters in comparison with the well-documented tracer [(11)C]-DASB. Both compounds had rapid clearance from blood to brain of living pigs. The apparent equilibrium distribution volumes in cerebellum were 35 ml g(-1) for [(11)C]-NS 4194 and 11 ml g(-1) for [(11)C]-DASB. Pretreatment of pigs with citalopram did not reduce the uptake of either tracer in cerebellum, validating the use of that tissue as a nonbinding reference tissue for kinetic analysis of specific binding. The binding potential (pB) calculated for [(11)C]-NS 4194 using arterial input models was close to 0.5 in the telencephalon, and was 60% displaced by citalopram. However, the reference tissue method of Lammertsma was unsuited to calculate pB for this tracer, apparently due to its excessive nonspecific binding. In contrast to the relatively homogeneous binding of [(11)C]-NS 4194, the pB of [(11)C]-DASB ranged from 0.6 in frontal cortex to 2 in the mesencephalon when calculated by the method of Lammertsma. Parametric maps of the pB of [(11)C]-DASB showed a pattern consistent with the known distribution of serotonin transporters in pig brain in vitro, and there was a uniform displacement of 80% of the specific binding after citalopram treatment in vivo. In conclusion, [(11)C]-DASB is in several respects superior to [(11)C]-NS 4194 for the detection of serotonin uptake sites by PET.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12774301/
18 kDa translocator protein positron emission tomography facilitates early and robust tumor detection in the immunocompetent SB28 glioblastoma mouse model,"Laura M Bartos, Sabrina V Kirchleitner, Jens Blobner, Karin Wind, Lea H Kunze, Adrien Holzgreve, Lukas Gold, Artem Zatcepin, Zeynep Ilgin Kolabas, Selin Ulukaya, Lorraine Weidner, Stefanie Quach, Denise Messerer, Peter Bartenstein, Joerg C Tonn, Markus J Riemenschneider, Sibylle Ziegler, Louisa von Baumgarten, Nathalie L Albert, Matthias Brendel","Introduction: The 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO) receives growing interest as a biomarker in glioblastoma. Mouse models can serve as an important tool for the investigation of biomarkers in glioblastoma, but several glioblastoma models indicated only low TSPO-PET signals in contrast to high TSPO-PET signals of human glioblastoma. Thus, we aimed to investigate TSPO-PET imaging in the syngeneic immunocompetent SB28 mouse model, which is thought to closely represent the tumor microenvironment (TME) of human glioblastoma.

Methods: Dynamic TSPO-PET/CT imaging was performed for 60 min after injection of 13.6 ± 4.2 MBq [18F]GE-180. Contrast enhanced CT (ceCT) was acquired prior to PET and served for assessment of tumor volumes and attenuation correction. SB28 and sham mice were imaged at an early (week-1;n= 6 SB28,n= 6 sham) and a late time-point (week-3;n= 8 SB28,n= 9 sham) after inoculation. Standard of truthex vivotumor volumes were obtained for SB28 mice at the late time-point. Tracer kinetics were analyzed for the lesion site and the carotid arteries to establish an image derived input function (IDIF). TSPO-PET and ceCT lesion volumes were compared withex vivovolumes by calculation of root-mean-square-errors (RMSE). Volumes of distribution (VTmax/mean) in the lesion were calculated using carotid IDIF and standardized uptake values (SUVmax/mean) were obtained for a 40-60 min time frame.

Results: Higher uptake rate constants (K1) were observed for week-1 SB28 tumor lesions when compared to week-3 SB28 tumor lesions. Highest agreement between TSPO-PET lesion volumes andex vivotumor volumes was achieved with a 50% maximum threshold (RMSE-VT: 39.7%; RMSE-SUV: 34.4%), similar to the agreement of ceCT tumor volumes (RMSE: 30.1%). Lesions of SB28 mice had higher PET signal when compared to sham mice at week-1 (VTmax 6.6 ± 2.9 vs. 3.9 ± 0.8,p= 0.035; SUVmax 2.3 ± 0.5 vs. 1.2 ± 0.1,p< 0.001) and PET signals remained at a similar level at week-3 (VTmax 5.0 ± 1.6 vs. 2.7 ± 0.8,p= 0.029; SUVmax 1.9 ± 0.5 vs. 1.2 ± 0.2,p= 0.0012). VTmax correlated with SUVmax (R2= 0.532,p< 0.001).

Conclusion: TSPO-PET imaging of immunocompetent SB28 mice facilitates early detection of tumor signals over sham lesions. SB28 tumors mirror high TSPO-PET signals of human glioblastoma and could serve as a valuable translational model to study TSPO as an imaging biomarker.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36325388/

Glutaminase 1 (GLS1) inhibition, alone and in combination with metformin, disrupts the bioenergetic demands of tumor progression and metastasis, showing promise for clinical translation.Materials and Methods:Three positron emission tomography (PET) clinical imaging agents, [18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-2-D-glucose ([18F]FDG), 3'-[18F]fluoro-3'-deoxythymidine ([18F]FLT), and (2S, 4R)-4-[18F]fluoroglutamine ([18F]GLN), were evaluated in the MG63.3 human OS xenograft mouse model, as companion imaging biomarkers after treatment for 7 d with a selective GLS1 inhibitor (CB-839, telaglenastat) and metformin, alone and in combination. Imaging and biodistribution data were collected from tumors and reference tissues before and after treatment.Results:Drug treatment altered tumor uptake of all three PET agents. Relative [18F]FDG uptake decreased significantly after telaglenastat treatment, but not within control and metformin-only groups. [18F]FLT tumor uptake appears to be negatively affected by tumor size. Evidence of a flare effect was seen with [18F]FLT imaging after treatment. Telaglenastat had a broad influence on [18F]GLN uptake in tumor and normal tissues.Conclusions:Image-based tumor volume quantification is recommended for this paratibial tumor model. The performance of [18F]FLT and [18F]GLN was affected by tumor size. [18F]FDG may be useful in detecting telaglenastat's impact on glycolysis.

Uptake and utilization of [beta-11C]5-hydroxytryptophan in human brain studied by positron emission tomography,"L Reibring, H Agren, P Hartvig, J Tedroff, H Lundqvist, P Bjurling, T Kihlberg, B Långström","The immediate precursor in the serotonin synthetic route, 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), labeled with 11C in the beta position, has become available for studies using positron emission tomography (PET) to examine serotonin formation in human brain. Normalized uptake and intracerebral utilization of tracer amounts of [beta-11C]5-HTP were studied twice in six healthy male volunteers, three of them before and after pharmacological pretreatments. The kinetic model defines regional utilization as the relative regional radioactivity accumulation rate. Repeat studies showed good reproducibility. Pretreatments with benserazide, p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA), and unlabeled 5-HTP all significantly increased uptake of [beta-11C]5-HTP. The utilization rates in both striatal and frontal cortex were higher than those in the surrounding brain, indicating that PET studies using [beta-11C]5-HTP as a ligand quantitate selective processes in the utilization of 5-HTP. We tentatively interpret uptake and utilization as a measure of brain serotonin turnover, the selectivity of which was shown by pharmacological interventions in vivo.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1292039/

Among this series, [(125)I]56 emerged as the most promising compound in terms of specific tumoral uptake and in vivo kinetic profile. To validate our multimodality concept, the radiosynthesis of [(18)F]56 was then optimized and this radiotracer has been successfully investigated for in vivo PET imaging of melanoma in B16F0- and B16F10-bearing mouse model. The therapeutic efficacy of [(131)I]56 was then evaluated in mice bearing subcutaneous B16F0 melanoma, and a significant slow down in tumoral growth was demonstrated.

Total-Body Multiparametric PET Quantification of 18 F-FDG Delivery and Metabolism in the Study of COVID-19 Recovery,"Yiran Wang, Lorenzo Nardo, Benjamin A Spencer, Yasser G Abdelhafez, Elizabeth J Li, Negar Omidvari, Abhijit J Chaudhari, Ramsey D Badawi, Terry Jones, Simon R Cherry, Guobao Wang","Conventional whole-body18F-FDG PET imaging provides a semi-quantitative evaluation of overall glucose metabolism without gaining insight into the specific transport and metabolic steps. Here we demonstrate the ability of total-body multiparametric18F-FDG PET to quantitatively evaluate glucose metabolism using macroparametric quantification and assess specific glucose delivery and phosphorylation processes using microparametric quantification for studying recovery from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Methods: The study included thirteen healthy subjects and twelve recovering COVID-19 subjects within eight weeks of confirmed diagnosis. Each subject had a dynamic18F-FDG scan on the uEXPLORER total-body PET/CT system for one hour. Semiquantitative standardized uptake value (SUV) and SUV ratio relative to blood (SUVR) were calculated for regions of interest (ROIs) in different organs to measure glucose utilization. Tracer kinetic modeling was performed to quantify microparametric rate constantsK1andk3that characterize18F-FDG blood-to-tissue delivery and intracellular phosphorylation, respectively, and a macroparameterKithat represents18F-FDG net influx rate. Statistical tests were performed to examine differences between the healthy controls and recovering COVID-19 subjects. Impact of COVID-19 vaccination was investigated. We further generated parametric images to confirm the ROI-based analysis.

Results: We detected no significant difference in lung SUV but significantly higher lung SUVR andKiin the recovering COVID-19 subjects, indicating an improved sensitivity of kinetic quantification for detecting the difference in glucose metabolism. A significant difference was also observed in the lungs with the phosphorylation ratek3, but not with the delivery rateK1, which suggests it is glucose phosphorylation, not glucose delivery, that drives the observed difference of glucose metabolism in the lungs. Meanwhile, there was no or little difference in bone marrow metabolism measured with SUV, SUVR andKi, but a significant increase in bone-marrow18F-FDG delivery rateK1in the COVID-19 group (p< 0.05), revealing a difference of glucose delivery in this immune-related organ. The observed differences were lower or similar in vaccinated COVID-19 subjects as compared to unvaccinated ones. The organ ROI-based findings were further supported by parametric images.

Conclusions: Higher lung glucose metabolism and bone-marrow glucose delivery were observed with total-body multiparametric18F-FDG PET in recovering COVID-19 subjects as compared to healthy subjects, which suggests continued inflammation due to COVID-19 during the early stages of recovery. Total-body multiparametric PET of18F-FDG delivery and metabolism can provide a more sensitive tool and more insights than conventional static whole-body18F-FDG imaging to evaluate metabolic changes in systemic diseases such as COVID-19.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37034643/
Voxelwise quantification of [(11)C](R)-rolipram PET data: a comparison between model-based and data-driven methods,"Gaia Rizzo, Mattia Veronese, Paolo Zanotti-Fregonara, Alessandra Bertoldo","This study compared model-based and data-driven methods to assess the best methodology for generating precise and accurate parametric maps of the parameters of interest in [(11)C](R)-rolipram brain positron-emission tomography studies. Parametric images were generated using (1) a two-tissue compartmental model (2TCM) solved with the hierarchical basis function method (H-BFM) linear estimator; (2) data-driven spectral-based methods: standard spectral analysis (std SA) and rank-shaping SA (RS); and (3) the Logan graphical plot. Nonphysiologic VT estimates were eliminated and the remaining ones were compared with the reference values, i.e., those obtained with a voxelwise 2TCM solved with a nonlinear estimator. With regard to voxelwise VT estimates, H-BFM showed the best agreement with weighted nonlinear least square (WNLLS) values and the lowest percentage of mean relative difference (1±1%). All methods showed comparable variability in the relative differences. H-BFM provided the best correlation with WNLLS (y=1.034x-0.013; R(2)=0.973). Despite a slight bias, the other three methods also showed good agreement and high correlation (R(2)>0.96). H-BFM yielded the most reliable voxelwise quantification of [(11)C](R)-rolipram as well as the complete description of the tracer kinetic. The Logan plot represents a valid alternative if only VT estimation is required. Its marginally higher bias was outweighed by a low computational time, ease of implementation, and robustness.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23512132/
Quantitative amyloid imaging using image-derived arterial input function,"Yi Su, Tyler M Blazey, Abraham Z Snyder, Marcus E Raichle, Russ C Hornbeck, Patricia Aldea, John C Morris, Tammie L S Benzinger","Amyloid PET imaging is an indispensable tool widely used in the investigation, diagnosis and monitoring of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Currently, a reference region based approach is used as the mainstream quantification technique for amyloid imaging. This approach assumes the reference region is amyloid free and has the same tracer influx and washout kinetics as the regions of interest. However, this assumption may not always be valid. The goal of this work is to evaluate an amyloid imaging quantification technique that uses arterial region of interest as the reference to avoid potential bias caused by specific binding in the reference region. 21 participants, age 58 and up, underwent Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) PET imaging and MR imaging including a time-of-flight (TOF) MR angiography (MRA) scan and a structural scan. FreeSurfer based regional analysis was performed to quantify PiB PET data. Arterial input function was estimated based on coregistered TOF MRA using a modeling based technique. Regional distribution volume (VT) was calculated using Logan graphical analysis with estimated arterial input function. Kinetic modeling was also performed using the estimated arterial input function as a way to evaluate PiB binding (DVRkinetic) without a reference region. As a comparison, Logan graphical analysis was also performed with cerebellar cortex as reference to obtain DVRREF. Excellent agreement was observed between the two distribution volume ratio measurements (r>0.89, ICC>0.80). The estimated cerebellum VT was in line with literature reported values and the variability of cerebellum VT in the control group was comparable to reported variability using arterial sampling data. This study suggests that image-based arterial input function is a viable approach to quantify amyloid imaging data, without the need of arterial sampling or a reference region. This technique can be a valuable tool for amyloid imaging, particularly in population where reference normalization may not be accurate.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25849581/

Advances in detector technology have led to a considerable improvement in the spatial resolution of PET (1-2 mm), enabling for the first time investigations in small experimental animals such as mice. With the developments in radiochemistry and tracer technology, a variety of endogenously expressed and exogenously introduced genes can be analysed by PET. This opens up the exciting and rapidly evolving field of molecular imaging, aiming at the non-invasive localisation of a biological process of interest in normal and diseased cells in animal models and humans in vivo. The main and most intriguing advantage of molecular imaging is the kinetic analysis of a given molecular event in the same experimental subject over time. This will allow non-invasive characterisation and ""phenotyping"" of animal models of human disease at various disease stages, under certain pathophysiological stimuli and after therapeutic intervention. The potential broad applications of imaging molecular events in vivo lie in the study of cell biology, biochemistry, gene/protein function and regulation, signal transduction, transcriptional regulation and characterisation of transgenic animals. Most importantly, molecular imaging will have great implications for the identification of potential molecular therapeutic targets, in the development of new treatment strategies, and in their successful implementation into clinical application.

A new graphic plot analysis for cerebral blood flow and partition coefficient with iodine-123-iodoamphetamine and dynamic SPECT validation studies using oxygen-15-water and PET,"T Yokoi, H Iida, H Itoh, I Kanno","To estimate regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and brain-blood partition coefficient (lambda) using a dynamic measurement, a new graphic plot analysis is proposed. By assuming a two-compartment model for tracer kinetics, we derived the linear relationship as Y(t) = K1 - k2 X(t), where Y(t) is the ratio of brain tissue activity-to-time-integrated arterial blood activity and X(t) is the ratio of time-integrated brain tissue activity-to-time-integrated arterial blood activity. A plot of Y(t) against X(t) yields a straight line and the y- and x-intercept of the regression line represent rCBF (K1) and lambda, respectively. The slope is a washout constant (-k2). This method was applied to 14 subjects with N-isopropyl-p-iodine-123 iodoamphetamine ([123I]IMP). The mean values of K1 and lambda for normal subjects were 41.3 +/- 6.7 ml/100 g/min and 29.6 +/- 6.5 ml/g, respectively, in the gray matter. A comparative study with positron emission tomography (PET) using an H2(15)O autoradiographic method revealed good correlation between IMP K1 and PET rCBF [r = 0.822; K1 = 0.842 rCBF + 0.030 (ml/g/min)]. The values of K1 using the graphical method were in excellent agreement with those using a nonlinear least-squares fitting technique (r = 0.992 for K1; r = 0.941 for lambda). The estimated K1 values in the graphical method were not changed when scanning times were varied. We conclude that a two-compartment model is acceptable for IMP kinetics within a scan time of 60 min. The graphical method gives a reliable and rapid estimation of rCBF when applied to dynamic data.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8441045/

Using the model, we examined the impact of dose on the tumor and plasma positron emission tomography (PET)-derived time-activity curves. We also sought to predict the optimal targeting index (ratio of integrated-tumor-to-integrated-plasma activity concentrations) for radioimmunotherapy.

Methods: The equilibrium rates of antibody internalization and turnover in the tumors were derived from PET images up to 96 h post-injection using compartmental modeling with a non-linear transfer rate. In addition, we serially imaged groups of LNCaP tumor-bearing mice injected with (89)Zr-J591 antibody doses ranging from antigen subsaturating to saturating to examine the suitability of using a non-linear approach and derived the time-integrated concentration (in μM∙hours) of administered tracer in tumor as a function of the administered dose of antibody.

Results: The comparison of (124)I-J591 and (89)Zr-J591 yielded similar model-derived values of the total antigen concentration and internalization rate. The association equilibrium constant (k a) was twofold higher for (124)I, but there was a ~tenfold greater tumoral efflux rate of (124)I from tumor compared to that of (89)Zr. Plots of surface-bound and internalized radiotracers indicate similar behavior up to 24 h p.i. for both (124)I-J591 and (89)Zr-J591, with the effect of differential clearance rates becoming apparent after about 35 h p.i. Estimates of J591/PSMA complex turnover were 3.9-90.5 × 10(12) (for doses from 60 to 240 μg) molecules per hour per gram of tumor (20 % of receptors internalized per hour).

Conclusions: Using quantitative compartmental model methods, surface binding and internalization rates were shown to be similar for both (124)I-J591 and (89)Zr-J591 forms, as expected. The large difference in clearance rates of the radioactivity from the tumor is likely due to differential trapping of residualizing zirconium versus non-residualizing iodine. Our non-linear model was found to be superior to a conventional linear model. This finding and the calculated activity persistence time in tumor have important implications for radioimmunotherapy and other antibody-based therapies in patients.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26801327/
Fluorine-18-labeled fluoroboronophenylalanine PET in patients with glioma,"Y Imahori, S Ueda, Y Ohmori, T Kusuki, K Ono, R Fujii, T Ido","We synthesized fluorine-18-labeled fluoroboronophenylalanine (18F-10B-FBPA), an analog of boronophenylalanine (10B-BPA), and characterized its pharmacokinetics in patients with glioma. We conducted PET studies on three types of gliomas to clarify the relationship between tumor grade and each rate constant [K1 (ml/g/min), k2 (min[-1]) and k3 (min[-1])], and here, we discuss the metabolism of the 10B-BPA analog (18F-10B-FBPA).

Methods: Thirty-three cases of primary gliomas were studied by dynamic PET using DL-18F-10B-FBPA or L-18F-10B-FBPA. Dynamic PET images of 18F-10B-FBPA incorporation into tumors were obtained, and the arterial blood samplings were performed in all cases.

Results: When the dynamic PET data were represented as Gjedde-Patlak plots, there was a positive slope, suggesting the involvement of the putative metabolic pool of this tracer. A three-compartment model using rate constants (K1, k2 and k3) was used for the kinetic analysis. The accumulation of 18F-10B-FBPA was found to correlate with the degree of malignancy, and the L form of 18F-10B-FBPA was taken up better than was the DL form. The results of dynamic PET analysis suggested that K1 (measuring amino acid transport process) is a major factor determining the accumulation of 18F-10B-FBPA. A comparison of the rate constants revealed that k3 (metabolic process) did not correlate with the degree of malignancy. The absence of evident differences in k3 between DL and L forms suggests that k3 represents phenomena that are not dependent on the native form of L.

Conclusion: These PET data will be of practical use for diagnosis of malignancy and direct prediction of the effectiveness of boron neutron capture therapy using 10B-BPA.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9476945/
Automated region definition for cardiac nitrogen-13-ammonia PET imaging,"O Muzik, R Beanlands, E Wolfe, G D Hutchins, M Schwaiger","In combination with PET, the tracer 13N-ammonia can be employed for the noninvasive quantification of myocardial perfusion at rest and after pharmacological stress. The purpose of this study was to develop an analysis method for the quantification of regional myocardial blood flow in the clinical setting. The algorithm includes correction for patient motion, an automated definition of multiple regions and display of absolute flows in polar map format. The effects of partial volume and blood to tissue cross-contamination were accounted for by optimizing the radial position of regions to meet fundamental assumptions of the kinetic model. In order to correct for motion artifacts, the myocardial displacement was manually determined based on edge-enhanced images. The obtained results exhibit the capability of the presented algorithm to noninvasively assess regional myocardial perfusion in the clinical environment.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8429358/
Comparison of [11C]UCB-J and [18F]FDG PET in Alzheimer's disease: A tracer kinetic modeling study,"Ming-Kai Chen, Adam P Mecca, Mika Naganawa, Jean-Dominique Gallezot, Takuya Toyonaga, Jayanta Mondal, Sjoerd J Finnema, Shu-Fei Lin, Ryan S O'Dell, Julia W McDonald, Hannah R Michalak, Brent Vander Wyk, Nabeel B Nabulsi, Yiyun Huang, Amy Ft Arnsten, Christopher H van Dyck, Richard E Carson","[11C]UCB-J PET for synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2 A (SV2A) has been proposed as a suitable marker for synaptic density in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We compared [11C]UCB-J binding for synaptic density and [18F]FDG uptake for metabolism (correlated with neuronal activity) in 14 AD and 11 cognitively normal (CN) participants. We assessed both absolute and relative outcome measures in brain regions of interest, i.e.,K1orR1for [11C]UCB-J perfusion,VT(volume of distribution) orDVRto cerebellum for [11C]UCB-J binding to SV2A; andKiorKiRto cerebellum for [18F]FDG metabolism. [11C]UCB-J binding and [18F]FDG metabolism showed a similar magnitude of reduction in the medial temporal lobe of AD -compared to CN participants. However, the magnitude of reduction of [11C]UCB-J binding in neocortical regions was less than that observed with [18F]FDG metabolism. Inter-tracer correlations were also higher in the medial temporal regions between synaptic density and metabolism, with lower correlations in neocortical regions. [11C]UCB-J perfusion showed a similar pattern to [18F]FDG metabolism, with high inter-tracer regional correlations. In summary, we conducted the first in vivo PET imaging of synaptic density and metabolism in the same AD participants and reported a concordant reduction in medial temporal regions but a discordant reduction in neocortical regions.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33757318/
"18F-F13640 preclinical evaluation in rodent, cat and primate as a 5-HT1A receptor agonist for PET neuroimaging","Benjamin Vidal, Sylvain Fieux, Matthieu Colom, Thierry Billard, Caroline Bouillot, Olivier Barret, Cristian Constantinescu, Gilles Tamagnan, Adrian Newman-Tancredi, Luc Zimmer","Serotonin 1A receptors are known to play an important role in many psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. Currently, all available 5-HT1Areceptor PET radiopharmaceuticals that are radiolabeled with fluorine-18 are antagonists. As agonists bind preferentially to the high-affinity state of receptors, it would be of great interest to develop agonist radioligands which could provide a measure of the functional 5-HT1Areceptors in pathophysiological processes. The 5-HT1Areceptor agonist candidates we recently proposed had promising in vitro properties but were not optimal in terms of PET imaging. F13640, a.k.a befiradol or NLX-112, is a 5-HT1Areceptor agonist with a high affinity (Ki = 1 nM) and a high selectivity that would be suitable for a potential PET radiopharmaceutical. With propose here the first preclinical evaluation of18F-F13640.18F-F13640's nitro-precursor was synthesized and radiolabeled via a fluoro-nucleophilic substitution. Its radiopharmacological characterization included autoradiographic studies, metabolic studies, and in vivo PET scans in rat, cat and non-human primate. Some of the results were compared with the radiotracer18F-MPPF, a 5-HT1Areceptor antagonist. The radiochemical purity of18F-F13640 was > 98%. In vitro binding pattern was consistent with the 5-HT1Areceptor distribution. Metabolic studies revealed that the radiotracer rapidly entered the brain and led to few brain radiometabolites. Although18F-F13640 in vivo binding was blocked by the 5-HT1Aantagonist WAY-100635 and the 5-HT1Aagonist 8-OH-DPAT, the distribution pattern was markedly different from antagonist radiotracers in the three species, suggesting it provides novel information on 5-HT1Areceptors. Preliminary studies also suggest a high sensitivity of18F-F13640 to endogenous serotonin release.18F-F13640 has suitable characteristics for probing in vitro and in vivo the 5-HT1Areceptors in high-affinity state. Quantification analyses with kinetic modeling are in progress to prepare the first-in-man study of18F-F13640.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29730825/
The synthesis of 18F-FDS and its potential application in molecular imaging,"Zi-Bo Li, Zhanhong Wu, Qizhen Cao, David W Dick, Jeffrey R Tseng, Sanjiv S Gambhir, Xiaoyuan Chen","Purpose: 2-deoxy-2-[(18)F]fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) is the most commonly used positron emission tomography (PET) tracer for oncological and neurological imaging, but it has limitations on detecting tumor or inflammation in brain gray matter. In this study, we describe the development of 2-deoxy-2-[(18)F]fluorosorbitol ((18)F-FDS) and its possible application in lesion detection around brain area.

Procedures: (18)F-FDS was obtained by reduction of FDG using NaBH(4) (81 +/- 4% yield in 30 min). Cell uptake/efflux experiments in cell culture and small animal PET imaging on tumor and inflammation models were performed.

Results: Despite the low accumulation in cell culture, (18)F-FDS had good tumor uptake and contrast in the subcutaneous U87MG tumor model (4.54%ID/g at 30 min post-injection). Minimal uptake in the normal mouse brain facilitated good tumor contrast in both U87MG and GL-26 orthotopic tumor models. (18)F-FDS also had increased uptake in the inflamed foci of the TPA-induced acute inflammation model.

Conclusions: Because of the ease of synthesis and favorable in vivo kinetics, (18)F-FDS may have potential applications in certain cases where FDG is inadequate (e.g., brain tumor).",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18097725/
"Initial evaluation of 11C-DPA-713, a novel TSPO PET ligand, in humans","Christopher J Endres, Martin G Pomper, Michelle James, Ovsev Uzuner, Dima A Hammoud, Crystal C Watkins, Aaron Reynolds, John Hilton, Robert F Dannals, Michael Kassiou","Translocator protein (TSPO) is upregulated in activated microglia and thus can serve as a marker of neuroinflammation. Recently, a novel radioligand, (11)C-N,N-diethyl-2-[2-(4-methoxyphenyl)-5,7-dimethyl-pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidin-3-yl]-acetamide ((11)C-DPA-713), has been described that binds to TSPO with high affinity. Here, we report the first examination of (11)C-DPA-713 in human subjects using PET.

Methods: Five healthy controls were studied with PET for 90 min after a bolus injection of high-specific-activity (11)C-DPA-713. For comparison, 2 additional healthy controls were studied with (11)C-R-PK11195. Arterial blood sampling and metabolite analysis were performed to allow the accurate quantification of tracer kinetics. Tracer uptake was evaluated for several brain regions. Tissue time-activity curves were fitted using 1- and 2-tissue-compartment models, with goodness-of-fit tests showing a preference for the 2-tissue model.

Results: In the healthy brain, the average plasma-to-tissue clearance and the total volume of distribution were an order of magnitude larger than measured for (11)C-R-PK11195. Accordingly, dose-normalized time-activity curves showed that (11)C-DPA-713 gives a larger brain signal.

Conclusion: Studies in patient populations will help determine whether (11)C-DPA-713 provides better sensitivity for evaluating increased TSPO expression. This initial study in humans shows that (11)C-DPA-713 is a promising ligand for evaluating TSPO binding with PET.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19617321/
Simultaneous in vivo magnetic resonance imaging and radioactive measurements with the beta-MicroProbe,"A Desbrée, L Rbah, J-B Langlois, D Grenier, R Mastrippolito, F Pain, L Pinot, P Lanièce, L Zimmer, H Gurden","Purpose: Multimodal instrumentation is a new technical approach allowing simultaneous and complementary in vivo recordings of complementary biological parameters. To elucidate further the physiopathological mechanisms in intact small animal models, especially for brain studies, a challenging issue is the actual coupling of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques with positron emission tomography (PET): it has been shown that running the technology for radioactive imaging in a magnet alters the spatiotemporal performance of both modalities. Thus, we propose an alternative coupling of techniques that uses the beta-MicroProbe instead of PET for local measurements of radioactivity coupled with MRI.

Methods: We simultaneously recorded local radioactivity due to [(18)F]MPPF (a 5-HT(1A) receptor PET radiotracer) binding in the hippocampus with the beta-MicroProbe and carried out anatomical MRI in the same anaesthetised rat.

Results: The comparison of [(18)F]MPPF kinetics obtained from animals in a magnet with kinetics from a control group outside the magnet allowed us to determine the stability of tracer biokinetic measurements over time in the magnet. We were thus able to show that the beta-MicroProbe reliably measures radioactivity in rat brains under an intense magnetic field of 7 Tesla.

Conclusion: The biological validation of a beta-MicroProbe/MRI dual system reported here opens up a wide range of future multimodal approaches for functional and pharmacological measurements by the probe combined with various magnetic resonance technologies, including anatomical MRI, functional MRI and MR spectroscopy.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17594091/

Previously obtained results with macrophage tracer (R)-[11C]PK11195 were encouraging, but the imaging signal could be further improved by reduction of background uptake. Recently, the novel macrophage tracer [18F]fluoro-PEG-folate was developed. This tracer showed excellent targeting of the folate receptor β on activated macrophages in synovial tissue in a preclinical arthritic rat model. We performed three substudies to investigate the biodistribution, potential for imaging arthritis and kinetic properties of [18F]fluoro-PEG-folate in RA patients. Firstly, biodistribution demonstrated fast clearance of [18F]fluoro-PEG-folate from heart and blood vessels and no dose limiting uptake in organs. Secondly, [18F]fluoro-PEG-folate showed uptake in arthritic joints with significantly lower background and hence significantly higher target-to-background ratios as compared to reference macrophage tracer (R)-[11C]PK11195. Lastly, dynamic scanning demonstrated fast tracer uptake in affected joints, reaching a plateau after 1 minute, co-existing with a rapid blood clearance. In conclusion, this first in man study demonstrates the potential of [18F]fluoro-PEG-folate to image arthritis activity in RA with favourable imaging characteristics of rapid clearance and low background uptake, that allow for detection of inflammatory activity in the whole body.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31974480/
"Dynamic PET and SPECT imaging with radioiodinated, amyloid-reactive peptide p5 in mice: a positive role for peptide dehalogenation","Emily B Martin, Stephen J Kennel, Tina Richey, Craig Wooliver, Dustin Osborne, Angela Williams, Alan Stuckey, Jonathan S Wall","Dynamic molecular imaging provides bio-kinetic data that is used to characterize novel radiolabeled tracers for the detection of disease. Amyloidosis is a rare protein misfolding disease that can affect many organs. It is characterized by extracellular deposits composed principally of fibrillar proteins and hypersulfated proteoglycans. We have previously described a peptide, p5, which binds preferentially to amyloid deposits in a murine model of reactive (AA) amyloidosis. We have determined the whole body distribution of amyloid by molecular imaging techniques using radioiodinated p5. The loss of radioiodide from imaging probes due to enzymatic reaction has plagued the use of radioiodinated peptides and antibodies. Therefore, we studied iodine-124-labeled p5 by using dynamic PET imaging of both amyloid-laden and healthy mice to assess the rates of amyloid binding, the relevance of dehalogenation and the fate of the radiolabeled peptide. Rates of blood pool clearance, tissue accumulation and dehalogenation of the peptide were estimated from the images. Comparisons of these properties between the amyloid-laden and healthy mice provided kinetic profiles whose differences may prove to be indicative of the disease state. Additionally, we performed longitudinal SPECT/CT imaging with iodine-125-labeled p5 up to 72h post injection to determine the stability of the radioiodinated peptide when bound to the extracellular amyloid. Our data show that amyloid-associated peptide, in contrast to the unbound peptide, is resistant to dehalogenation resulting in enhanced amyloid-specific imaging. These data further support the utility of this peptide for detecting amyloidosis and monitoring potential therapeutic strategies in patients.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25102446/
Amphetamine challenge decreases yohimbine binding to α2 adrenoceptors in Landrace pig brain,"Anne M Landau, Doris J Doudet, Steen Jakobsen","Rationale: The noradrenaline (NA) system is implicated in neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders; however, our understanding is impaired by the lack of well-validated radioligands to assess NA function and release. Yohimbine, an α2 adrenoceptor antagonist, has recently been developed as a carbon-11 [11C]-labeled radioligand for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging studies.

Objectives: Here we explore the hypothesis that yohimbine can be used as an in vivo tracer of NA receptor binding and release during amphetamine challenges in Landrace pigs.

Methods: Pigs underwent baseline PET scans with [11C]yohimbine and were then challenged with 10 mg/kg d-amphetamine 20 min prior to a second [11C]yohimbine scan. Using the Logan analysis model, volumes of distribution were calculated from fits of the kinetic data 25-90 min post-yohimbine injection.

Results: Amphetamine decreased [11C]yohimbine volume of distribution in the brain regions under investigation, including the thalamus, caudate nucleus, and cortical regions.

Conclusion: These data suggest that the binding of [11C]yohimbine to α2 adrenoceptors may be displaceable by increases in synaptic concentrations of the endogenous ligand, NA, and possibly dopamine, suggesting the possibility that [11C]yohimbine may be used as a surrogate marker of NA release in vivo.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22227612/
Presynaptic monoaminergic vesicles in Parkinson's disease and normal aging,"K A Frey, R A Koeppe, M R Kilbourn, T M Vander Borght, R L Albin, S Gilman, D E Kuhl","We present development and human application of a method for determining the regional cerebral density of the type 2 vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT2) using positron emission tomography (PET) and [11C]dihydrotetrabenazine (DTBZ). Previous animal studies indicate striatal VMAT2 density is linearly related to the integrity of substantia nigra dopamine neurons and is not subject to drug- or lesion-compensatory regulation. In the present studies, kinetic compartmental modeling was employed to estimate blood-brain [11C]DTBZ transport (K1) and VMAT2 binding site density (tissue-to-plasma DTBZ distribution volume, DV) from the cerebral and plasma DTBZ time courses after intravenous tracer injection. In controls, we found reductions of putamen DTBZ DVwith advancing age, corresponding to losses of 0.77% per year in specific VMAT2 binding. Parkinson's disease (PD) patients had reduction in specific DTBZ DV in the putamen (-61%) and in the caudate nucleus (-43%). There was no overlap of lowest specific putamen DTBZ DV between individual elderly controls and PD patients. The present results indicate the suitability of [11C]DTBZ PET for objective quantification of nigrostriatal integrity, including evaluation of PD progression and its possible therapeutic modification.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9007092/
Characterization of 11C-GSK1482160 for Targeting the P2X7 Receptor as a Biomarker for Neuroinflammation,"Paul R Territo, Jill A Meyer, Jonathan S Peters, Amanda A Riley, Brian P McCarthy, Mingzhang Gao, Min Wang, Mark A Green, Qi-Huang Zheng, Gary D Hutchins","The purinergic receptor subtype 7 (P2X7R) represents a novel molecular target for imaging neuroinflammation via PET. GSK1482160, a potent P2X7R antagonist, has high receptor affinity, high blood-brain barrier penetration, and the ability to be radiolabeled with11C. We report the initial physical and biologic characterization of this novel ligand.Methods:11C-GSK1482160 was synthesized according to published methods. Cell density studies were performed on human embryonic kidney cell lines expressing human P2X7R (HEK293-hP2X7R) and underwent Western blotting, an immunofluorescence assay, and radioimmunohistochemistry analysis using P2X7R polyclonal antibodies. Receptor density and binding potential were determined by saturation and association-disassociation kinetics, respectively. Peak immune response to lipopolysaccharide treatment in mice was determined in time course studies and analyzed via Iba1 and P2X7R Western blotting and Iba1 immunohistochemistry. Whole-animal biodistribution studies were performed on saline- or lipopolysaccharide-treated mice at 15, 30, and 60 min after radiotracer administration. Dynamic in vivo PET/CT was performed on the mice at 72 h after administration of saline, lipopolysaccharide, or lipopolysaccharide + blocking, and 2-compartment, 5-parameter tracer kinetic modeling of brain regions was performed.Results:P2X7R changed linearly with concentrations or cell numbers. For high-specific-activity11C-GSK1482160, receptor density and Kdwere 1.15 ± 0.12 nM and 3.03 ± 0.10 pmol/mg, respectively, in HEK293-hP2X7R membranes. Association constantkon, dissociation constantkoff, and binding potential (kon/koff) in HEK293-hP2X7R cells were 0.2312 ± 0.01542 min-1⋅nM-1, 0.2547 ± 0.0155 min-1, and 1.0277 ± 0.207, respectively. Whole-brain Iba1 expression in lipopolysaccharide-treated mice peaked by 72 h on immunohistochemistry, and Western blot analysis of P2X7R for saline- and lipopolysaccharide-treated brain sections showed a respective 1.8- and 1.7-fold increase in signal enhancement at 72 h. Biodistribution of11C-GSK1482160 in saline- and lipopolysaccharide-treated mice at 72 h was statistically significant across all tissues studied. In vivo dynamic11C-GSK1482160 PET/CT of mice at 72 h after administration of saline, lipopolysaccharide, or lipopolysaccharide + blocking showed a 3.2-fold increase and 97% blocking by 30 min. The total distribution volumes for multiple cortical regions and the hippocampus showed statistically significant increases and were blocked by an excess of authentic standard GSK1482160.Conclusion:The current study provides compelling data that support the suitability of11C-GSK1482160 as a radioligand targeting P2X7R, a biomarker of neuroinflammation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27765863/
In vivo quantification of the [(11)C]DASB binding in the normal canine brain using positron emission tomography,"Olivia Taylor, Nick Van Laeken, Filip De Vos, Ingeborgh Polis, Tim Bosmans, Ingeborg Goethals, Rik Achten, Andre Dobbeleir, Eva Vandermeulen, Chris Baeken, Jimmy Saunders, Kathelijne Peremans","Background: [(11)C]-3-amino-4-(2-dimethylaminomethyl-phenylsulfanyl)-benzonitrile ([(11)C]DASB) is currently the mostly used radiotracer for positron emission tomography (PET) quantitative studies of the serotonin transporter (SERT) in the human brain but has never been validated in dogs. The first objective was therefore to evaluate normal [(11)C]DASB distribution in different brain regions of healthy dogs using PET. The second objective was to provide less invasive and more convenient alternative methods to the arterial sampling-based kinetic analysis.

Results: A dynamic acquisition of the brain was performed during 90 min. The PET images were coregistered with the magnetic resonance images taken prior to the study in order to manually drawn 20 regions of interest (ROIs). The highest radioactivity concentration of [(11)C]DASB was observed in the hypothalamus, raphe nuclei and thalamus and lowest levels in the parietal cortex, occipital cortex and cerebellum. The regional radioactivity in those 20 ROIs was quantified using the multilinear reference tissue model 2 (MRTM2) and a semi-quantitative method. The values showed least variability between 40 and 60 min and this time interval was set as the optimal time interval for [(11)C]DASB quantification in the canine brain. The correlation (R(2)) between the MRTM2 and the semi-quantitative method using the data between 40 and 60 min was 99.3% (two-tailed p-value < 0.01).

Conclusions: The reference tissue models and semi-quantitative method provide a more convenient alternative to invasive arterial sampling models in the evaluation of the SERT of the normal canine brain. The optimal time interval for static scanning is set at 40 to 60 min after tracer injection.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26704517/
Cytolytic virus activation therapy and treatment monitoring for Epstein-Barr virus associated nasopharyngeal carcinoma in a mouse tumor model,"Zlata Novalić, Sandra A W M Verkuijlen, Mariska Verlaan, Jos L H Eersels, Inge de Greeuw, Carla F M Molthoff, Jaap M Middeldorp, Astrid E Greijer","Undifferentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is 100% associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Expression of viral proteins in the tumor cells is highly restricted. EBV reactivation by CytoLytic Virus Activation (CLVA) therapy triggers de novo expression of early viral kinases (PK and TK) and uses antiviral treatment to kill activated cells. The mechanism of tumor elimination by CLVA was analyzed in NPC mouse model using C666.1 cells. Valproic acid (VPA) was combined with gemcitabine (GCb) to stimulate EBV reactivation, followed by antiviral treatment with ganciclovir (GCV). A single cycle of CLVA treatment resulted in specific tumor cell killing as indicated by reduced tumor volume, loss of EBV-positive cells in situ, and paralleled by decreased EBV DNA levels in circulation, which was more pronounced than treatment with GCb alone. In vivo reactivation was confirmed by presence of lytic gene transcripts and proteins in tumors 6 days after GCb/VPA treatment. Virus reactivation was visualized by [124I]-FIAU accumulation in tumors using PET-scan. This studied showed that CLVA therapy is a potent EBV-specific targeting approach for killing tumor cells. The [124I]-FIAU appears valuable as PET tracer for studies on CLVA drug dosage and kinetics in vivo, and may find clinical application in treatment monitoring.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28853217/
Noninvasive quantification of regional myocardial blood flow in coronary artery disease with oxygen-15-labeled carbon dioxide inhalation and positron emission tomography,"L I Araujo, A A Lammertsma, C G Rhodes, E O McFalls, H Iida, E Rechavia, A Galassi, R De Silva, T Jones, A Maseri","Background: Oxygen-15-labeled water is a diffusible, metabolically inert myocardial blood flow tracer with a short half-life (2 minutes) that can be used quantitatively with positron emission tomography (PET). The purpose of this study was to validate a new technique to quantify myocardial blood flow (MBF) in animals and to assess its application in patients.

Methods and results: The technique involves the administration of 15O-labeled carbon dioxide (C15O2) and rapid dynamic scanning. Arterial and myocardial time activity curves were fitted to a single tissue compartment tracer kinetic model to estimate MBF in each myocardial region. Validation studies consisted of 52 simultaneous measurements of MBF with PET and gamma-labeled microspheres in nine closed-chest dogs over a flow range of 0.5-6.1 ml/g/min. A good correlation between the two methods was obtained (y = 0.36 + 1.0x, r = 0.91). Human studies consisted of 11 normal volunteers and eight patients with chronic stable angina and single-vessel disease, before and after intravenous dipyridamole infusion. In the normal group, MBF was homogeneous throughout the left ventricle both at rest and after administration of dipyridamole (0.88 +/- 0.08 ml/g/min and 3.52 +/- 1.12 ml/g/min, respectively; p less than or equal to 0.001). In patients, resting MBF was similar in the distribution of the normal and stenotic arteries (1.03 +/- 0.23 and 0.93 +/- 0.21 ml/g/min, respectively). After dipyridamole infusion, MBF in normally perfused areas increased to 2.86 +/- 0.83 ml/g/min, whereas in the regions supplied by stenotic arteries it increased to only 1.32 +/- 0.27 ml/g/min (p less than or equal to 0.001).

Conclusions: PET with C15O2 inhalation provides an accurate noninvasive quantitative method for measuring regional myocardial blood flow in patients.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1900224/
Development and performance test of an online blood sampling system for determination of the arterial input function in rats,"Friedrich Roehrbacher, Jens P Bankstahl, Marion Bankstahl, Thomas Wanek, Johann Stanek, Michael Sauberer, Julia Muellauer, Thales Schroettner, Oliver Langer, Claudia Kuntner","Background: For positron emission tomography (PET) kinetic modelling, an accurate determination of the arterial input function is required. In this study, a blood sampling system was developed and tested using different radiotracers in rats.

Methods: The detector consists of pairs of lutetium yttrium oxyorthosilicate (LYSO) detectors, photomultiplier tubes and lead shield assembled within a steel casing working in coincidence mode. Rats were cannulated with microtubes in the femoral artery and vein for arterial blood sampling as well as administration of the PET tracers. Connected PTFE microtubes were centred between the LYSO crystals using a special holder. To enhance sensitivity, three layers with two coils were used. A flexible tube pump was used to ensure a constant blood flow. Performance of the detector was assessed with [(18)F]fludeoxyglucose (FDG), [(18)F]ciprofloxacin, (R)-[(11)C]verapamil, [(11)C]tariquidar, [(11)C]mephobarbital and [(11)C]MC113. Obtained input function curves were compared with manual samples drawn every 5 s during the first 3 min and further on at 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 min after radiotracer injection. After manual sampling, an arterio/venous shunt was established. Shape and area-under-the-curve (AUC; Bq/μl*h) of the input functions were evaluated.

Results: The developed detector system provided an absolute sensitivity of 6.5%. Maximum peak values agreed well between manual samples and the detector with a mean difference of -0.4% ± 7.0% (max 12.0%, min -9.9%). AUC values also exhibited an excellent correlation (R = 0.996) between manual sampling and detector measurements with a mean difference of 9.3% ± 9.7% (max 24.1%, min -3.2%). The system was able to measure peak blood activity concentration levels of 110 to 2,000 Bq/μl which corresponds to injected activities from 5.5 to 100 MBq depending on the used radiotracer, applied volume and weight of the animal.

Conclusions: This study demonstrates that the developed blood sampling system can be used for in vivo small animal PET studies in rats in a reliable way. The usage of the systems enhances the accuracy of the input curve as handling of small blood samples especially with low activity (as for C-11) is prone to measurement errors. Additionally, the radiation dose of the experimenters can be reduced, as it is not required anymore to continuously draw samples where the personal is in close contact to the radioactive animals and blood.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26501803/
13N ammonia myocardial imaging at rest and with exercise in normal volunteers. Quantification of absolute myocardial perfusion with dynamic positron emission tomography,"J Krivokapich, G T Smith, S C Huang, E J Hoffman, O Ratib, M E Phelps, H R Schelbert","Positron emission tomography (PET) was applied to the measurement of myocardial perfusion using the perfusion tracer 13N-labeled ammonia. 13N ammonia was delivered intravenously to 13 healthy volunteers both at rest and during supine bicycle exercise. Dynamic PET imaging was obtained in three cross-sectional planes for 10 minutes commencing with each injection. The left ventricle was divided into eight sectors, and a small region of interest was assigned to the left ventricular blood pool to obtain the arterial input function. The net extraction of 13N ammonia was obtained for each sector by dividing the tissue 13N concentration at 10 minutes by the integral of the input function from the time of injection to 10 minutes. With this approach for calculating net extractions, rest and exercise net extractions were not significantly different from each other. To obviate possible overestimation of the true 13N ammonia input function by contamination by 13N-labeled compounds other than 13N ammonia or by spillover from myocardium into blood pool, the net extractions were calculated using only the first 90 seconds of the blood and tissue time-activity curves. This approach for calculating net extractions yielded significant differences between rest and exercise, with an average ratio of exercise to rest of 1.38 +/- 0.34. Nonetheless, the increase was less than predicted from the average 2.7-2.8-fold increase in double product at peak exercise or the 1.7-fold increase in double product at 1 minute after exercise. However, when the first 90 seconds of dynamic data were fit with a two compartment tracer kinetic model, average perfusion rates of 0.75 +/- 0.43 ml/min/g at rest and 1.50 +/- 0.74 ml/min/g with exercise were obtained. This average increase in perfusion of 2.2-fold corresponded to similar average increases in double product. Thus, the noninvasive technique of PET imaging with 13N ammonia shows promise for future applications in determining absolute flows in patients with coronary artery disease.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2805269/
Postprandial hypoglycaemia after gastric bypass in type 2 diabetes: pathophysiological mechanisms and clinical implications,"Domenico Tricò, Luca Sacchetta, Eleni Rebelos, Noemi Cimbalo, Martina Chiriacò, Diego Moriconi, Lorenzo Nesti, Giulia Nesti, Silvia Frascerra, Maria T Scozzaro, Giuseppe Daniele, Simona Baldi, Andrea Mari, Monica Nannipieri, Andrea Natali","Aims/hypothesis: Postprandial hypoglycaemia (PPHG) is a frequent late complication of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) in people without diabetes. We aimed to examine the pathogenetic mechanisms of PPHG and its clinical consequences in people with a history of type 2 diabetes.

Methods: In this case-control study, 24 participants with type 2 diabetes treated with RYGB (14 women; median [IQR] age 53.5 [13.8] years, BMI 29.3 [6.3] kg/m2, HbA1c36.0 [6.2] mmol/mol [5.4% (0.6%)]) underwent a dual-tracer, frequently sampled, 300 min, 75 g OGTT for the diagnosis of PPHG (glucose nadir <3.0 mmol/l, or <3.3 mmol/l with symptoms). Plasma glucose, glucose tracers, insulin, C-peptide, glucagon-like peptide-1, gastric inhibitory polypeptide, glucagon, adrenaline (epinephrine), noradrenaline (norepinephrine), cortisol and NEFAs were measured. Mathematical models were implemented to estimate glucose metabolic fluxes and beta cell function. ECG recordings, cognitive testing and hypoglycaemia awareness assessments were repeated during the OGTT. Glycaemic levels and dietary habits were assessed under free-living conditions.

Results: PPHG occurred in 12 (50%) participants, mostly without symptoms, due to excessive tracer-derived glucose clearance (mean group difference ± SE in AUC0-180 min+261±72 ml min-1kg-1× min) driven by higher whole-body insulin sensitivity and early glucose-stimulated hyperinsulinaemia, the latter depending on lower insulin clearance and enhanced beta cell function, regardless of incretin hormones. PPHG participants also had defective counterregulatory hormone responses to hypoglycaemia, preventing a physiological increase in endogenous glucose production and the appearance of symptoms and signs of sympathetic cardiovascular activation and neuroglycopenia. PPHG was associated with more frequent and prolonged hypoglycaemia on 14 day continuous glucose monitoring and alterations in free-living dietary habits.

Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that post-bypass PPHG occurs frequently in individuals with a history of type 2 diabetes, often without warning symptoms, and expose its complex pathogenetic mechanisms, revealing potential therapeutic targets.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39611961/
Pilot Preclinical and Clinical Evaluation of (4S)-4-(3-[18F]Fluoropropyl)-L-Glutamate (18F-FSPG) for PET/CT Imaging of Intracranial Malignancies,"Erik S Mittra, Norman Koglin, Camila Mosci, Meena Kumar, Aileen Hoehne, Khun Visith Keu, Andrei H Iagaru, Andre Mueller, Mathias Berndt, Santiago Bullich, Matthias Friebe, Heribert Schmitt-Willich, Volker Gekeler, Lüder M Fels, Claudia Bacher-Stier, Dae Hyuk Moon, Frederick T Chin, Andrew W Stephens, Ludger M Dinkelborg, Sanjiv S Gambhir","Purpose: (S)-4-(3-[18F]Fluoropropyl)-L-glutamic acid (18F-FSPG) is a novel radiopharmaceutical for Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging. It is a glutamate analogue that can be used to measure xC- transporter activity. This study was performed to assess the feasibility of 18F-FSPG for imaging orthotopic brain tumors in small animals and the translation of this approach in human subjects with intracranial malignancies.

Experimental design: For the small animal study, GS9L glioblastoma cells were implanted into brains of Fischer rats and studied with 18F-FSPG, the 18F-labeled glucose derivative 18F-FDG and with the 18F-labeled amino acid derivative 18F-FET. For the human study, five subjects with either primary or metastatic brain cancer were recruited (mean age 50.4 years). After injection of 300 MBq of 18F-FSPG, 3 whole-body PET/Computed Tomography (CT) scans were obtained and safety parameters were measured. The three subjects with brain metastases also had an 18F-FDG PET/CT scan. Quantitative and qualitative comparison of the scans was performed to assess kinetics, biodistribution, and relative efficacy of the tracers.

Results: In the small animals, the orthotopic brain tumors were visualized well with 18F-FSPG. The high tumor uptake of 18F-FSPG in the GS9L model and the absence of background signal led to good tumor visualization with high contrast (tumor/brain ratio: 32.7). 18F-FDG and 18F-FET showed T/B ratios of 1.7 and 2.8, respectively. In the human pilot study, 18F-FSPG was well tolerated and there was similar distribution in all patients. All malignant lesions were positive with 18F-FSPG except for one low-grade primary brain tumor. In the 18F-FSPG-PET-positive tumors a similar T/B ratio was observed as in the animal model.

Conclusions: 18F-FSPG is a novel PET radiopharmaceutical that demonstrates good uptake in both small animal and human studies of intracranial malignancies. Future studies on larger numbers of subjects and a wider array of brain tumors are planned.

PET studies of dopamine receptor distribution using [18F]fluoroethylspiperone: findings in disorders related to the dopaminergic system,"K Wienhard, H H Coenen, G Pawlik, J Rudolf, P Laufer, S Jovkar, G Stöcklin, W D Heiss","PET studies of dopamine D2-receptor binding were performed in thirty patients with various disorders related to the dopaminergic system and in six healthy controls. Uptake of [18F]fluoroethylspiperone in caudate over three hours was analyzed in terms of several indices of receptor binding:caudate-to-cerebellum activity ratio, concentration of ligand as percentage of injected dose, caudate-to-blood radioactivity ratio, slope of tracer uptake curves, binding potential, kinetic constants of a three compartment model. In 14 patients brain glucose metabolism was also measured. Data on medicated patients demonstrate that the average values of most of the above parameters indicate the decreased number of available D2-receptors whereby, besides an age dependent decline, the caudate-to-cerebellum ratio affords the relatively best distinction among diagnostic groups. In individual cases, large variability among subjects permits only the classification of severe pathologies. Morphological damage and neuronal loss in the striatum may also cause abnormal low values both for the indices of receptor binding and for glucose consumption, thus providing a possible pathogenetic link between receptor dysfunction and impaired energy metabolism.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2144427/
[11C]PBR28 PET imaging is sensitive to neuroinflammation in the aged rat,"Matthew D Walker, Katherine Dinelle, Rick Kornelsen, Nathan V Lee, Qing Miao, Mike Adam, Christine Takhar, Edwin Mak, Michael Schulzer, Matthew J Farrer, Vesna Sossi","Neuroinflammation in the aging rat brain was investigated using [(11)C]PBR28 microPET (positron emission tomography) imaging. Normal rats were studied alongside LRRK2 p.G2019S transgenic rats; this mutation increases the risk of Parkinson's disease in humans. Seventy [(11)C]PBR28 PET scans were acquired. Arterial blood sampling enabled tracer kinetic modeling and estimation of VT. In vitro autoradiography was also performed. PBR28 uptake increased with age, without differences between nontransgenic and transgenic rats. In 12 months of aging (4 to 16 months), standard uptake value (SUV) increased by 56% from 0.44 to 0.69 g/mL, whereas VT increased by 91% from 30 to 57 mL/cm(3). Standard uptake value and VT were strongly correlated (r = 0.52, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.31 to 0.69, n = 37). The plasma free fraction, fp, was 0.21 ± 0.03 (mean ± standard deviation, n = 53). In vitro binding increased by 19% in 16 months of aging (4 to 20 months). The SUV was less variable across rats than VT; coefficients of variation were 13% (n = 27) and 29% (n = 12). The intraclass correlation coefficient for SUV was 0.53, but was effectively zero for VT. These data show that [(11)C]PBR28 brain uptake increases with age, implying increased microglial activation in the aged brain.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25833342/

Substantial variation in quantitative methods to measure brain amyloid burden exists in the field. The aim of this work is to investigate the impact of methodological variations to the quantification of amyloid burden using data from the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer's Network (DIAN), an autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease population. Cross-sectional and longitudinal [11C]-Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) PET imaging data from the DIAN study were analyzed. Four candidate reference regions were investigated for estimation of brain amyloid burden. A regional spread function based technique was also investigated for the correction of partial volume effects. Cerebellar cortex, brain-stem, and white matter regions all had stable tracer retention during the course of disease. Partial volume correction consistently improves sensitivity to group differences and longitudinal changes over time. White matter referencing improved statistical power in the detecting longitudinal changes in relative tracer retention; however, the reason for this improvement is unclear and requires further investigation. Full dynamic acquisition and kinetic modeling improved statistical power although it may add cost and time. Several technical variations to amyloid burden quantification were examined in this study. Partial volume correction emerged as the strategy that most consistently improved statistical power for the detection of both longitudinal changes and across-group differences. For the autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease population with PiB imaging, utilizing brainstem as a reference region with partial volume correction may be optimal for current interventional trials. Further investigation of technical issues in quantitative amyloid imaging in different study populations using different amyloid imaging tracers is warranted.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27010959/
Amino acid uptake in the skeletal muscle measured using [11C]methylaminoisobutyrate (MEAIB) and PET,"Markku R Asola, Kirsi A Virtanen, Pauliina Peltoniemi, Kjell Någren, Meixiang Yu, Kari Mattila, Sirkku Jyrkkiö, Kaj Metsärinne, Pirjo Nuutila, Juhani Knuuti","An amino acid analogue, [(11)C]MeAIB, recently introduced for oncological positron emission tomography (PET) studies, is a highly selective substrate for insulin-sensitive amino acid transport system A. The aim of this study was to study the uptake kinetics of [(11)C]MeAIB in skeletal muscle in the fasting state and during insulin stimulation. Two dynamic PET studies were carried out in 11 healthy subjects, once in the fasting state and once during euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemia (serum insulin 67+/-12 mU l(-1)). Graphical analysis was used to calculate the fractional [(11)C]MeAIB uptake rate ( K(i)). Amino acid uptake was estimated by multiplying K(i) by the serum amino acid concentration. After tracer injection, rapid uptake in muscle tissue was detected both in the fasting state and during insulin stimulation and femoral muscles were clearly visualised in both studies. In the graphical analysis, the volume of distribution of [(11)C]MeAIB plotted against normalised plasma time yielded a linear curve (the slope of which = K(i)). The fractional [(11)C]MeAIB uptake rate ( K(i)) in the femoral muscle regions increased from 0.0070+/-0.0018 min(-1) (mean+/-SD) in the fasting state to 0.0079+/-0.0020 min(-1) ( P<0.05) during insulin stimulation. When compared with the fasting state, serum total amino acid concentration decreased from 2.49+/-0.22 to 2.16+/-0.18 mmol l(-1) ( P<0.0001) and the serum concentration of six amino acids typically using system A for their transport decreased from 0.72+/-0.1 to 0.63+/-0.07 mmol l(-1) ( P=0.0001) during hyperinsulinaemia. The calculated skeletal muscle total amino acid uptake and the uptake of the six amino acids typically using system A were similar in the fasting state and during insulin clamp (17.1+/-3.2 vs 17.7+/-3.7 micro mol kg(-1) min(-1), NS, and 5.0+/-1.3 vs 5.0+/-1.4 micro mol kg(-1) min(-1), NS, respectively). The uptake rates correlated with perfusion both in the fasting state and during hyperinsulinaemia ( P<0.05). [(11)C]MeAIB PET appears to be a feasible method for measurement of amino acid uptake in human skeletal muscle. As a tracer that is not metabolised in the tissues, [(11)C]MeAIB provides simple modelling and robust data analysis and thus provides a means to investigate amino acid uptake into muscle tissue in various disease conditions known to affect protein metabolism.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12397468/
Blood metabolism of [methyl-11C]choline; implications for in vivo imaging with positron emission tomography,"A Roivainen, S Forsback, T Grönroos, P Lehikoinen, M Kähkönen, E Sutinen, H Minn","[methyl-11C]choline (11C-choline) is a radioligand potentially useful for oncological positron emission tomography (PET). As a first step towards the development of a kinetic model for quantification of 11C-choline uptake, blood metabolism of 11C-choline during PET imaging was studied in humans. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and thin-layer chromatography (TLC) were used for the analysis of 11C-choline and its radioactive metabolites. Prior to human PET imaging we studied ex vivo the biodistribution and metabolism of intravenously administered 11C-choline in rats. Our results revealed that the radioactivity accumulated particularly in kidney, lung, adrenal gland and liver. Chromatographic analysis showed that the level of unmetabolized 11C-choline in rat plasma decreased from 42% +/- 20% (mean +/- SD) at 5 min to 21% +/- 10% at 15 min after injection. In accordance with these findings, in humans the unmetabolized 11C-choline represents 62% +/- 19% of the total radioactivity in arterial plasma at 5 min after injection and 27% +/- 12% at 15 min. In human venous plasma the corresponding values were 85% +/- 12% and 48% +/- 12% at 5 and 10 min, respectively. The major metabolite observed in both human and rat plasma was identified as 11C-betaine. In human arterial plasma this maximally represented 82% +/- 9% of the total radioactivity at 25 min after radiotracer injection. By 20 min after injection, the 11C-choline and 11C-betaine in human arterial plasma reached a plateau, and their fractional activities remained nearly constant thereafter. Although most of the circulating 11C-choline in blood is transported to tissues, it does not disappear totally from blood within the first 40 min after tracer injection.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10654143/
PET imaging of angiogenesis after myocardial infarction/reperfusion using a one-step labeled integrin-targeted tracer 18F-AlF-NOTA-PRGD2,"Haokao Gao, Lixin Lang, Ning Guo, Feng Cao, Qimeng Quan, Shuo Hu, Dale O Kiesewetter, Gang Niu, Xiaoyuan Chen","Purpose: The α(v)β(3) integrin represents a potential target for noninvasive imaging of angiogenesis. The purpose of this study was to evaluate a novel one-step labeled integrin α(v)β(3)-targeting positron emission tomography (PET) probe, (18)F-AlF-NOTA-PRGD2, for angiogenesis imaging in a myocardial infarction/reperfusion (MI/R) animal model.

Methods: Male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent 45-min transient left coronary artery occlusion followed by reperfusion. The myocardial infarction was confirmed by ECG, (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) imaging, and cardiac ultrasound. In vivo PET imaging was used to determine myocardial uptake of (18)F-AlF-NOTA-PRGD2 at different time points following reperfusion. The control peptide RAD was labeled with a similar procedure and used to confirm the specificity. Ex vivo autoradiographic analysis and CD31/CD61 double immunofluorescence staining were performed to validate the PET results.

Results: Myocardial origin of the (18)F-AlF-NOTA-PRGD2 accumulation was confirmed by (18)F-FDG and autoradiography. PET imaging demonstrated increased focal accumulation of (18)F-AlF-NOTA-PRGD2 in the infarcted area which started at day 3 (0.28 ± 0.03%ID/g, p < 0.05) and peaked between 1 and 3 weeks (0.59 ± 0.16 and 0.55 ± 0.13%ID/g, respectively). The focal accumulation decreased but still kept at a higher level than the sham group after 4 months of reperfusion (0.31 ± 0.01%ID/g, p < 0.05). Pretreatment with unlabeled arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) peptide significantly decreased tracer uptake, indicating integrin specificity of this tracer. At 1 week after MI/R, uptake of the control tracer (18)F-AlF-NOTA-RAD that does not bind to integrin, in the infarcted area, was only 0.21 ± 0.01%ID/g. Autoradiographic imaging showed the same trend of uptake in the myocardial infarction area. The time course of focal tracer uptake was consistent with the pattern of vascular density and integrin β(3) expression as measured by CD31 and CD61 immunostaining analysis.

Conclusion: PET imaging using one-step labeled (18)F-AlF-NOTA-PRGD2 allows noninvasive visualization of ischemia/reperfusion-induced myocardial angiogenesis longitudinally. The favorable in vivo kinetics and easy production method of this integrin-targeted PET tracer facilitates its future clinical translation for lesion evaluation and therapy response monitoring in patients with occlusive cardiovascular diseases.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22274731/
Immuno-PET/CT Imaging of Trop2 with [18F]AlF-RESCA-T4 Differentiates Lung Cancer from Inflammation,"Wei Huang, Min Cao, Yanfei Wu, You Zhang, Shuxian An, Xinbing Pan, Xinyuan Zhou, Hongda Shao, Yihui Guan, Gang Huang, Fabrizia Gelardi, Arturo Chiti, Fang Xie, Jianjun Liu, Weijun Wei","Immuno-PET/CT imaging, a branch of molecular imaging, can noninvasively and specifically visualize biomarker expression across the body. Trophoblast cell surface antigen 2 (Trop2) is a pan-cancer biomarker and plays a crucial role in tumorigenesis through multiple signaling pathways. The study aims to develop and translate novel Trop2 single-domain antibody (sdAb) tracers for clinical use.Methods:Two sdAbs (i.e., His-tagged T4 and His-tag-free RT4) are recombinantly expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. The purities and binding kinetics are determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, high-performance liquid chromatography, and surface plasmon resonance assays. The AlF restrained complexing agent (RESCA) method is applied to develop18F-labeled sdAb tracers ([18F]AlF-RESCA-T4 and [18F]AlF-RESCA-RT4), followed by thorough preclinical imaging and blocking studies on tumor-bearing mice and a pilot clinical trial evaluating the clinical imaging safety and feasibility of [18F]AlF-RESCA-T4 immuno-PET/CT.Results:[18F]AlF-RESCA-T4 and [18F]AlF-RESCA-RT4 possess high radiochemical purities. Preclinical imaging in the T3M-4 tumor model revealed prominent uptake (percentage injected dose/g) of [18F]AlF-RESCA-T4 (11.13 ± 1.53,n= 4) and [18F]AlF-RESCA-RT4 (8.83 ± 1.22,n= 4), which were significantly reduced by coinjection of unlabeled T4 and RT4 in blocking studies.

Quantitative approaches of dynamic FDG-PET and PET/CT studies (dPET/CT) for the evaluation of oncological patients,"Antonia Dimitrakopoulou-Strauss, Leyun Pan, Ludwig G Strauss","Objectives: The use of dynamic positron emission tomography/computed tomography (dPET/CT) studies with [18F]deoxyglucose (FDG) in oncological patients is limited and primarily confined to research protocols. A more widespread application is, however, desirable, and may help to assess small therapeutic effects early after therapy as well as to differentiate borderline differences between tumour and non-tumour lesions, e.g., lipomas versus low-grade liposarcomas. The aim is to present quantification approaches that can be used for the evaluation of dPET/CT series in combination with parametric imaging and to demonstrate the feasibility with regard to tumour diagnostics and therapy management.

Methods: A 60-min data acquisition and short acquisition protocols (20-min dynamic series and a static image 60 min post injection) are discussed. A combination of a modified two-tissue compartment model and non-compartmental approaches from the chaos theory (fractal dimension of the time-activity curves) are presented. Fused PET/CT images as well as regression-based parametric images fused with CT or with PET/standardised uptake value images are demonstrated for the exact placement of volumes of interest.

Results: The two-tissue compartmental method results in the calculation of 5 kinetic parameters, the fractional blood volume VB (known also as the distribution volume), and the transport rates k1 to k4. Furthermore, the influx according to Patlak can be calculated from the transport rates. The fractal dimension of the time-activity curves describes the heterogeneity of the tracer distribution. The use of the regression-based parametric images of FDG helps to visualise the transport/perfusion and the transport/phosphorylation-dependent FDG uptake, and adds a new dimension to the existing conventional PET or PET/CT images.

Conclusions: More sophisticated quantification methods and dedicated software as well as high computational power and faster acquisition protocols can facilitate the assessment of dPET/CT, and may find use in clinical routine, in particular for the assessment of early therapeutic effects or new treatment protocols in combination with the new generation of PET/CT scanners.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23033440/
"Novel CDTA-based, Bifunctional Chelators for Stable and Inert MnII Complexation: Synthesis and Physicochemical Characterization","Christian Vanasschen, Enikő Molnár, Gyula Tircsó, Ferenc K Kálmán, Éva Tóth, Marie Brandt, Heinz H Coenen, Bernd Neumaier","In the search for MnIIMR and PET/MR imaging agents with optimal balance between thermodynamic stability, kinetic inertness, and relaxivity, two novel bifunctional MnIIchelators (BFMnCs) based on CDTA (trans-1,2-diaminocyclohexane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid) were synthesized. A six-step synthesis, involving the buildup of a functionalized trans-1,2-diaminocyclohexane core, provided CuAAC-reactive 6a and 6b bearing an alkyne or azide substituent on the cyclohexane ring, respectively (CuAAC = CuI-catalyzed azide-alkyne 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition). Thermodynamic, kinetic, and relaxometric studies were performed with 4-HET-CDTA (8a) as a ""model chelator,"" synthesized in two steps from 6a. The protonation constants revealed that 8a is slightly less basic than CDTA and forms a MnIIcomplex of marginally lower thermodynamic stability (log KMnL= 13.80 vs 14.32, respectively), while the conditional stability constant is almost identical for both chelates (pMn = 8.62 vs 8.68, respectively). Kinetic assessment of the CuII-mediated transmetalation of [Mn(4-HET-CDTA)]2-showed that proton-assisted complex dissociation is slightly slower than for [Mn(CDTA)]2-(k1= 297 vs 400 M-1s-1, respectively). Importantly, the dissociation half-life near physiological conditions (pH 7.4, 25 °C) underlined that [Mn(4-HET-CDTA)]2-is ∼35% more inert (t1/2= 16.2 vs 12.1 h, respectively). Those findings may be accounted for by a combination of reduced basicity and increased rigidity of the ligand. Analysis of the17O NMR and1H NMRD data attributed the high relaxivity of [Mn(4-HET-CDTA)]2-(r1= 4.56 mM-1s-1vs 3.65 mM-1s-1for [Mn(CDTA)]2-; 20 MHz, 25 °C) to slower rotational dynamics (τR298= 105 ps). Additionally, the fast water exchange of the complex correlates well with the value reported for [Mn(CDTA)]2-(kex298= 17.6 × 107vs 14.0 × 107s-1, respectively). Given the exquisite compromise between thermodynamic stability, kinetic inertness, and relaxivity achieved by [Mn(4-HET-CDTA)]2-, appropriately designed CuAAC-conjugates of 6a/6b are promising precursors for the preparation of targeted, bioresponsive, or high relaxivity manganese-based PET/MR tracers (52g/55MnII) and MR contrast agents (MnII).",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28650621/
No age-related changes in human benzodiazepine receptor binding measured by PET with [11C]Ro 15-4513,"T Suhara, O Inoue, K Kobayashi, K Suzuki, T Itoh, Y Tateno","The effects of age on the binding of [11C]Ro 15-4513, a partial inverse agonist of the central benzodiazepine receptor, were studied. Sixteen healthy male volunteers (21-78 years old) participated. Regional radioactivity in the brain was followed for 45 min by positron emission tomography after a bolus injection of [11C]Ro 15-4513. Similar tracer kinetics were observed in both young and old subjects. For the quantification of receptor binding in vivo, a compartment model, in which radioactivity in the pons was used as an input function, was applied. There were no significant changes in the binding potentials with age (P > 0.1) in ten brain regions. These observations delineate an interesting difference between central benzodiazepine (BZ) receptors and other neurotransmitter receptors in the human brain measured by PET that have been shown to have a reduction with age.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8264968/
Pharmacological and metabolic parameters of [18F]flubrobenguane in clinical imaging populations,"Braeden A Mair, Jason G E Zelt, Kirabo Nekesa, Zacharie Saint-Georges, Katie Dinelle, Myriam Adi, Simon Robinson, Lisa M Mielniczuk, Jakov Shlik, Rob S Beanlands, Robert A deKemp, Benjamin H Rotstein","Background: Cardiac sympathetic nervous system molecular imaging has demonstrated prognostic value. Compared with meta-[11C]hydroxyephedrine, [18F]flubrobenguane (FBBG) facilitates reliable estimation of SNS innervation using similar analytical methods and possesses a more convenient physical half-life. The aim of this study was to evaluate pharmacokinetic and metabolic properties of FBBG in target clinical cohorts.

Methods: Blood sampling was performed on 20 participants concurrent to FBBG PET imaging (healthy = NORM, non-ischemic cardiomyopathy = NICM, ischemic cardiomyopathy = ICM, post-traumatic stress disorder = PTSD). Image-derived blood time-activity curves were transformed to plasma input functions using cohort-specific corrections for plasma protein binding, plasma-to-whole blood distribution, and metabolism.

Results: The plasma-to-whole blood ratio was 0.78 ± 0.06 for NORM, 0.64 ± 0.06 for PTSD and 0.60 ± 0.14 for (N)ICM after 20 minutes. 22 ± 4% of FBBG was bound to plasma proteins. Metabolism of FBBG in (N)ICM was delayed, with a parent fraction of 0.71 ± 0.05 at 10 minutes post-injection compared to 0.53 ± 0.03 for PTSD/NORM.

We recently designed and synthesized a RGD-BBN heterodimeric peptide with both RGD and BBN motifs in one single molecule. The (18)F-labeled RGD-BBN heterodimer exhibited dual integrin alpha(v)beta(3) and GRPR targeting in a PC-3 prostate cancer model. In this study we investigated whether radiolabeled RGD-BBN tracers can be used to detect breast cancer by using microPET. Cell binding assay demonstrated that the high GRPR expressing breast cancer cells typically express low to moderate level of integrin alpha(v)beta(3), while high integrin alpha(v)beta(3) expressing breast cancer cells have negligible level of GRPR. We labeled RGD-BBN heterodimer with three positron emitting radionuclides (18)F, (64)Cu, and (68)Ga and investigated the corresponding PET radiotracers in both orthotopic T47D (GRPR(+)/low integrin alpha(v)beta(3)) and MDA-MB-435 (GRPR(-)/integrin alpha(v)beta(3)(+)) breast cancer models. The three radiotracers all possessed in vitro dual integrin alpha(v)beta(3) and GRPR binding affinity. The advantages of the RGD-BBN radiotracers over the corresponding BBN analogues are obvious for imaging MDA-MB-435 (GRPR(-)/integrin alpha(v)beta(3)(+)) tumor. (18)F-FB-PEG(3)-RGD-BBN showed lower tumor uptake than (64)Cu-NOTA-RGD-BBN and (68)Ga-NOTA-RGD-BBN but was able to visualize breast cancer tumors with high contrast. Synthesis of (64)Cu-NOTA-RGD-BBN and (68)Ga-NOTA-RGD-BBN is much faster and easier than (18)F-FB-PEG(3)-RGD-BBN. (64)Cu-NOTA-RGD-BBN showed prolonged tumor uptake but also higher liver retention and kidney uptake than (68)Ga-NOTA-RGD-BBN and (18)F-FB-PEG(3)-RGD-BBN. (68)Ga-NOTA-RGD-BBN possessed high tumor signals but also relatively high background uptake compared with the other two radiotracers. In summary, the prosthetic labeling groups, chelators, and isotopes all have a profound effect on the tumor targeting efficacy and in vivo kinetics of the RGD-BBN tracers for dual integrin and GRPR recognition. Further development of suitably labeled RGD-BBN tracers for PET imaging of cancer is warranted.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20540537/
"Uptakes and images of 38K in rabbit heart, kidney, and brain","A Takami, K Yoshida, H Tadokoro, S Kitsukawa, K Shimada, M Sato, K Suzuki, Y Masuda, S Tanada","The purpose of this study was to evaluate the kinetics and image quality of positron-emitting 38K (half-life, 7.6 min) and high-resolution small-animal PET in the heart, kidney, and brain of rabbits.

Methods: Studies were performed with 18 closed-chest anesthetized rabbits at baseline and during infusions of adenosine (0.2 mg/kg/min) and propranolol (0.5-1.0 mg/kg intravenously) using high-resolution small-animal PET. 38K was injected intravenously and dynamic PET imaging of the heart, kidney, or brain was performed for 3 min. Colored microspheres were injected into the left ventricle to measure organ blood flow. Arterial blood was withdrawn directly from the femoral artery, and, after the animals were killed, 38K activities in each organ were measured directly with a well counter. Uptake of 38K was calculated by dividing the 38K activities in each organ by the integral of the input function. The extraction fraction of 38K was estimated by dividing the uptake of 38K in each organ by the organ blood flow, measured by microspheres.

Results: The left ventricular myocardium and kidney were clearly visualized, but there was no visual 38K uptake in the brain. For the heart, kidney, and brain, respectively, average blood flow was 2.91 +/- 1.29, 5.49 +/- 0.71, and 0.57 +/- 0.11 mL/min/g, and the extraction fraction of 38K at baseline was 0.55 +/- 0.13, 0.48 +/- 0.13, and 0.022 +/- 0004. The Renkin-Crone model fit the relation between myocardial extraction and flow under a wide range of myocardial blood flow (r = 0.89).

Conclusion: 38K is a suitable tracer for noninvasively showing the potassium kinetics of the heart, kidney, and brain by PET imaging.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10768580/
"[Atraumatic approach in myocardial perfusion, metabolism and receptors by positron emission tomography]",A Syrota,"Positron emission tomography (PET) is a noninvasive visualization method that provides a quantitative representation of radioactive molecule distribution on a tissue section within an organ. PET may be compared to the quantitative autoradiography performed in animals on heart sections with carbon 14- or tritium-labelled molecules, but it has the advantages of being applicable to human beings and enabling time-related concentration studies to be carried out on various substances. By using mathematical models fatty acid consumption or cholinergic receptor density can then be measured in e.g. the interventricular septum. Myocardial perfusion is routinely measured using such tracers as rubidium 82, nitrogen 13-labelled ammonia or even oxygen 15 water or gallium 68-labelled albumin microspheres. 82 Rb and 13NH3 ammonia are strongly taken up by the myocardium. 82 Rb has properties that are similar to those of 201Tl used in nuclear medicine, and the kinetics of 13NH3 depend on both myocardial perfusion and myocardial metabolism. The myocardium can metabolize fatty acids, glucose, ketone-bodies and lactic acid. 11C-palmitate is ideal to evaluate the regional utilization of fatty acids. It has been extensively studied in dogs, where a good correlation was found between the size of experimental infarcts and that of the region where a reduction in palmitate concentration was observed. Glucose metabolism is studied by means of an 18F-labelled analogue: fluoro-deoxyglucose. Using this analogue and 11C-palmitate jointly in animals or patients with myocardial ischaemia showed an increase of glucose myocardial extraction and a decrease of palmitate uptake in the ischaemic areas. In necrotic areas, both fluoro-deoxyglucose and palmitate uptakes were extremely low.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2850773/
Introduction to imaging brain tumor metabolism with positron emission tomography (PET),P S Conti,"The need for prompt and detailed evaluation of cancers and their treatment is requiring increasingly sophisticated methodologies for in vivo assessment. Morphological detail as provided by CT and MRI has yielded significant advances in diagnostic medicine. In spite of such advances, the means of achieving the clinical goals of improved quality and quantity of life in many cancer patients remain elusive. It is becoming increasingly evident that only with the addition of complementary physiological and biochemical data will further advances occur. While neither in vivo morphological imaging with CT or MRI nor physiological imaging with PET or MRS can provide the resolution of microscopic or cellular level assessment, all can provide macroscopic or regional data. With PET, however, exploration of the kinetics or chemical processes occurring at the cellular level is providing a ""biological resolution"" not heretofore achieved with in vivo imaging. Application of this complementary morphological and biochemical diagnostic information will likely lead to significant advances in patient management in the immediate future, most of which would probably not be achievable using any individual technique. Efficacy studies should be performed, however, when introducing any new high-technology methodology into clinical practice. A number of retrospective and prospective trials on PET applications in clinical oncology are ongoing sponsored by organizations such as the Institute for Clinical PET and the Western PET Association. Detailed studies also are underway to estimate the ""cost"" of delivery of PET services to the community (146). Numerous PET feasibility studies in animal models have demonstrated that no one radiotracer serves as the best agent for tumor imaging in all cases. Such studies with radiolabeled amino acids, sugars, and nucleoside derivatives, representatives of the major classes of biomolecules, have demonstrated variable tumor uptake dependent on such parameters as the type of cancer, organ of origin, animal host, and chemical structure of the radioligand. Detailed analysis of tracer uptake using multiple ligands in a variety of animal tumor models and clinical patients suggests that while given types of cancers may be better imaged with certain radiotracers, the use of multitracer imaging provides the specific details necessary for appropriate interpretation of tumor status. In addition, in cases where the diagnosis is uncertain, such information could have a significant impact on patient management by reducing the diagnostic differential. In spite of the many successes achieved with FDG in brain tumor imaging, the most well-known example of the problems that can arise with PET image interpretation is with the use of this agent.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7874578/
18-kDa translocator protein ligand 18F-FEMPA: Biodistribution and uptake into atherosclerotic plaques in mice,"Sanna Hellberg, Johanna M U Silvola, Max Kiugel, Heidi Liljenbäck, Nina Savisto, Xiang-Guo Li, Andrea Thiele, Lutz Lehmann, Tobias Heinrich, Sonja Vollmer, Harri Hakovirta, V Jukka O Laine, Seppo Ylä-Herttuala, Juhani Knuuti, Anne Roivainen, Antti Saraste","Background: Radioligands of 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO) expressed on activated macrophages are a potential approach for imaging of inflammation in atherosclerosis. We evaluated a novel TSPO-targeted tracer18F-FEMPA for the detection of atherosclerotic plaque inflammation in mice.

Methods and results: The distribution kinetics of18F-FEMPA was evaluated by in vivo PET/CT imaging.18F-FEMPA uptake was compared in atherosclerotic (LDLR-/-ApoB100/100, n = 10) and healthy mice (C57BL/6 N, n = 7) ex vivo at twenty minutes post-injection. Biodistribution was analyzed from harvested tissue samples, and aortas were sectioned for autoradiography. Aortas of LDLR-/-ApoB100/100mice showed large, macrophage-rich atherosclerotic plaques. In vivo,18F-FEMPA showed rapid blood clearance but no difference in aortic uptake between atherosclerotic and healthy mice. In the mice studied ex vivo at 20 minutes post-injection, quantification of radioactivity in the whole aorta showed 1.3-fold higher18F-FEMPA accumulation in atherosclerotic than healthy mice (P = .028). Autoradiography showed higher tracer uptake in plaque areas with high macrophage content as compared with areas of no macrophages (count densities 190 ± 54 vs 40 ± 13 PSL/mm2, P < .001), but the uptake in the plaques was not higher than in the normal vessel wall (230 ± 78 PSL/mm2). In vitro blocking showed specific accumulation in mouse and human atherosclerotic plaques. Immunohistochemistry confirmed co-localization of TSPO and macrophages.

Conclusions: 18F-FEMPA shows rapid blood clearance and uptake in the mouse aorta. Uptake in atherosclerotic plaques correlated with the amount of macrophages, but did not exceed that in the normal vessel wall.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27225517/
The quantification of dynamic FET PET imaging and correlation with the clinical outcome in patients with glioblastoma,"Frank Thiele, Julia Ehmer, Marc D Piroth, Michael J Eble, Heinz H Coenen, Hans-Juergen Kaiser, Wolfgang M Schaefer, Ulrich Buell, Christian Boy","The PET tracer O-(2-[18F]Fluoroethyl)-l-tyrosine (FET) has been shown to be valuable for different roles in the management of brain tumours. The aim of this study was to evaluate several quantitative measures of dynamic FET PET imaging in patients with resected glioblastoma. We evaluated dynamic FET PET in nine patients with histologically confirmed glioblastoma. Following FET PET, all subjects had radiation and chemotherapy. Tumour ROIs were defined by a threshold-based region-growing algorithm. We compared several standard measures of tumour uptake and uptake kinetics: SUV, SUV/background, distribution volume ratio (DVR), weighted frame differences and compartment model parameters. These measures were correlated with disease-free and overall survival, and analysed for statistical significance. We found that several measures allowed robust quantification. SUV and distribution volume did not correlate with clinical outcome. Measures that are based on a background region (SUV/BG, Logan-DVR) highly correlated with disease-free survival (r = -0.95, p < 0.0001), but not overall survival. Some advanced measures also showed a prognostic value but no improvement over the simpler methods. We conclude that FET PET probably has a prognostic value in patients with resected glioblastoma. The ratio of SUV to background may provide a simple and valuable predictive measure of the clinical outcome. Further studies are needed to confirm these explorative results.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19717889/
Topographic basis of bimodal ventilation-perfusion distributions during bronchoconstriction in sheep,"Marcos F Vidal Melo, R Scott Harris, J Dominick H Layfield, Jose G Venegas","The distribution of ventilation-perfusion (VA/Q) ratios during bronchoconstriction measured with the multiple inert gases elimination technique is frequently bimodal. However, the topographic basis and the cause of that bimodality remain unknown. In this article, regional VA/Q is quantified by three-dimensional positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of methacholine-induced bronchoconstriction in sheep. Regional VA/Q ratios were calculated from the imaged kinetics of intravenously injected 13NN-saline bolus, assembled into global VA/Q distributions, and used to estimate gas exchange. During bronchoconstriction, large regions with impaired tracer washout were observed adjacent to regions of normal ventilation. PET-derived VA/Q distributions during bronchoconstriction were consistently bimodal, with areas of low VA/Q receiving a large fraction of Q. The standard deviation of the VA/Q distribution was 38% lower if small-scale (subresolution) heterogeneity (< 2.2 cm3) was ignored. Arterial blood gases predicted from PET data correlated well with measured values for Pa(O2) (r2= 0.91, p < 0.01) and Pa(CO2) (r2= 0.90, p < 0.01). We conclude that the bimodality of VA/Q distributions in bronchoconstriction reflects the involvement of large contiguous regions of hypoventilation with substantial subresolution intraregional VA/Q heterogeneity. Assessment of the subresolution VA/Q heterogeneity is therefore essential to accurately quantify global gas exchange impairment during bronchoconstriction.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15640360/
"A cross-sectional comparison of brain glucose and ketone metabolism in cognitively healthy older adults, mild cognitive impairment and early Alzheimer's disease","E Croteau, C A Castellano, M Fortier, C Bocti, T Fulop, N Paquet, S C Cunnane","Introduction: Deteriorating brain glucose metabolism precedes the clinical onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and appears to contribute to its etiology. Ketone bodies, mainly β-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate, are the primary alternative brain fuel to glucose. Some reports suggest that brain ketone metabolism is unchanged in AD but, to our knowledge, no such data are available for MCI.

Objective: To compare brain energy metabolism (glucose and acetoacetate) and some brain morphological characteristics in cognitively healthy older adult controls (CTL), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early AD.

Methods: 24 CTL, 20 MCI and 19AD of similar age and metabolic phenotype underwent a dual-tracer PET and MRI protocol. The uptake rate constants and cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (KGlu, CMRGlu) and acetoacetate (KAcAc, CMRAcAc) were evaluated with PET using [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]-FDG), a glucose analogue, and [11C]-acetoacetate ([11C]-AcAc), a ketone PET tracer. Regional brain volume and cortical thickness were evaluated by T1-weighted MRI.

Results: In AD compared to CTL, CMRGluwas ~11% lower in the frontal, parietal, temporal lobes and in the cingulate gyrus (p<0.05). KGluwas ~15% lower in these same regions and also in subcortical regions. In MCI compared to CTL, ~7% glucose hypometabolism was present in the cingulate gyrus. Neither regional nor whole brain CMRAcAcor KAcAcwere significantly different between CTL and MCI or AD. Reduced gray matter volume and cortical thinning were widespread in AD compared to CTL, whereas, in MCI compared to CTL, volumes were reduced only in the temporal cortex and cortical thinning was most apparent in temporal and cingulate regions.

Discussion: This quantitative kinetic PET and MRI imaging protocol for brain glucose and acetoacetate metabolism confirms that the brain undergoes structural atrophy and lower brain energy metabolism in MCI and AD and demonstrates that the deterioration in brain energy metabolism is specific to glucose. These results suggest that a ketogenic intervention to increase energy availability for the brain is warranted in an attempt to delay further cognitive decline by compensating for the brain glucose deficit in MCI and AD.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28709938/
The lumped constant for the galactose analog 2-18F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-galactose is increased in patients with parenchymal liver disease,"Kasper S Mikkelsen, Michael Sørensen, Kim Frisch, Gerda E Villadsen, Bo M Bibby, Susanne Keiding","The galactose analog 2-(18)F-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-galactose ((18)F-FDGal) is a suitable PET tracer for measuring hepatic galactokinase capacity in vivo, which provides estimates of hepatic metabolic function. As a result of a higher affinity of galactokinase toward galactose, the lumped constant (LC) for (18)F-FDGal was 0.13 in healthy subjects. The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis of a significantly different LC for (18)F-FDGal in patients with parenchymal liver disease.

Methods: Nine patients with liver cirrhosis were studied in connection with a previous study with determination of hepatic intrinsic clearance of ¹⁸F-FDGal (V*(max/K*(m)). The present study determined the hepatic removal kinetics of galactose, including hepatic intrinsic clearance of galactose (V(max)/K(m)) from measurements of hepatic blood flow and arterial and liver vein blood galactose concentrations at increasing galactose infusions. LC for ¹⁸F-FDGal was calculated as (V*(max)/K*(m))/(V(max)/K(m)). On a second day, a dynamic ¹⁸-FDGal PET study with simultaneous infusion of galactose (mean arterial galactose concentration, 6.1 mmol/L of blood) and blood samples from a radial artery was performed, with determination of hepatic systemic clearance of ¹⁸F-FDGal (K*(+gal) from linear analysis of data (Gjedde-Patlak method). The maximum hepatic removal rate of galactose was estimated from ¹⁸F-FDGal PET data (V(max)(PET)) using the estimated LC.

Results: The mean hepatic V(max) of galactose was 1.18 mmol/min, the mean K(m) was 0.91 mmol/L of blood and the mean V(max)/K(m) was 1.18 L of blood/min. When compared with values of healthy subjects, K(m) did not differ (P = 0.77), whereas both V(max) and V(max)/K(m) were significantly lower in patients (both P < 0.01). Mean LC for ¹⁸LF-FDGal was 0.24, which was significantly higher than the mean LC of 0.13 in healthy subjects (P < 0.0001). Mean K*(+gal) determined from the PET study was 0.019 L of blood/min/L of liver tissue, which was not significantly different from that in healthy subjects (P = 0.85). Mean hepatic V(max)(PET) was 0.57 mmol/min/L of liver tissue, which was significantly lower than the value in healthy subjects (1.41 mmol/min/L of liver tissue (P < 0.0001).

Conclusion: Disease may change the LC for a pet tracer, and this study demonstrated the importance of using the correct LC.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24591487/
Feasibility and dosimetry studies for 18F-NOS as a potential PET radiopharmaceutical for inducible nitric oxide synthase in humans,"Pilar Herrero, Richard Laforest, Kooresh Shoghi, Dong Zhou, Gregory Ewald, John Pfeifer, Eric Duncavage, Kitty Krupp, Robert Mach, Robert Gropler","Nitric oxide (NO), the end product of the inducible form of NO synthase (iNOS), is an important mediator of a variety of inflammatory diseases. Therefore, a radiolabeled iNOS radiopharmaceutical for assessing iNOS protein concentration as a marker for its activity would be of value to the study and treatment of NO-related diseases. We recently synthesized an (18)F-radiolabeled analog of the reversible NOS inhibitor, 2-amino-4-methylpyridine ((18)F-NOS), and confirmed its utility in a murine model of lung inflammation. To determine its potential for use in humans, we measured (18)F-NOS myocardial activity in patients after orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT) and correlated it with pathologic allograft rejection, tissue iNOS levels, and calculated human radiation dosimetry.

Methods: Two groups were studied-a kinetic analysis group and a dosimetry group. In the kinetic analysis group, 10 OHT patients underwent dynamic myocardial (18)F-NOS PET/CT, followed by endomyocardial biopsy. Myocardial (18)F-NOS PET was assessed using volume of distribution; standardized uptake values at 10 min; area under the myocardial moment curve (AUMC); and mean resident time at 5, 10, and 30 min after tracer injection. Tissue iNOS levels were measured by immunohistochemistry. In the dosimetry group, the biodistribution and radiation dosimetry were calculated using whole-body PET/CT in 4 healthy volunteers and 12 OHT patients. The combined time-activity curves were used for residence time calculation, and organ doses were calculated with OLINDA.

Results: Both AUMC at 10 min (P < 0.05) and tissue iNOS (P < 0.0001) were higher in patients exhibiting rejection than in those without rejection. Moreover, the (18)F-NOS AUMC at 10 min correlated positively with tissue iNOS at 10 min (R(2) = 0.42, P < 0.05). (18)F-NOS activity was cleared by the hepatobiliary system. The critical organ was the bladder wall, with a dose of 95.3 μGy/MBq, and an effective dose of 15.9 μSv/MBq was calculated.

Conclusion: Myocardial (18)F-NOS activity is increased in organ rejection (a condition associated with increased iNOS levels) and correlates with tissue iNOS measurements with acceptable radiation exposure. Although further modifications to improve the performance of (18)F-NOS are needed, these data show the feasibility of PET of iNOS in the heart and other tissues.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22582045/
Use of cis-[18F]fluoro-proline for assessment of exercise-related collagen synthesis in musculoskeletal connective tissue,"Dorthe Skovgaard, Andreas Kjaer, Katja Maria Heinemeier, Malene Brandt-Larsen, Jacob Madsen, Michael Kjaer","Protein turnover in collagen rich tissue is influenced by exercise, but can only with difficulty be studied in vivo due to use of invasive procedure. The present study was done to investigate the possibility of applying the PET-tracer, cis-[(18)F]fluoro-proline (cis-Fpro), for non-invasive assessment of collagen synthesis in rat musculoskeletal tissues at rest and following short-term (3 days) treadmill running. Musculoskeletal collagen synthesis was studied in rats at rest and 24 h post-exercise. At each session, rats were PET scanned at two time points following injection of cis-FPro: (60 and 240 min p.i). SUV were calculated for Achilles tendon, calf muscle and tibial bone. The PET-derived results were compared to mRNA expression of collagen type I and III. Tibial bone had the highest SUV that increased significantly (p<0.001) from the early (60 min) to the late (240 min) PET scan, while SUV in tendon and muscle decreased (p<0.001). Exercise had no influence on SUV, which was contradicted by an increased gene expression of collagen type I and III in muscle and tendon. The clearly, visible uptake of cis-Fpro in the collagen-rich musculoskeletal tissues is promising for multi-tissue studies in vivo. The tissue-specific differences with the highest basal uptake in bone are in accordance with earlier studies relying on tissue incorporation of isotopic-labelled proline. A possible explanation of the failure to demonstrate enhanced collagen synthesis following exercise, despite augmented collagen type I and III transcription, is that SUV calculations are not sensitive enough to detect minor changes in collagen synthesis. Further studies including kinetic compartment modeling must be performed to establish whether cis-Fpro can be used for non-invasive in-vivo assessment of exercise-induced changes in musculoskeletal collagen synthesis.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21347251/
Clinical indications for Gallium-68 positron emission tomography imaging,"M U Khan, S Khan, S El-Refaie, Z Win, D Rubello, A Al-Nahhas","Background: (68)Ga-PET imaging is showing slow but steady progress when compared to (18)F-FDG PET. The advantage of in-house preparation of (68)Ga without necessity of a cyclotron, and the new generator configuration with future possibility of freeze-dried kits would make it a promising PET agent for the future.

Methods: An exhaustive literature exploration was performed using the search engines High-Wire Press, Pubmed, Embase and library databases. Recent reviews on the subject and up-to-date studies on the topic were found that described the role of (68)Ga-PET imaging. Clinical experiences, including our own are described.

Results: Recent resurgence in development of peptides labelled with radiometals, for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes, resulted in a new beginning for (68)Ga-PET imaging. Pre-clinical experience employing animal models and investigation of tracer kinetics/tumour uptake measurements using dynamic (68)Ga-PET have provided data regarding identification of Somatostatin receptors subtypes on many tumours. Present published experiences including our own support these and highlight current clinical utility of (68)Ga-PET imaging. (68)Ga-DOTATOC and (68)Ga-DOTANOC are the most prominent radiopharmaceuticals used nowadays.

Conclusion: (68)Ga-PET is employed in the management of neuroendocrine tumours and neural crest tumours (phaeochromocytoma and paraganglioma) with diagnostic and therapeutic implications where it compliments present radiologic and scintigraphic procedures. Diagnosis and radiotherapy treatment planning for meningiomas in pertinent clinical setting is another potential use of (68)Ga-PET. Limited studies have shown its utility in prostate cancer but further studies are contemplated. Therefore, current experience tends to open a new horizon for the clinical utility of (68)Ga-PET imaging in future.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19201567/
18F-labeled bombesin analogs for targeting GRP receptor-expressing prostate cancer,"Xianzhong Zhang, Weibo Cai, Feng Cao, Eduard Schreibmann, Yun Wu, Joseph C Wu, Lei Xing, Xiaoyuan Chen","The gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR) is found to be overexpressed in a variety of human tumors. The aim of this study was to develop 18F-labeled bombesin analogs for PET of GRPR expression in prostate cancer xenograft models.

Methods: [Lys3]Bombesin ([Lys3]BBN) and aminocaproic acid-bombesin(7-14) (Aca-BBN(7-14)) were labeled with 18F by coupling the Lys3 amino group and Aca amino group, respectively, with N-succinimidyl-4-18F-fluorobenzoate (18F-SFB) under slightly basic condition (pH 8.5). Receptor-binding affinity of FB-[Lys3]BBN and FB-Aca-BBN(7-14) was tested in PC-3 human prostate carcinoma cells. Internalization and efflux of both radiotracers were also evaluated. Tumor-targeting efficacy and in vivo kinetics of both radiotracers were examined in male athymic nude mice bearing subcutaneous PC-3 tumors by means of biodistribution and dynamic microPET imaging studies. 18F-FB-[Lys3]BBN was also tested for orthotopic PC-3 tumor delineation. Metabolic stability of 18F-FB-[Lys3]BBN was determined in mouse blood, urine, liver, kidney, and tumor homogenates at 1 h after injection.

Results: The typical decay-corrected radiochemical yield was about 30%-40% for both tracers, with a total reaction time of 150 +/- 20 min starting from 18F-. 18F-FB-[Lys3]BBN had moderate stability in the blood and PC-3 tumor, whereas it was degraded rapidly in the liver, kidneys, and urine. Both radiotracers exhibited rapid blood clearance. 18F-FB-[Lys3]BBN had predominant renal excretion. 18F-FB-Aca-BBN(7-14) exhibited both hepatobiliary and renal clearance. Dynamic microPET imaging studies revealed that the PC-3 tumor uptake of 18F-FB-[Lys3]BBN in PC-3 tumor was much higher than that of 18F-FB-Aca-BBN(7-14) at all time points examined (P < 0.01). The receptor specificity of 18F-FB-[Lys3]BBN in vivo was demonstrated by effective blocking of tumor uptake in the presence of [Tyr4]BBN. No obvious blockade was found in PC-3 tumor when 18F-FB-Aca-BBN(7-14) was used as radiotracer under the same condition. 18F-FB-[Lys3]BBN was also able to visualize orthotopic PC-3 tumor at early time points after tracer administration, at which time minimal urinary bladder activity was present to interfere with the receptor-mediated tumor uptake.

Conclusion: This study demonstrates that 18F-FB-[Lys3]BBN and PET are suitable for detecting GRPR-positive prostate cancer in vivo.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16513619/
Coronary Microvascular Dysfunction: Clinical Considerations and Noninvasive Diagnosis,"Thomas H Schindler, Vasken Dilsizian","Chest pain in patients without obstructive coronary artery disease has been realized as a frequent problem encountered in clinical practice. Invasive flow investigations have suggested that up to two-thirds of patients with nonobstructive coronary atherosclerosis may have microvascular dysfunction (MVD). Positron emission tomography myocardial perfusion imaging in conjunction with tracer-kinetic modeling enables the concurrent quantification of myocardial blood flow (MBF) in milliliters per minute per gram of tissue. This allows the assessment of hyperemic MBFs and myocardial flow reserve for the noninvasive identification and characterization of MVD as an important functional substrate for angina symptoms amenable to intensified and individualized medical intervention with nitrates, calcium-channel blockers, statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and/or angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers. Recent investigations suggest that cardiac magnetic resonance and computed tomography may also be suitable for the noninvasive detection of MVD. Whether intensified and individualized treatment related improvement or even normalization of hyperemic MBF and/or myocardial flow reserve may lead to a persistent reduction in angina symptoms and/or improved cardiovascular outcome as compared to standard care, deserves further testing in large-scale randomized clinical trials.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30982670/
Flexible numerical simulation framework for dynamic PET-MR data,"Johannes Mayer, Richard Brown, Kris Thielemans, Evgueni Ovtchinnikov, Edoardo Pasca, David Atkinson, Ashley Gillman, Paul Marsden, Matteo Ippoliti, Marcus Makowski, Tobias Schaeffter, Christoph Kolbitsch","This paper presents a simulation framework for dynamic PET-MR. The main focus of this framework is to provide motion-resolved MR and PET data and ground truth motion information. This can be used in the optimisation and quantitative evaluation of image registration and in assessing the error propagation due to inaccuracies in motion estimation in complex motion-compensated reconstruction algorithms. Contrast and tracer kinetics can also be simulated and are available as ground truth information. To closely emulate medical examination, input and output of the simulation are files in standardised open-source raw data formats. This enables the use of existing raw data as a template input and ensures seamless integration of the output into existing reconstruction pipelines. The proposed framework was validated in PET-MR and image registration applications. It was used to simulate a FDG-PET-MR scan with cardiac and respiratory motion. Ground truth motion information could be utilised to optimise parameters for PET and synergistic PET-MR image registration. In addition, a free-breathing dynamic contrast enhancement (DCE) abdominal scan of a patient with hepatic lesions was simulated. In order to correct for breathing motion, a motion-corrected image reconstruction scheme was used and a Toft's model was fit to the DCE data to obtain quantitative DCE-MRI parameters. Utilising the ground truth motion information, the dependency of quantitative DCE-MR images on the accuracy of the motion estimation was evaluated. We demonstrated that respiratory motion had to be available with an average accuracy of at least the spatial resolution of the DCE-MR images in order to ensure an improvement in lesions visualisation and quantification compared to no motion correction. The proposed framework provides a valuable tool with a wide range of scientific PET and MR applications and will be available as part of the open-source project Synergistic Image Reconstruction Framework (SIRF).",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32692725/
Coronary microvascular reactivity to sympathetic stimulation in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy,"A E Drzezga, R Blasini, S I Ziegler, F M Bengel, W Picker, M Schwaiger","The objective of this study was to assess noninvasively the microvascular reactivity to sympathetic stimulation in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC) and in healthy volunteers, who underwent cardiac catheterization for exclusion of coronary artery disease.

Methods: Myocardial flow was quantified with 13N-ammonia PET and tracer kinetic modeling at rest and in response to cold pressor testing (CPT). Ten healthy volunteers (8 men, 2 women; mean age +/- SD, 50.7 +/- 15 y) and 10 matched patients (8 men, 2 women; mean age, 52.5 +/- 14 y) with IDC (mean left ventricular ejection fraction, 0.30 +/- 0.12) were included in the study.

Results: Myocardial perfusion at rest was not significantly different between the groups. However, myocardial vascular resistance (MVR) was significantly lower in IDC patients at rest than in healthy volunteers. In response to CPT a significant decrease in MVR was found in healthy volunteers (1.9 +/- 0.4 to 1.5 +/- 0.4 mm Hg x 100 g/mL; 22% decrease) but not in IDC patients (1.5 +/- 0.4 to 1.4 +/- 0.3 mm Hg x 100 g/mL; 9% decrease). Consequently, the increase of the myocardial blood flow in response to CPT was significantly lower (P < 0.008) in IDC patients (56 +/- 17 to 66 +/- 18 mL/100g/min; 20% increase) compared with healthy volunteers (52 +/- 12 to 80 +/- 30 mL/100 g/min; 52% increase), whereas both showed comparable hemodynamic reactions.

Conclusion: The data indicate that CPT in combination with 13N PET imaging is a valuable noninvasive tool for assessment of coronary microvascular reaction to sympathetic stimulation in IDC patients. Lower coronary vascular resistance was found in IDC patients at rest compared with healthy volunteers, suggesting possible exhaustion of sympathetically induced dilation of the coronary microvasculature in IDC patients at rest. This mechanism may explain the impaired flow response to cold in IDC patients in the present study.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10809200/
2-(2-Nitro-1 H-imidazol-1-yl)ethyl 2-[18F]fluoroacetate,Kam Leung,"Hypoxia is found in a variety of solid tumors and leads to tumor progression and the resistance of tumors to chemotherapy and radiotherapy (1-3). Tumor oxygenation is heterogeneously distributed within human tumors (4). It would be beneficial to assess tumor oxygenation before and after therapy to provide an evaluation of tumor response to treatment and an insight into new therapeutic treatments (5). Tumor oxygenation is measured invasively using computerized, polarographic, oxygen-sensitive electrodes, which is regarded as the gold standard (6). Functional and non-invasive imaging of intratumoral hypoxia has been demonstrated to be feasible for the measurement of tumor oxygenation (7).

Chapman proposed the use of 2-nitroimidazoles for hypoxia imaging in 1979 (8). 2-Nitroimidazole compounds are postulated to undergo a reduction in hypoxic conditions, forming highly reactive oxygen radicals that subsequently bind covalently to macromolecules inside the cells (9). In normoxic conditions, the reduced molecule is rapidly reoxidized and transported from the cell. [18F]Fluoromisonidazole () is the most widely used positron emission tomography (PET) tracer for imaging tumor hypoxia (7). However, it has slow clearance kinetics and high lipophilicity, resulting in substantial background signal in PET scans. [18F]Fluoroazomycinarabinofuranoside () is a 2-nitroimidazole with a sugar addition (10) and has been studied as a hypoxia-imaging agent, showing promising results in various tumor models in rats and mice (11, 12). Zha et al. (13) reported a new [18F]-labeled 2-nitroimidazole derivative, 2-(2-nitro-1H-imidazol-1-yl)ethyl 2-[18F]fluoroacetate ([18F]NEFT, which contains a hydrolyzable ester group forin vivohypoxic tissue imaging.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22013606/
Late Imaging with [1-(11)C]Acetate Improves Detection of Tumor Fatty Acid Synthesis with PET,"David Y Lewis, Joan Boren, Greg L Shaw, Robert Bielik, Antonio Ramos-Montoya, Timothy J Larkin, Carla P Martins, David E Neal, Dmitry Soloviev, Kevin M Brindle","Tumors are often characterized by high levels of de novo fatty acid synthesis. The kinetics of acetate incorporation into tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates and into lipids suggest that detection of tumors with [1-(11)C]acetate PET could be improved by imaging at later time points.

Methods: The uptake and metabolism of [1-(11)C], [1-(13)C], and [1-(14)C]acetate were measured in mouse prostate and lung cancer models to investigate the time course of (11)C label incorporation into tumor metabolites.

Results: Radioactivity in the lipid fraction, as compared with the aqueous fraction, in extracts of C4-2B human prostate xenografts peaked at 90 min after [1-(14)C]acetate injection, which coincided with peak (13)C label incorporation into the fatty acids palmitate and stearate. Contrast between the tumor and tissues, such as blood and muscle, increased in PET images acquired over a period of 120 min after [1-(11)C]acetate injection, and Patlak plots were linear from 17.5 min after injection. Similar results were obtained in a genetically engineered K-ras(G12D); p53(null) lung cancer model, in which the mean tumor-to-lung ratio at 90 min after [1-(14)C]acetate injection was 4.4-fold higher than at 15 min.

Conclusion: These findings suggest that when imaging de novo fatty acid synthesis with [1-(11)C]acetate it is preferable to measure uptake at later time points, when the effects of perfusion and (11)C incorporation into tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates and bicarbonate are declining. The data presented here suggest that future clinical PET scans of tumors should be acquired later than 30 min, when tracer accumulation due to de novo fatty acid synthesis prevails.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24777291/
"A dual inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases and a disintegrin and metalloproteinases, [¹⁸F]FB-ML5, as a molecular probe for non-invasive MMP/ADAM-targeted imaging","Nathalie Matusiak, Riccardo Castelli, Adriaan W Tuin, Herman S Overkleeft, Rosalina Wisastra, Frank J Dekker, Laurette M Prély, Rainer Bischoff, Aren van Waarde, Rudi A J O Dierckx, Philip H Elsinga","Background: Numerous clinical studies have shown a correlation between increased matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)/a disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM) activity and poor outcome of cancer. Various MMP inhibitors (MMPIs) have been developed for therapeutic purposes in oncology. In addition, molecular imaging of MMP/ADAM levels in vivo would allow the diagnosis of tumors. We selected the dual inhibitor of MMPs and ADAMs, ML5, which is a hydroxamate-based inhibitor with affinities for many MMPs and ADAMs. ML5 was radiolabelled with (18)F and the newly obtained radiolabelled inhibitor was evaluated in vitro and in vivo.

Materials and methods: ML5 was radiolabelled by direct acylation with N-succinimidyl-4-[(18)F]fluorobenzoate ([(18)F]SFB) for PET (positron emission tomography). The resulting radiotracer [(18)F]FB-ML5 was evaluated in vitro in human bronchial epithelium 16HBE cells and breast cancer MCF-7 cells. The non-radioactive probe FB-ML5 and native ML5 were tested in a fluorogenic inhibition assay against MMP-2, -9, -12 and ADAM-17. The in vivo kinetics of [(18)F]FB-ML5 were examined in a HT1080 tumor-bearing mouse model. Specificity of probe binding was examined by co-injection of 0 or 2.5mg/kg ML5.

Results: ML5 and FB-ML5 showed high affinity for MMP-2, -9, -12 and ADAM-17; indeed IC50 values were respectively 7.4 ± 2.0, 19.5 ± 2.8, 2.0 ± 0.2 and 5.7 ± 2.2 nM and 12.5 ± 3.1, 31.5 ± 13.7, 138.0 ± 10.9 and 24.7 ± 2.8 nM. Radiochemical yield of HPLC-purified [(18)F]FB-ML5 was 13-16% (corrected for decay). Cellular binding of [(18)F]FB-ML5 was reduced by 36.6% and 27.5% in MCF-7 and 16 HBE cells, respectively, after co-incubation with 10 μM of ML5. In microPET scans, HT1080 tumors exhibited a low and homogeneous uptake of the tracer. Tumors of mice injected with [(18)F]FB-ML5 showed a SUVmean of 0.145 ± 0.064 (n=6) which decreased to 0.041 ± 0.027 (n=6) after target blocking (p<0.05). Ex vivo biodistribution showed a rapid excretion through the kidneys and the liver. Metabolite assays indicated that the parent tracer represented 23.2 ± 7.3% (n=2) of total radioactivity in plasma, at 90 min post injection (p.i.).

Conclusion: The nanomolar affinity MMP/ADAM inhibitor ML5 was successfully labelled with (18)F. [(18)F]FB-ML5 demonstrated rather low binding in ADAM-17 overexpressing cell lines. [(18)F]FB-ML5 uptake showed significant reduction in the HT1080 tumor in vivo after co-injection of ML5. [(18)F]FB-ML5 may be suitable for the visualization/quantification of diseases overexpressing simultaneously MMPs and ADAMs.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25438884/
In vivo vulnerability to competition by endogenous dopamine: comparison of the D2 receptor agonist radiotracer (-)-N-[11C]propyl-norapomorphine ([11C]NPA) with the D2 receptor antagonist radiotracer [11C]-raclopride,"Rajesh Narendran, Dah-Ren Hwang, Mark Slifstein, Peter S Talbot, David Erritzoe, Yiyun Huang, Thomas B Cooper, Diana Martinez, Lawrence S Kegeles, Anissa Abi-Dargham, Marc Laruelle","(-)-N-Propyl-norapomorphine (NPA) is a full dopamine (DA) D2 receptor agonist and [11C]NPA is a suitable radiotracer to image D2 receptors configured in a state of high affinity for agonists with positron emission tomography (PET). In this study the vulnerability of the in vivo binding of [11C]NPA to acute fluctuation in synaptic DA was assessed with PET in baboons and compared to that of the reference D2 receptor antagonist radiotracer [11C]raclopride. Three male baboons were studied with [11C]raclopride and [11C]NPA under baseline conditions and following administration of the potent DA releaser amphetamine (0.3, 0.5, and 1.0 mg kg(-1) i.v.). Kinetic modeling with an arterial input function was used to derive the striatal specific-to-nonspecific equilibrium partition coefficient (V3""). [11C]Raclopride V3"" was reduced by 24 +/- 10%, 32 +/- 6%, and 44 +/- 9% following amphetamine doses of 0.3, 0.5, and 1.0 mg kg(-1), respectively. [11C]NPA V3"" was reduced by 32 +/- 2%, 45 +/- 3%, and 53 +/- 9% following amphetamine doses of 0.3, 0.5, and 1.0 mg kg(-1), respectively. Thus, endogenous DA was more effective at competing with [11C]NPA binding compared to [11C]raclopride binding, a finding consistent with the pharmacology of these tracers (agonist vs. antagonist). These results also suggest that 71% of D2 receptors are configured in a state of high affinity for agonists in vivo. In conclusion, [11C]NPA might provide a superior radiotracer to probe presynaptic DA function with PET in health and disease.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15065219/
Respiratory phase alignment improves blood-flow quantification in Rb82 PET myocardial perfusion imaging,"Amir Pourmoghaddas, Ran Klein, Robert A deKemp, R Glenn Wells","Purpose: Positron emission tomography (PET) is considered the gold standard for measuring myocardial blood flow in vivo but it is known that respiratory motion can lead to misalignment of the PET and computed tomography (CT) data sets and introduce artifacts in the CT-based attenuation correction (AC) of images. In addition, respiratory motion blurs the PET image and degrades spatial resolution. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the combined effect of respiratory motion compensation (MC) and accurate attenuation correction on relative and absolute blood flow imaging of the heart.

Methods: Dynamic (82)Rb-PET acquisitions were generated for a homogeneous tracer distribution in the heart using an anthropomorphic computer phantom and a Monte Carlo simulator. Attenuation correction was done using three different approaches in which the PET data were corrected by: (1) a respiratory-gated CT map with each respiratory phase of the PET scan corrected by its corresponding CT phase (matched); (2) a time-averaged attenuation map (avg); or (3) an attenuation map generated from the maximum CT-number of every voxel over the respiratory cycle (max). Motion compensated was done using an automated rigid-body registration algorithm that aligned all of the phases of the respiratory-gated PET data after AC. The corrected dynamic PET data were then processed by inhouse kinetic analysis software to generate 3D maps of blood flow. Polar maps of the blood-flow for each CT-AC method with and without MC were compared to the truth using a 17-segment model. The same comparison was performed on data from a pig study.

Results: Motion compensation significantly reduced the segmental mean percentage error (sMPE) in all cases (p < 0.01 for matched CTAC and avg CTAC and p = 0.03 for max CTAC). MC significantly increased image uniformity in the case of matched and avg CTAC (p < 0.01, p = 0.04, respectively) with the best improvement coming for matched CTAC. Without MC, there were no significant differences between the three CTAC approaches. With MC, matched CTAC had significantly smaller mean absolute sMPE (p < 0.01 vs avg CTAC; p < 0.01 vs max CTAC) and improved uniformity (p = 0.05 vs avg CTAC; p < 0.01 vs max CTAC). The results were supported with a pig study.

Conclusions: Without MC, there was no significant difference between the three CTAC methods for measuring blood flow. With MC, the matched CTAC approach was significantly better, reducing the mean difference from truth by 6% in the simulated data and improving uniformity by 5%.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23387770/
"Regional blood flow, oxidative metabolism, and glucose utilization in patients with recent myocardial infarction","J Czernin, G Porenta, R Brunken, J Krivokapich, K Chen, R Bennett, A Hage, C Fung, J Tillisch, M E Phelps","Background: Metabolic imaging with positron emission tomography (PET) can detect tissue viability in clinical infarct regions. With appropriate tracer kinetic models and serial PET imaging, regional myocardial blood flow and rates of metabolism can now be quantified in patients with recent myocardial infarctions.

Methods and results: Serial PET imaging with [13N]ammonia, [11C]acetate, and 18F-deoxyglucose was performed in 22 patients with recent infarctions to measure regional blood flow (in milliliters per gram per minute), glucose metabolism (in micromoles per gram per minute), and oxidative metabolism (in clearance rate per minute). Hypoperfused clinical infarct regions were classified as ""PET mismatch"" if 18F was increased relative to 13N activity or ""PET match"" if 13N and 18F activities were reduced concordantly. Blood flows differed significantly between normal, mismatch, and match segments (0.83 +/- 0.20, 0.57 +/- 0.20, and 0.32 +/- 0.12 mL.g-1.min-1, respectively). The relation between oxidative metabolism and blood flow was piecewise linear and differed significantly between PET mismatch and PET match. Oxidative metabolism was less severely reduced than blood flow in mismatch regions but but reduced in proportion to blood flow in match regions. There was considerable overlap of blood flows between both types of PET segments.

Conclusions: Quantification of regional blood flow and substrate metabolism in postinfarction patients revealed alterations in the relation between substrate delivery and consumption demonstrated previously only in invasive animal experiments. The preserved oxidative metabolism in myocardium with PET mismatches may be ascribed to a regional increase in oxygen extraction. Such increase together with preserved glucose utilization may be the prerequisite for survival of ischemically injured myocardium.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8353915/
[18F]Fluciclatide PET as a biomarker of response to combination therapy of pazopanib and paclitaxel in platinum-resistant/refractory ovarian cancer,"Rohini Sharma, Pablo Oriol Valls, Marianna Inglese, Suraiya Dubash, Michelle Chen, Hani Gabra, Ana Montes, Amarnath Challapalli, Mubarik Arshad, George Tharakan, Ed Chambers, Tom Cole, Jingky P Lozano-Kuehne, Tara D Barwick, Eric O Aboagye","Background: Angiogenesis is a driver of platinum resistance in ovarian cancer. We assessed the effect of combination pazopanib and paclitaxel followed by maintenance pazopanib in patients with platinum-resistant/refractory ovarian cancer. Integrins αvβ3and αvβ5are both upregulated in tumor-associated vasculature. [18F]Fluciclatide is a novel PET tracer that has high affinity for integrins αvβ3/5, and was used to assess the anti-angiogenic effect of pazopanib.

Patients and methods: We conducted an open-label, phase Ib study in patients with platinum-resistant/refractory ovarian cancer. Patients received 1 week of single-agent pazopanib (800 mg daily) followed by combination therapy with weekly paclitaxel (80 mg/m2). Following completion of 18 weeks of combination therapy, patients continued with single-agent pazopanib until disease progression. Dynamic [18F]fluciclatide-PET imaging was conducted at baseline and after 1 week of pazopanib. Response (RECIST 1.1), toxicities, and survival outcomes were recorded. Circulating markers of angiogenesis were assessed with therapy.

Results: Fourteen patients were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. Complete and partial responses were seen in seven patients (54%). Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 10.63 months, and overall survival (OS) was 18.5 months. Baseline [18F]fluciclatide uptake was predictive of long PFS. Elevated baseline circulating angiopoietin and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) were predictive of greater reduction in SUV60,meanfollowing pazopanib. Kinetic modeling of PET data indicated a reduction in K1and Kifollowing pazopanib indicating reduced radioligand delivery and retention.

Conclusions: Combination therapy followed by maintenance pazopanib is effective and tolerable in platinum-resistant/refractory ovarian cancer. [18F]Fluciclatide-PET uptake parameters predict clinical outcome with pazopanib therapy indicating an anti-angiogenic response.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31754793/
"Assessment of test-retest reproducibility of [18F]SynVesT-1, a novel radiotracer for PET imaging of synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A","Songye Li, Mika Naganawa, Richard Pracitto, Soheila Najafzadeh, Daniel Holden, Shannan Henry, David Matuskey, Paul R Emery, Zhengxin Cai, Jim Ropchan, Nabeel Nabulsi, Richard E Carson, Yiyun Huang","Purpose: Synaptic abnormalities are associated with many brain disorders. Recently, we developed a novel synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A) radiotracer [18F]SynVesT-1 and demonstrated its excellent imaging and binding properties in nonhuman primates. The aim of this study was to perform dosimetry calculations in nonhuman primates and to evaluate this tracer in humans and assess its test-retest reliability in comparison with [11C]UCB-J.

Methods: Three rhesus monkeys underwent whole body dynamic PET scanning to estimate the absorbed dose. PET scans in six healthy human subjects were acquired. Time-activity curves (TACs) were generated with defined regions of interest (ROI). Reproducibility of distribution volume (VT) values and its sensitivity to scan duration were assessed with the one-tissue compartment (1TC) model. Non-displaceable binding potential (BPND) was calculated using centrum semiovale as the reference region.

Results: The dosimetry study showed high uptake in the urinary bladder and brain. In humans, [18F]SynVesT-1 displayed high uptake with maximum SUV of ~10 and appropriate kinetics with a quick rise in tracer uptake followed by a gradual clearance. Mean 1TC VTvalues (mL/cm3) ranged from 3.4 (centrum semiovale) to 19.6 (putamen) and were similar to those of [11C]UCB-J. Regional BPNDvalues were 2.7-4.7 in gray matter areas, and mean BPNDvalues across all ROIs were ~ 21% higher than those of [11C]UCB-J. The absolute test-retest variability of VTand BPNDwas excellent (< 9%) across all brain regions.

Conclusions: [18F]SynVesT-1 demonstrates outstanding characteristics in humans: fast and high brain uptake, appropriate tissue kinetics, high levels of specific binding, and excellent test-retest reproducibility of binding parameters. As such, [18F]SynVesT-1 is proved to be a favorable radiotracer for SV2A imaging and quantification in humans.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33416954/
Optimizing experimental protocols for quantitative behavioral imaging with 18F-FDG in rodents,"Wynne K Schiffer, Martine M Mirrione, Stephen L Dewey","Small-animal PET provides the opportunity to image brain activation during behavioral tasks in animal models of human conditions. The present studies aimed to simplify behavioral imaging procedures without a loss of quantitation by using an intraperitoneal route of administration (no cannulation, no anesthesia) and using a standardized uptake value (SUV) to reduce scan duration.

Methods: Sixteen animals with carotid artery cannulations were studied with 18F-FDG small-animal PET accompanied by serial arterial blood sampling. Ten of these animals were anesthetized and were inside the tomograph during 18F-FDG uptake, whereas 6 animals were awake in their home cages and scanned after 60 min of uptake. Of the 10 anesthetized animals, 6 received intraperitoneal 18F-FDG, whereas 4 received intravenous 18F-FDG, and all 6 awake animals received intraperitoneal 18F-FDG. Intravenously injected animals were positioned far enough inside the tomograph to obtain region-of-interest-based measures from the heart and the brain. In all animals, a full arterial input function and plasma glucose levels were obtained. To establish the optimal time during 18F-FDG uptake for blood sampling when using an SUV, a Patlak kinetic model was used to derive absolute rates of glucose metabolism and compared with SUVs calculated using different plasma points from the arterial input function.

Results: A single plasma point taken at 60 min after injection for intraperitoneal injections or 45 min after injection for intravenous injections provides a sensitive index of glucose metabolic rate with the highest correlation with data obtained from a fully quantitative input function.

Conclusion: These studies support an experimental protocol in which animals can receive the 18F-FDG tracer injection intraperitoneally, away from the small-animal tomograph and with minimal impact on behavior. Further, animals can occupy the tomograph bed for a 10- to 30-min scan with a consequent increase in animal throughput.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17268026/
Evaluation of D-isomer of 18F-FBPA for oncology PET focusing on the differentiation of glioma and inflammation,"Nobuto Hirai, Tadashi Watabe, Shushi Nagamori, Pattama Wiriyasermkul, Yoko Tanaka, Victor Romanov, Sadahiro Naka, Yasukazu Kanai, Yuwei Liu, Naoki Tani, Tatsuya Sakai, Mitsuaki Tatsumi, Eku Shimosegawa, Yoshikatsu Kanai, Jun Hatazawa","Objectives: L-4-borono-2-18F-fluoro-phenylalanine (L-[18F]FBPA), a substrate of L-type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1), is a tumor-specific probe used in positron emission tomography (PET). On the other hand, it has not been examined whether another isomer D-[18F]FBPA accumulates specifically in the tumor. Here, we compared the accumulation of D-[18F]FBPA in C6 glioma and inflammation to evaluate the performance of D-[18F]FBPA as a tumor-specific probe.

Methods: HEK293-LAT1 and HEK293-LAT2 cells were tested for [14C]-leucine or [14C]-alanine transport, and IC50values of L- and D-FBPA were evaluated in both cell types. PET was conducted in rat xenograft model of C6 glioma with LAT1 expression and model of turpentine oil-induced subcutaneous inflammation (n=10 for both models). The concentrations of D-[18F]FBPA were compared between glioma and inflammatory lesion using standardized uptake value (SUV).

Results: In contrast to L-FBPA, which inhibited substrate uptake in both HEK293-LAT1 and -LAT2 cells, D-FBPA showed no inhibitory effect on both cells, suggesting low transporter selectivity of D-[18F]FBPA against LAT1 and LAT2. Static PET analysis showed low accumulation of D-[18F]FBPA in C6 glioma and inflammatory lesion (SUVmax=0.80±0.16, 0.56±0.09, respectively). Although there was a statistical difference in SUVmaxbetween these tissues, it was difficult to distinguish glioma from inflammation on the PET image due to its low uptake level. Therefore, it was suggested that D-[18F]FBPA is not a suitable tumor-specific probe for oncology PET in contrast to L-[18F]FBPA.

Conclusion: This study demonstrated that D-[18F]FBPA is not a LAT1-specific PET probe and shows low uptake in C6 glioma, indicating its unsuitability as a tumor diagnosis PET probe.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32714997/
Gene's expression underpinning the divergent predictive value of [18F]F-fluorodeoxyglucose and prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography in primary prostate cancer: a bioinformatic and experimental study,"Matteo Bauckneht, Cecilia Marini, Vanessa Cossu, Cristina Campi, Mattia Riondato, Silvia Bruno, Anna Maria Orengo, Francesca Vitale, Sonia Carta, Silvia Chiola, Sabrina Chiesa, Alberto Miceli, Francesca D'Amico, Giuseppe Fornarini, Carlo Terrone, Michele Piana, Silvia Morbelli, Alessio Signori, Paola Barboro, Gianmario Sambuceti","Background: Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging with Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA) and Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) represent promising biomarkers for risk-stratification of Prostate Cancer (PCa). We verified whether the expression of genes encoding for PSMA and enzymes regulating FDG cellular uptake are independent and additive prognosticators in PCa.

Methods: mRNA expression of genes involved in glucose metabolism and PSMA regulation obtained from primary PCa specimens were retrieved from open-source databases and analyzed using an integrative bioinformatics approach. Machine Learning (ML) techniques were used to create predictive Progression-Free Survival (PFS) models. Cellular models of primary PCa with different aggressiveness were used to compare [18F]F-PSMA-1007 and [18F]F-FDG uptake kinetics in vitro. Confocal microscopy, immunofluorescence staining, and quantification analyses were performed to assess the intracellular and cellular membrane PSMA expression.

Results: ML analyses identified a predictive functional network involving four glucose metabolism-related genes: ALDOB, CTH, PARP2, and SLC2A4. By contrast, FOLH1 expression (encoding for PSMA) did not provide any additive predictive value to the model. At a cellular level, the increase in proliferation rate and migratory potential by primary PCa cells was associated with enhanced FDG uptake and decreased PSMA retention (paralleled by the preferential intracellular localization).

Conclusions: The overexpression of a functional network involving four glucose metabolism-related genes identifies a higher risk of disease progression since the earliest phases of PCa, in agreement with the acknowledged prognostic value of FDG PET imaging. By contrast, the prognostic value of PSMA PET imaging is independent of the expression of its encoding gene FOLH1. Instead, it is influenced by the protein docking to the cell membrane, regulating its accessibility to tracer binding.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36600265/
Evaluation of [18F]JNJ-CSF1R-1 as a Positron Emission Tomography Ligand Targeting Colony-Stimulating Factor 1 Receptor,"Mani Salarian, Shuanglong Liu, Hsiu-Ming Tsai, Shannon N Leslie, Thomas Hayes, Su-Tang Lo, Anna K Szardenings, Wei Zhang, Gang Chen, Christine Sandiego, Lisa Wells, Dileep G Nair, Hartmuth C Kolb, Chunfang A Xia","Purpose: Colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) signaling plays a pivotal role in neuroinflammation, driving microglia proliferation and activation. CSF1R is considered a hallmark of inflammation in many neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Our study aims to evaluate the potential value of 5-cyano-N-(4-(4-(2-([18F]fluoro)ethyl)piperazin-1-yl)-2-(piperidin-1-yl)phenyl)furan-2-carboxamide ([18F]JNJ-CSF1R-1) as a positron emission tomography (PET) ligand targeting CSF1R in preclinical models of neuroinflammation.

Procedures: A cell-based MSD assay was used to measure the IC50of 5-cyano-N-(4-(4-(2-(fluoro)ethyl)piperazin-1-yl)-2-(piperidin-1-yl)phenyl)furan-2-carboxamide (JNJ-CSF1R-1). JNJ-CSF1R-1 was radiolabeled with fluorine-18. PET imaging was used to evaluate brain uptake, and target engagement of [18F]JNJ-CSF1R-1 in two neuroinflammation mouse models, including systemic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and AppSAAknock in (KI). CSF1R protein levels in brain tissue were determined by western blot and ELISA assays. [18F]JNJ-CSF1R-1 brain uptake was also measured in a non-human primate (NHP) PET study.

Results: JNJ-CSF1R-1 is a 12 nM (IC50) inhibitor of CSF1R. ​[18F]JNJ-CSF1R-1 demonstrated significantly higher brain uptake in both LPS and AD mouse models as measured by the area under the time activity curves (AUC) compared to control animals. In the AppSAAKI model, CSF1R levels increased near amyloid plaques as detected by IHC. ​[18F]JNJ-CSF1R-1 PET imaging signal showed a good correlation with CSF1R expression levels measured by western blot and ELISA. In an NHP study, ​[18F]JNJ-CSF1R-1 readily entered the brain and demonstrated reversible kinetics.

Conclusion: ​[18F]JNJ-CSF1R-1 is a potent and promising CSF1R PET tracer with translational potential for measuring microglia-based neuroinflammatory processes and for tracking the impact of anti-inflammatory therapies.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40009327/
Non-invasive assessment of skeletal kinetics using fluorine-18 fluoride positron emission tomography: evaluation of image and population-derived arterial input functions,"G J Cook, M A Lodge, P K Marsden, A Dynes, I Fogelman","To measure regional skeletal kinetics using fluorine-18 fluoride positron emission tomography (PET) it is necessary to know the concentration of radioactive tracer being delivered to bone by arterial plasma with relation to time, the arterial input function (IFa). Methods by which IFa can be derived without arterial sampling are attractive because of their relative technical simplicity and the reduction in possible morbidity to the subject. We have compared the use of a scaled population input function (IFp) and a corrected image-derived input function from the aorta (IFi) with an IFa directly measured from a radial artery line in ten normal postmenopausal women. Both of the aforementioned methods rely only on a small number of discrete venous samples. Each subject had a dynamic PET acquisition of the lumbar spine performed after the intravenous injection of 180 MBq (18)F-fluoride. Both the IFp and the IFi were compared with the IFa in terms of the accuracy of determination of six parameters. These were: plasma clearance of fluoride to bone mineral (K(i)), unidirectional plasma clearance to total bone tissue (K(1)) and individual rate constants k(2), k(3) and k(4), calculated using non-linear regression with a three-compartment model, and the plasma clearance to bone mineral calculated using the Patlak method (K(pat)). For both the IFp and the IFi method the root mean square errors for K(pat) and K(i) were similar and small (<8.2%). The errors in determining K(1) and the rate constants k(2) to k(4) are larger by either method, but with a small advantage using the IFp method. It is concluded that the use of either non-invasive method for determining the arterial plasma input function is suitable for the measurement of the most important parameters, K(i) and K(pat), in these subjects.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10552083/

Dynamic rest-stress measurements were made using a SPECT camera. Kinetic parameters were calculated using a 1-tissue-compartment model and converted to MBF and MFR. Processing with and without corrections for attenuation (+AC and -AC), patient body motion (+MC and -MC), and binding of the tracer to red blood cells (+BB and -BB) was evaluated.Results:Both +BB and +MC improved the accuracy and precision of global SPECT MBF compared with PET MBF, resulting in an average difference of 0.06 ± 0.37 mL/min/g. Global MBF and detection of abnormal MFR were not significantly improved with +AC. Global SPECT MFR with +MC and +BB had an area under the receiver-operating curve of 0.90 (+AC) to 0.95 (-AC) for detecting abnormal PET MFR less than 2.0. Regional analysis produced similar results with an area under the receiver-operating curve of 0.84 (+AC) to 0.87 (-AC).Conclusion:Solid-state SPECT provides global MBF and MFR measurements that differ from PET by 2% ± 32% (MBF) and 2% ± 28% (MFR).",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28611245/
1-(5-[18F]Fluoro-5-deoxy-α- D-arabinofuranosyl)-2-nitroimidazole,Kam Leung,"Hypoxia was found in a variety of solid tumors, leading to tumor progression and the resistance of tumors to chemotherapy and radiotherapy (1-3). Tumor oxygenation is heterogeneously distributed within human tumors (4). It would be beneficial to assess tumor oxygenation before and after therapy to provide an evaluation of tumor response to treatment and an insight into new therapeutic treatments (5). Tumor oxygenation is measured invasively using computerized polarographic oxygen-sensitive electrodes, which is regarded as the gold standard (6). Functional and non-invasive imaging of intratumoral hypoxia has been demonstrated to be feasible for the measurement of tumor oxygenation (7).

Chapman proposed the use of 2-nitroimidazoles for hypoxia imaging in 1979 (8). 2-Nitroimidazole compounds are postulated to undergo reduction in hypoxic condition, forming highly reactive oxygen radicals that subsequently bind covalently to macromolecules inside the cells (9). [18F]Fluoromisonidazole ([18F]FMISO) is the most widely used positron emission tomography (PE) tracer for imaging tumor hypoxia (7). However, it has slow clearance kinetics and a high lipophilicity, resulting in substantially high background in PET scan. [18F]Fluoroazomycinarabinofuranoside ([18F]FAZA) is a 2-nitroimidazole with a sugar addition (10). [18F]FAZA was studied as hypoxia imaging agent, showing promising results in various tumor models in rats and mice (11, 12).

The in vivo diagnosis is currently established on clinical grounds and supported by midbrain atrophy estimation in structural MRI. Here, we investigate whether18F-PI-2620 tau PET has the potential to improve the imaging diagnosis of PSP.Methods:In this multicenter observational study, dynamic (0-60 min after injection)18F-PI-2620 PET and structural MRI data for 36 patients with PSP, 22 with PSP-Richardson syndrome, and 14 with a clinical phenotype other than Richardson syndrome (i.e., variant PSP) were analyzed along with data for 10 age-matched healthy controls (HCs). The PET data underwent kinetic modeling, which resulted in distribution volume ratio (DVR) images. These and the MR images were visually assessed by 3 masked experts for typical PSP signs. Furthermore, established midbrain atrophy parameters were measured in structural MR images, and regional DVRs were measured in typical tau-in-PSP target regions in the PET data.Results:Visual assessments discriminated PSP patients and HCs with an accuracy of 63% for MRI and 80% for the combination of MRI and18F-PI-2620 PET. As compared with patients of the PSP-Richardson syndrome subgroup, those of the variant PSP subgroup profited more in terms of sensitivity from the addition of the visual18F-PI-2620 PET to the visual MRI information (35% vs. 22%). In quantitative image evaluation, midbrain-to-pons area ratio and globus pallidus DVRs discriminated best between the PSP patients and HCs, with sensitivities and specificities of 83% and 90%, respectively, for MRI and 94% and 100%, respectively, for the combination of MRI and18F-PI-2620 PET. The gain of sensitivity by adding18F-PI-2620 PET to MRI data was more marked in clinically less affected patients than in more affected patients (37% vs. 19% for visual, and 16% vs. 12% for quantitative image evaluation).Conclusion:These results provide evidence for an improved imaging-based PSP diagnosis by adding18F-PI-2620 tau PET to structural MRI. This approach seems to be particularly promising at earlier disease stages and could be of value both for improving early clinical PSP diagnosis and for enriching PSP cohorts for trials of disease-modifying drugs.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35422444/
Copper-64-diacetyl-bis(N(4)-methylthiosemicarbazone) pharmacokinetics in FaDu xenograft tumors and correlation with microscopic markers of hypoxia,"Keisha C McCall, John L Humm, Rachel Bartlett, Megan Reese, Sean Carlin","Purpose: The behavior of copper-64-diacetyl-bis(N(4)-methylthiosemicarbazone) ((64)Cu-ATSM) in hypoxic tumors was examined through a combination of in vivo dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) and ex vivo autoradiographic and histologic evaluation using a xenograft model of head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma.

Methods and materials: (64)Cu-ATSM was administered during dynamic PET imaging, and temporal changes in (64)Cu-ATSM distribution within tumors were evaluated for at least 1 hour and up to 18 hours. Animals were sacrificed at either 1 hour (cohort A) or after 18 hours (cohort B) postinjection of radiotracer and autoradiography performed. Ex vivo analysis of microenvironment subregions was conducted by immunohistochemical staining for markers of hypoxia (pimonidazole hydrochloride) and blood flow (Hoechst-33342).

Results: Kinetic analysis revealed rapid uptake of radiotracer by tumors. The net influx (K(i)) constant was 12-fold that of muscle, whereas the distribution volume (V(d)) was 5-fold. PET images showed large tumor-to-muscle ratios, which continually increased over the entire 18-hour course of imaging. However, no spatial changes in (64)Cu-ATSM distribution occurred in PET imaging at 20 minutes postinjection. Microscopic intratumoral distribution of (64)Cu-ATSM and pimonidazole were not correlated at 1 hour or after 18 hours postinjection, nor was (64)Cu-ATSM and Hoechst-33342.

Conclusions: The oxygen partial pressures at which (64)Cu-ATSM and pimonidazole are reduced and bound in cells are theorized to be distinct and separable. However, this study demonstrated that microscopic distributions of these tracers within tumors are independent. Researchers have shown (64)Cu-ATSM uptake to be specific to malignant expression, and this work has also demonstrated clear tumor targeting by the radiotracer.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22727887/
Imaging joint infections using D-methyl-11C-methionine PET/MRI: initial experience in humans,"Ilona Polvoy, Youngho Seo, Matthew Parker, Megan Stewart, Khadija Siddiqua, Harrison S Manacsa, Vahid Ravanfar, Joseph Blecha, Thomas A Hope, Henry Vanbrocklin, Robert R Flavell, Jeffrey Barry, Erik Hansen, Javier E Villanueva-Meyer, Joanne Engel, Oren S Rosenberg, David M Wilson, Michael A Ohliger","Purpose: Non-invasive imaging is a key clinical tool for detection and treatment monitoring of infections. Existing clinical imaging techniques are frequently unable to distinguish infection from tumors or sterile inflammation. This challenge is well-illustrated by prosthetic joint infections that often complicate joint replacements. D-methyl-11C-methionine (D-11C-Met) is a new bacteria-specific PET radiotracer, based on an amino acid D-enantiomer, that is rapidly incorporated into the bacterial cell wall. In this manuscript, we describe the biodistribution, radiation dosimetry, and initial human experience using D-11C-Met in patients with suspected prosthetic joint infections.

Methods: 614.5 ± 100.2 MBq of D-11C-Met was synthesized using an automated in-loop radiosynthesis method and administered to six healthy volunteers and five patients with suspected prosthetic joint infection, who were studied by PET/MRI. Time-activity curves were used to calculate residence times for each source organ. Absorbed doses to each organ and body effective doses were calculated using OLINDA/EXM 1.1 with both ICRP 60 and ICRP 103 tissue weighting factors. SUVmaxand SUVpeakwere calculated for volumes of interest (VOIs) in joints with suspected infection, the unaffected contralateral joint, blood pool, and soft tissue background. A two-tissue compartment model was used for kinetic modeling.

Results: D-11C-Met was well tolerated in all subjects. The tracer showed clearance from both urinary (rapid) and hepatobiliary (slow) pathways as well as low effective doses. Moreover, minimal background was observed in both organs with resident micro-flora and target organs, such as the spine and musculoskeletal system. Additionally, D-11C-Met showed increased focal uptake in areas of suspected infection, demonstrated by a significantly higher SUVmaxand SUVpeakcalculated from VOIs of joints with suspected infections compared to the contralateral joints, blood pool, and background (P < 0.01). Furthermore, higher distribution volume and binding potential were observed in suspected infections compared to the unaffected joints.

Conclusion: D-11C-Met has a favorable radiation profile, minimal background uptake, and fast urinary extraction. Furthermore, D-11C-Met showed increased uptake in areas of suspected infection, making this a promising approach. Validation in larger clinical trials with a rigorous gold standard is still required.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35732972/
A model-constrained Monte Carlo method for blind arterial input function estimation in dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI: II. In vivo results,"Matthias C Schabel, Edward V R DiBella, Randy L Jensen, Karen L Salzman","Accurate quantification of pharmacokinetic model parameters in tracer kinetic imaging experiments requires correspondingly accurate determination of the arterial input function (AIF). Despite significant effort expended on methods of directly measuring patient-specific AIFs in modalities as diverse as dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI), dynamic positron emission tomography (PET), and perfusion computed tomography (CT), fundamental and technical difficulties have made consistent and reliable achievement of that goal elusive. Here, we validate a new algorithm for AIF determination, the Monte Carlo blind estimation (MCBE) method (which is described in detail and characterized by extensive simulations in a companion paper), by comparing AIFs measured in DCE-MRI studies of eight brain tumor patients with results of blind estimation. Blind AIFs calculated with the MCBE method using a pool of concentration-time curves from a region of normal brain tissue were found to be quite similar to the measured AIFs, with statistically significant decreases in fit residuals observed in six of eight patients. Biases between the blind and measured pharmacokinetic parameters were the dominant source of error. Averaged over all eight patients, the mean biases were +7% in K(trans), 0% in k(ep), -11% in v(p) and +10% in v(e). Corresponding uncertainties (median absolute deviation from the best fit line) were 0.0043 min(-1) in K(trans), 0.0491 min(-1) in k(ep), 0.29% in v(p) and 0.45% in v(e). The use of a published population-averaged AIF resulted in larger mean biases in three of the four parameters (-23% in K(trans), -22% in k(ep), -63% in v(p)), with the bias in v(e) unchanged, and led to larger uncertainties in all four parameters (0.0083 min(-1) in K(trans), 0.1038 min(-1) in k(ep), 0.31% in v(p) and 0.95% in v(e)). When blind AIFs were calculated from a region of tumor tissue, statistically significant decreases in fit residuals were observed in all eight patients despite larger deviations of these blind AIFs from the measured AIFs. The observed decrease in root-mean-square fit residuals between the normal brain and tumor tissue blind AIFs suggests that the local blood supply in tumors is measurably different from that in normal brain tissue and that the proposed method is able to discriminate between the two. We have shown the feasibility of applying the MCBE algorithm to DCE-MRI data acquired in brain, finding generally good agreement with measured AIFs and decreased biases and uncertainties relative to the use of a population-averaged AIF. These results demonstrate that the MCBE algorithm is a useful alternative to direct AIF measurement in cases where acquisition of high-quality arterial input function data is difficult or impossible.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20679695/
Improving PET receptor binding estimates from Logan plots using principal component analysis,"Aniket Joshi, Jeffrey A Fessler, Robert A Koeppe","This work reports a principal component analysis (PCA)-based approach for reducing bias in distribution volume ratio (DVR) estimates from Logan plots in positron emission tomography (PET). Comparison has been made of all existing bias-removal methods with the proposed PCA method, for both single-estimate PET studies and intervention studies where pre- and post-intervention estimates are made. Bias in Logan-based DVR estimates is because of the noise in the PET time-activity curves (TACs) that propagates as correlated errors in dependent and independent variables of the Logan equation. Intervention studies show this same bias but also higher variance in DVR estimates. In this work, noise in the TACs was reduced by fitting the curves to a low-dimension PCA-based linear model, leading to reduced bias and variance in DVR. For validating the approach, TACs with realistic noise were simulated for a 11C-labeled tracer with carfentanil (CFN)-like kinetics for both single-measurement and intervention studies. Principal component analysis and existing methods were applied to the simulated data and their performance was compared by statistical analysis. The results indicated that existing methods either removed only part of the bias or reduced bias at the expense of precision. The proposed method removed approximately 90% of the bias while also improving precision in both single- and dual-measurement simulations. After validation of the proposed method in simulations, PCA, along with the existing methods, was applied to human [11C]CFN data acquired for both single estimation of DVR and dual-estimation intervention studies. Similar results were observed in human scans as were seen in the simulation studies.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18059434/
Decreased synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A binding in a rodent model of familial Alzheimer's disease detected by [18F]SDM-16,"Chao Zheng, Takuya Toyonaga, Baosheng Chen, LaShae Nicholson, William Mennie, Michael Liu, Joshua Spurrier, Kristin Deluca, Stephen M Strittmatter, Richard E Carson, Yiyun Huang, Zhengxin Cai","Introduction: Synapse loss is one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and is associated with cognitive decline. In this study, we tested [18F]SDM-16, a novel metabolically stable SV2A PET imaging probe, in the transgenic APPswe/PS1dE9 (APP/PS1) mouse model of AD and age-matched wild-type (WT) mice at 12 months of age.

Methods: Based on previous preclinical PET imaging studies using [11C]UCB-J and [18F]SynVesT-1 in the same strain animals, we used the simplified reference tissue model (SRTM), with brain stem as the pseudo reference region to calculate distribution volume ratios (DVRs).

Results: To simplify and streamline the quantitative analysis, we compared the standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs) from different imaging windows to DVRs and found that the averaged SUVRs from 60-90 min post-injection (p.i.) are most consistent with the DVRs. Thus, we used averaged SUVRs from 60-90 min for group comparisons and found statistically significant differences in the tracer uptake in different brain regions, e.g., hippocampus (p= 0.001), striatum (p= 0.002), thalamus (p= 0.003), and cingulate cortex (p= 0.0003).

Conclusions: In conclusion, [18F]SDM-16 was used to detect decreased SV2A levels in the brain of APP/PS1 AD mouse model at one year old. Our data suggest that [18F]SDM-16 has similar statistical power in detecting the synapse loss in APP/PS1 mice as [11C]UCB-J and [18F]SynVesT-1, albeit later imaging window (60-90 minp.i.) is needed when SUVR is used as a surrogate for DVR for [18F]SDM-16 due to its slower brain kinetics.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36846134/
Myocardial kinetics of carbon-11-epinephrine in the isolated working rat heart,"N T Nguyen, T R DeGrado, P Chakraborty, D M Wieland, M Schwaiger","The kinetics of EPI were studied in the isolated rat heart model to evaluate 11C-epinephrine (EPI) as a radiotracer for the assessment of sympathetic neuronal function in the heart.

Methods: Isolated rat hearts were perfused in a working mode. Carbon-11-EPI was added to the perfusate during wash-in period of 20 min, followed by a washout period of 40 min. Radioactivity in the heart was externally monitored and time-activity curves were recorded as a function of time. Effluent samples were collected throughout each study to determine the fraction of 11C radioactivity as intact tracer.

Results: Time-activity curves of control hearts showed that 11C-EPI is taken up and retained by the myocardium. Desipramine inhibition (DMI) of uptake-1 resulted in a significant decrease in myocardial uptake and retention of 11C-EPI by 91% compared to controls. Addition of DMI to the perfusion medium during washout did not affect kinetics of 11C-EPI compared to control hearts. Reserpine pretreated rat hearts also showed significant decrease in tracer retention of 95% compared to controls. The metabolic data showed that, in control conditions, about 61% of 11C-EPI taken up by the rat heart is rapidly metabolized and released.

Conclusion: Carbon-11-EPI traces sympathetic nerve terminals in the isolated rat heart. Uptake blockade by DMI and reserpine suggest that uptake and storage of 11C-EPI appear to be similar to that of norepinephrine. However, the prominent metabolic pathway warrants further consideration. These results suggest that 11C-EPI may be a suitable radiolabeled tracer for the evaluation of sympathetic vesicular function of the heart by PET.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9170446/

However, the slow kinetics of [(18)F]FMISO require a 2-h delay between tracer administration and patient scanning. Labelled chloroethyl sulfoxides have shown faster kinetics and higher contrast than [(18)F]FMISO in a rat model of ischemic stroke. However, these nitrogen mustard analogues are unsuitable for routine production and use in humans. Here we report on the synthesis and in vitro and in vivo evaluation of two novel sulfoxides which we synthesised from a single precursor molecule via either 2-[(18)F]fluoroethyl azide click chemistry or conventional nucleophilic displacement of a chloride leaving group. The yields of the click chemistry approach were 90±5% of [(18)F]2 based on 2-[(18)F]fluoroethyl azide, and the yields for the S(N) reaction were 15±5% of [(18)F]1 based on K[(18)F]F. Both radiotracers underwent metabolism in an in vitro assay using S9 liver fractions with biological half-lives of 32.39 and 43.32 min, respectively. Imaging studies using an SK-RC-52 tumor model in BALB/c nude mice have revealed that only [(18)F]1 is retained in hypoxic tumors, whereas [(18)F]2 is cleared from those tumors at a rate similar to that of muscle tissue. [(18)F]1 has emerged as a promising new lead structure for further development of sulfoxide-based hypoxia imaging agents.

Difference in in vivo receptor binding between [3H]N-methylspiperone and [3H]raclopride in reserpine-treated mouse brain,"O Inoue, K Kobayashi, H Tsukada, T Itoh, B Langstrom","The in vivo binding of [3H]N-methylspiperone (NMSP) and [3H]raclopride was compared in mice treated with reserpine (5 mg/kg, 24 hr prior to the tracer injection). With both radioligands, selective accumulation of radioactivity in the striatum following intravenous injection was observed, whereas a relatively low accumulation and a rapid decline in radioactivity in the cerebellum was seen. Reserpine significantly decreased [3H]NMSP binding in vivo, however it increased [3H]raclopride binding. By compartment model analysis, it was found that the decrease in [3H]NMSP binding was primarily due to the decrease in the association rate (K3) and the increase in [3H]raclopride was due to the decrease in the dissociation rate (K4) in vivo. As both Kd and Bmax of dopamine D2 receptors have been reported to be unaltered by reserpine, these results suggested that some unknown factors except Kd and Bmax which influence on in vivo binding of receptors might be changed by reserpine. These results revealed that it is of importance to measure kinetics of ligand-receptor binding in vivo rather than static analysis. These two different types of radioligands can be combined to reveal functional roles of dopamine receptor in vivo, especially in the study of the human brain with positron emission tomography (PET).",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1678266/
Brain receptor imaging,"Wolf-Dieter Heiss, Karl Herholz","Receptors have a prominent role in brain function, as they are the effector sites of neurotransmission at the postsynaptic membrane, have a regulatory role on presynaptic sites for transmitter reuptake and feedback, and are modulating various functions on the cell membrane. Distribution, density, and activity of receptors in the brain can be visualized by radioligands labeled for SPECT and PET, and the receptor binding can be quantified by appropriate tracer kinetic models, which can be modified and simplified for particular application. Selective radioligands are available for the various transmitter systems, by which the distribution of these receptors in the normal brain and changes in receptor binding during various physiologic activities or resulting from pathologic conditions can be visualized. The quantitative imaging for several receptors has gained clinical importance-for example, dopamine (D2)) receptors for differential diagnosis of movement disorders and for assessment of receptor occupancy by neuroleptics drugs; serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) receptors and the 5-HT transporter in affective disorders and for assessment of activity of antidepressants; nicotinic receptors and acetylcholinesterase as markers of cognitive and memory impairment; central benzodiazepine-binding sites at the gamma-aminobutyric acid A (GABAA) receptor complex as markers of neuronal integrity in neurodegenerative disorders, epilepsy, and stroke and as the site of action of benzodiazepines; peripheral benzodiazepine receptors as indicators of inflammatory changes; opioid receptors detecting increased cortical excitability in focal epilepsy but also affected in perception of and emotional response to pain; and several receptor systems affected in drug abuse and craving. Further studies of the various transmitter/receptor systems and their balance and infraction will improve our understanding of complex brain functions and will provide more insight into the pathophysiology of neurologic and psychiatric disease interaction.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16455637/

Radiation doses after intravenous administration of the tracer in mice and piglets were assessed to determine the organ doses (ODs) and the effective dose (ED) to humans. The results were compared with subsequent clinical investigations in human volunteers.

Methods: Twenty-seven female CD1 mice (weight ± SD, 28.2 ± 2.1 g) received intravenous injection of 0.75 ± 0.33 MBq of (-)-(18)F-flubatine. Up to 240 min after injection, 3 animals per time point were sacrificed and the organs harvested, weighed, and counted in a γ counter to determine mass and activity, respectively. Furthermore, whole-body PET scans of 5 female piglets (age ± SD, 44 ± 3 d; weight ± SD, 13.7 ± 1.7 kg) and 3 humans (2 men and 1 woman; age ± SD, 59.6 ± 3.9 y; weight ± SD, 74.3 ± 3.1 kg) were obtained up to 236 min (piglets) and 355 min (humans) after injection of 186.6 ± 7.4 and 353.7 ± 10.2 MBq of (-)-(18)F-flubatine, respectively, using a PET/CT scanner. The CT was used for delineation of the organs. Exponential curves were fitted to the time-activity-data, and time and mass scales were adapted to the human anatomy. The ODs were calculated using OLINDA/EXM (version 1.0); EDs were calculated with the tissue-weighting factors of ICRP103.

Results: After the injection of (-)-(18)F-flubatine, there were no adverse or clinically detectable pharmacologic effects in any of the subjects. The highest activities after injection were found in the kidneys, urinary bladder, and liver. The urinary bladder receives the highest OD in all investigated species, followed by the kidneys and the liver for animals and humans, respectively. On the basis of mouse, piglet, and human kinetic data, the projected human ED of (-)-(18)F-flubatine was estimated to be 12.5 μSv/MBq in mice, 14.7 ± 0.7 μSv/MBq in piglets, and 23.4 ± 0.4 μSv/MBq in humans.

Practical calculation method to estimate the absolute boron concentration in tissues using 18F-FBPA PET,"Tadashi Watabe, Kohei Hanaoka, Sadahiro Naka, Yasukazu Kanai, Hayato Ikeda, Masanao Aoki, Eku Shimosegawa, Mitsunori Kirihata, Jun Hatazawa","Purpose: The purpose of this study was to establish a practical method to estimate the absolute boron concentrations in the tissues based on the standardized uptake values (SUVs) after administration of 4-borono-phenylalanine (BPA) using 4-borono-2-18F-fluoro-phenylalanine (18F-FBPA) PET.

Methods: Rat xenograft models of C6 glioma (n = 7, body weight 241 ± 28.0 g) were used for the study. PET was performed 60 min after intravenous injection of18F-FBPA (30.5 ± 0.7 MBq). After the PET scanning, BPA-fructose (167.3 ± 18.65 mg/kg) was administered by slow intravenous injection to the same subjects. The rats were killed 60 min after the BPA injection and tissue samples were collected from the major organs and tumors. The absolute boron concentrations (unit: ppm) in the samples were measured by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). The boron concentrations in the tissues/tumors were also estimated from the18F-FBPA PET images using the following formula: estimated absolute boron concentration (ppm) = 0.0478 × [BPA dose (mg/kg)] × SUV. The measured absolute boron concentrations (mBC) by ICP-OES and the estimated boron concentrations (eBC) from the PET images were compared.

Results: The percent difference between the mBC and eBC calculated based on the SUVmaxwas -5.2 ± 21.1% for the blood, -9.4 ± 22.3% for the brain, 1.6 ± 21.3% for the liver, -14.3 ± 16.8% for the spleen, -9.5 ± 27.5% for the pancreas, and 3.4 ± 43.2% for the tumor. Relatively large underestimation was observed for the lung (-48.4 ± 16.2%), small intestine (-37.8 ± 19.3%) and large intestine (-33.9 ± 11.0%), due to the partial volume effect arising from the air or feces contained in these organs. In contrast, relatively large overestimation was observed for the kidney (34.3 ± 29.3%), due to the influence of the high uptake in urine.

Conclusions: The absolute boron concentrations in tissues/tumors can be estimated from the SUVs on18F-FBPA PET using a practical formula. Caution must be exercised in interpreting the estimated boron concentrations in the lung, small intestine and large intestine, to prevent the adverse effects of overexposure, which could occur due to underestimation by partial volume effect using PET.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28439784/
Characterization of extrastriatal D2 in vivo specific binding of [¹⁸F](N-methyl)benperidol using PET,"Sarah A Eisenstein, Jon M Koller, Marilyn Piccirillo, Ana Kim, Jo Ann V Antenor-Dorsey, Tom O Videen, Abraham Z Snyder, Morvarid Karimi, Stephen M Moerlein, Kevin J Black, Joel S Perlmutter, Tamara Hershey","PET imaging studies of the role of the dopamine D2 receptor family in movement and neuropsychiatric disorders are limited by the use of radioligands that have near-equal affinities for D2 and D3 receptor subtypes and are susceptible to competition with endogenous dopamine. By contrast, the radioligand [¹⁸F]N-methylbenperidol ([¹⁸F]NMB) has high selectivity and affinity for the D2 receptor subtype (D2R) and is not sensitive to endogenous dopamine. Although [¹⁸F]NMB has high binding levels in striatum, its utility for measuring D2R in extrastriatal regions is unknown. A composite MR-PET image was constructed across 14 healthy adult participants representing average NMB uptake 60 to 120 min after [¹⁸F]NMB injection. Regional peak radioactivity was identified using a peak-finding algorithm. FreeSurfer and manual tracing identified a priori regions of interest (ROI) on each individual's MR image and tissue activity curves were extracted from coregistered PET images. [¹⁸F]NMB binding potentials (BP(ND) s) were calculated using the Logan graphical method with cerebellum as reference region. In eight unique participants, extrastriatal BP(ND) estimates were compared between Logan graphical methods and a three-compartment kinetic tracer model. Radioactivity and BP(ND) levels were highest in striatum, lower in extrastriatal subcortical regions, and lowest in cortical regions relative to cerebellum. Age negatively correlated with striatal BP(ND) s. BP(ND) estimates for extrastriatal ROIs were highly correlated across kinetic and graphical methods. Our findings indicate that PET with [¹⁸F]NMB measures specific binding in extrastriatal regions, making it a viable radioligand to study extrastriatal D2R levels in healthy and diseased states.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22535514/
"Evaluation of the safety, biodistribution, dosimetry of [18F]AlF-NYM005 and initial experience in clear cell renal cell carcinoma: an interim analysis of a prospective trial","Liping Yang, Wei Guo, Hongchao Ding, Xing Gao, Yuchao Xu, Menglu Wang, Xinyue Yang, Yue Zhao, Wenzhi Wang, Wei Liu, Fan Jia, Dayong Hou, Abiyasi Nanding, Liang Cheng, Hongxue Meng, Kezheng Wang","Purpose: This first-in-human study aimed to evaluate the radiation dosimetry and whole-body biodistribution of [18F]AlF-NYM005, a novel small-molecule carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) targeting agent, and to investigate its ability to detect CAIX-positive tumors using PET scans in a cohort of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) patients.

Methods: [18F]AlF-NYM005 was synthesized using a fully automatic cassette module Mortenon M1 (Nuoyu, China). Thirty-five patients with a suspicious lesion considered primary renal malignancy or a history of ccRCC were prospectively recruited and studied. All patients underwent [18F]AlF-NYM005 PET/CT examinations and the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) was measured on conventional [18F]AlF-NYM005 PET/CT images. Among these patients, five patients underwent dynamic [18F]AlF-NYM005 PET/CT scanning (120 min) of the lower abdomen. Another subset of five ccRCC patients underwent sequential whole-body PET scans at 30, 60, 90, and 120 min (one of the five patients underwent additional 150 min and 180 min scans) after [18F]AlF-NYM005 injection to assess biodistribution and dosimetry. The influx constant (Ki) was calculated from the dynamic [18F]AlF-NYM005 PET/CT data using the Patlak model. Whole-body biodistribution was calculated as time-activity curves (TACs) describing dynamic uptake patterns in the patients' major organs, followed by calculation of tracer kinetics and cumulative organ activity. Effective doses of [18F]AlF-NYM005 and individual organ doses were also calculated.

Results: [18F]AlF-NYM005 was successfully synthesized with a radiochemical purity of > 95% and an average labeling yield of 36.5 ± 8.3%. All patients tolerated the PET examinations well, and no adverse side effects were observed. The total body effective dose was 7.6E-03 mSv/MBq. The highest agent uptake was observed in the kidneys, stomach, and liver, contributing to an effective dose of 0.0126 ± 0.0029 mSv/MBq. The TACs showed optimal normal organ uptake with high tumor uptake and long retention of up to 2 h post-injection. Notably, a rapid increase of the tracer followed by a rapid decrease in the blood pool, kidney, liver, and tumor lesions was observed, indicating that [18F]AlF-NYM005 was rapidly eliminated from blood and urine. For the kinetic data analysis, the Ki for the primary kidney lesions had a mean of 0.082 ± 0.057 ml/g/min. The CAIX-positive tumors displayed rapid uptake, and all lesions were detectable within 30 min, with no additional lesions observed in the subsequent multi-time point scans. The patient-level sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of [18F]AlF-NYM005 PET/CT were 93.8%, 75.0%, and 90% for group 1 and 92.3%, 100%, and 93.3% for group 2, respectively. For per-lymph node analysis, [18F]AlF-NYM005 PET/CT demonstrated 92.9% sensitivity, 90.5% specificity, and 91.8% accuracy in diagnosing metastatic lymph nodes. For per-distant metastasis analysis, it showed 90.5% sensitivity, 91.3% specificity, and 90.6% accuracy. The SUVmax of [18F]AlF-NYM005 PET/CT for primary ccRCC lesions was 15.5 ± 7.35. Tumor uptake was positive correlated with immunohistochemical staining findings.

Conclusion: This pilot study in ccRCC patients has demonstrated the safety, acceptable radiation dosimetry, favorable biodistribution, and exceptional tumor uptake of [18F]AlF-NYM005. The preliminary diagnostic study indicated the potential utility of [18F]AlF-NYM005 PET/CT, showing promising results in the diagnosis of primary or metastatic ccRCC.

Competition between 11C-raclopride and endogenous dopamine in Parkinson's disease,"Kenji Ishibashi, Kenji Ishii, Keiichi Oda, Hidehiro Mizusawa, Kiichi Ishiwata","Objective: The aim of this study was to understand whether the increase in 11C-raclopride binding in the striatum of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with the depletion of endogenous dopamine.

Methods: Positron emission tomography (PET) scans of the two dopamine D2 receptor ligands, 11C-raclopride and 11C-N-methylspiperone (11C-NMSP), and the dopamine transporter ligand, 11C-2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(4-fluorophenyl)-tropane, were performed on five patients with PD and seven controls. The binding of each tracer was calculated by using a (region-cerebellum)/cerebellum ratio in the caudate, anterior putamen, and posterior putamen.

Results: In patients with PD, the 11C-raclopride to 11C-NMSP ratios in the posterior putamen, which was the subregion of the striatum with the lowest binding of 11C-2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(4-fluorophenyl)-tropane, were the largest among all three subregions of the striatum. In controls, the 11C-raclopride to 11C-NMSP ratios in all three subregions of the striatum were within a constant range.

Conclusion: In patients with PD, the kinetic difference between 11C-raclopride and 11C-NMSP was found prominently in the posterior putamen, in which presynaptic degeneration occurred most profoundly. Therefore, we concluded that the increase in 11C-raclopride binding in the striatum of patients with PD was strongly associated with the depletion of endogenous dopamine. 11C-NMSP can be chosen in the place of 11C-raclopride in cases in which it may be essential to eliminate the influence of endogenous dopamine.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19966595/
Myocardial glucose uptake in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus assessed quantitatively by dynamic positron emission tomography,"J vom Dahl, W H Herman, R J Hicks, F J Ortiz-Alonso, K S Lee, K C Allman, E R Wolfe Jr, V Kalff, M Schwaiger","Background: Animal studies have demonstrated reduced myocardial glucose utilization in the diabetic heart, suggesting abnormalities in glucose transport. This study was designed to evaluate myocardial glucose uptake as assessed by 2-fluoro-(fluorine-18)2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) and positron emission tomography (PET) in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) under standardized metabolic conditions.

Methods and results: A hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp technique was used during PET data acquisition in nine healthy male volunteers and seven young male patients with a history of IDDM for less than 5 years. Oxidative metabolism was assessed with C-11 acetate, and glucose uptake was quantitatively measured with FDG using Patlak graphic analysis. Hemodynamic data and C-11 acetate kinetics were comparable. Myocardial glucose uptake averaged 0.44 +/- 0.12 mumol.g-1.min-1 in normal subjects and 0.43 +/- 0.16 mumol.g-1.min-1 in patients with IDDM (P = NS). Blood tracer clearance was also similar in both groups as determined by the ratio of peak blood tracer activity to the activity at 55 to 60 minutes after tracer injection. F-18 activity ratio between myocardium and blood pool averaged 7.2 +/- 3.4 in the normal heart and 7.5 +/- 3.0 in the diabetic heart (P = NS).

Conclusions: These data indicate that metabolic standardization and supplementation with insulin in young patients with IDDM is associated with myocardial glucose uptake similar to that observed in the normal heart. Chronic therapy with insulin may prevent the metabolic abnormalities observed in diabetic animal models.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8339403/
In vivo kinetics of [18F](N-methyl)benperidol: a novel PET tracer for assessment of dopaminergic D2-like receptor binding,"S M Moerlein, J S Perlmutter, J Markham, M J Welch","A novel D2-like receptor-binding radioligand, [18F](N-methyl)benperidol ([18F]NMB), was evaluated via positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging studies of baboons. [18F]NMB rapidly localized in vivo within dopaminergic receptor-rich cerebral tissues, and striatum-to-cerebellum ratios as high as 35 were achieved after 3 hours. Pretreatment of an animal with unlabeled receptor-specific antagonists before injection of [18F]NMB confirmed that the radioligand bound specifically to central D2-like receptors in vivo, and not to S2- or D1-like receptors. Unlabeled eticlopride displaced striatal [18F]NMB in vivo, showing that D2-like binding is reversible. Receptor-binding by the radioligand was resistant to competitive displacement by synaptic dopamine, as illustrated by the lack of effect of intravenous d-amphetamine on the in vivo localization of [18F]NMB. Studies involving sequential intravenous administration of [18F]NMB, d-amphetamine, and eticlopride show that the radioligand does not undergo agonist-mediated internalization with subsequent trapping. The feasibility of applying a three-compartment non-steady state model for quantification of [18F]NMB receptor binding was demonstrated. These in vivo characteristics give [18F]NMB distinct advantages over the PET radiopharmaceuticals currently used for clinical investigation of D2-like receptor binding.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9290581/
Small-animal PET of tumors with (64)Cu-labeled RGD-bombesin heterodimer,"Zhaofei Liu, Zi-Bo Li, Qizhen Cao, Shuanglong Liu, Fan Wang, Xiaoyuan Chen","The overexpression of gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR) in various tumor types suggests that GRPR is an attractive target for cancer imaging and therapy with radiolabeled bombesin analogs. We recently reported the ability of (18)F-labeled RGD-bombesin heterodimer to be used for dual integrin alpha(v)beta(3)- and GRPR-targeted imaging. To further investigate the synergistic effect of the dual-receptor targeting of peptide heterodimers, we evaluated (64)Cu-labeled RGD-bombesin for PET imaging of tumors.

Methods: RGD-bombesin was coupled with 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-N, N', N'', N'''-tetraacetic acid (DOTA) and 1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1,4,7-triacetic acid (NOTA), and the conjugates were labeled with (64)Cu. The in vitro and in vivo characteristics of (64)Cu-NOTA-RGD-bombesin were compared with those of (64)Cu-NOTA-RGD, (64)Cu-NOTA-bombesin, and (64)Cu-DOTA-RGD-bombesin.

Results: (64)Cu-NOTA-RGD-bombesin and (64)Cu-DOTA-RGD-bombesin had comparable dual integrin alpha(v)beta(3)- and GRPR-binding affinities in vitro, both of which were slightly lower than RGD for integrin binding and bombesin for GRPR binding. (64)Cu-NOTA-RGD-bombesin possessed significantly higher tumor uptake than did (64)Cu-NOTA-RGD, (64)Cu-NOTA-bombesin, the mixture of (64)Cu-NOTA-RGD and (64)Cu-NOTA-bombesin, or (64)Cu-DOTA-RGD-bombesin in PC-3 prostate cancer. (64)Cu-NOTA-RGD-bombesin also showed improved in vivo kinetics such as lower liver and intestinal activity accumulation than did the bombesin tracers. (64)Cu-NOTA-RGD-bombesin also outperformed (64)Cu-NOTA-RGD in a 4T1 murine mammary carcinoma model that expresses integrin on tumor vasculature but no GRPR in tumor tissue, which had no uptake of (64)Cu-NOTA-bombesin.

Conclusion: Compared with other tracers, (64)Cu-NOTA-RGD-bombesin showed favorable in vivo kinetics and enhanced tumor uptake, which warrants its further investigation for targeting tumors that express integrin or GRPR or that coexpress integrin and GRPR for imaging and therapeutic applications. The synergistic effect of RGD-bombesin heterodimers observed in this study also encourages further investigations of novel heterodimers recognizing other cell surface receptors for tumor targeting.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19525469/
PET Imaging of Neurofibromatosis Type 1 with a Fluorine-18 Labeled Tryptophan Radiotracer,"Xuyi Yue, Erik Stauff, Shriya Boyapati, Sigrid A Langhans, Wenqi Xu, Sokratis Makrogiannis, Uchenna J Okorie, Azubuike M Okorie, Vinay V R Kandula, Heidi H Kecskemethy, Rahul M Nikam, Lauren W Averill, Thomas H Shaffer","Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a neurocutaneous disorder. Plexiform neurofibromas (PNFs) are benign tumors commonly formed in patients with NF1. PNFs have a high incidence of developing into malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) with a 5-year survival rate of only 30%. Therefore, the accurate diagnosis and differentiation of MPNSTs from benign PNFs are critical to patient management. We studied a fluorine-18 labeled tryptophan positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer, 1-(2-[18F]fluoroethyl)-L-tryptophan (L-[18F]FETrp), to detect NF1-associated tumors in an animal model. An ex vivo biodistribution study of L-[18F]FETrp showed a similar tracer distribution and kinetics between the wild-type and triple mutant mice with the highest uptake in the pancreas. Bone uptake was stable. Brain uptake was low during the 90-min uptake period. Static PET imaging at 60 min post-injection showed L-[18F]FETrp had a comparable tumor uptake with [1⁸F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). However, L-[18F]FETrp showed a significantly higher tumor-to-brain ratio than FDG (n= 4,p< 0.05). Sixty-minute-long dynamic PET scans using the two radiotracers showed similar kidney, liver, and lung kinetics. A dysregulated tryptophan metabolism in NF1 mice was further confirmed using immunohistostaining. L-[18F]FETrp is warranted to further investigate differentiating malignant NF1 tumors from benign PNFs. The study may reveal the tryptophan-kynurenine pathway as a therapeutic target for treating NF1.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38931352/
Characterization of Structurally Diverse 18F-Labeled d-TCO Derivatives as a PET Probe for Bioorthogonal Pretargeted Imaging,"Karuna Adhikari, Jonatan Dewulf, Christel Vangestel, Pieter Van der Veken, Sigrid Stroobants, Filipe Elvas, Koen Augustyns","The pretargeted imaging strategy using inverse electron demand Diels-Alder (IEDDA) cycloaddition between atrans-cyclooctene (TCO) and tetrazine (Tz) has emerged and rapidly grown as a promising concept to improve radionuclide imaging and therapy in oncology. This strategy has mostly relied on the use of radiolabeled Tz together with TCO-modified targeting vectors leading to a rapid growth of the number of available radiolabeled tetrazines, while only a few radiolabeled TCOs are currently reported. Here, we aim to develop novel and structurally diverse18F-labeled cis-dioxolane-fused TCO (d-TCO) derivatives to further expand the bioorthogonal toolbox forin vivoligation and evaluate their potential for positron emission tomography (PET) pretargeted imaging.Results:A small series of d-TCO derivatives were synthesized and tested for their reactivity against tetrazines, with all compounds showing fast reaction kinetics with tetrazines. A fluorescence-based pretargeted blocking study was developed to investigate thein vivoligation of these compounds without labor-intensive prior radiochemical development. Two compounds showed excellentin vivoligation results with blocking efficiencies of 95 and 97%. Two novel18F-labeled d-TCO radiotracers were developed, from which [18F]MICA-214showed goodin vitrostability, favorable pharmacokinetics, and moderatein vivostability. Micro-PET pretargeted imaging with [18F]MICA-214in mice bearing LS174T tumors treated with tetrazine-modified CC49 monoclonal antibody (mAb) (CC49-Tz) showed significantly higher uptake in tumor tissue in the pretargeted group (CC49-Tz 2.16 ± 0.08% ID/mL) when compared to the control group with nonmodified mAb (CC49 1.34 ± 0.07% ID/mL).Conclusions:A diverse series of fast-reacting fluorinated d-TCOs were synthesized. A pretargeted blocking approach in tumor-bearing mice allowed the choice of a lead compound with fast reaction kinetics with Tz. A novel18F-labeled d-TCO tracer was developed and used in a pretargeted PET imaging approach, allowing specific tumor visualization in a mouse model of colorectal cancer. Although further optimization of the radiotracer is needed to enhance the tumor-to-background ratios for pretargeted imaging, we anticipate that the18F-labeled d-TCO will find use in studies where increased hydrophilicity and fast bioconjugation are required.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37867688/
Evaluation of 4'-[methyl-11C]thiothymidine in a rodent tumor and inflammation model,"Jun Toyohara, Philip H Elsinga, Kiichi Ishiwata, Jurgen W A Sijbesma, Rudi A J O Dierckx, Aren van Waarde","4'-[methyl-(11)C]thiothymidine ((11)C-4DST) is a novel radiopharmaceutical that can be used for tumor imaging because of its rapid incorporation into DNA as a substrate for DNA synthesis. The in vivo stability of (11)C-4DST is much greater than that of natural thymidine, because of the presence of a sulfur atom in the 4'-position. Here, we evaluated the tissue kinetics and biodistribution of (11)C-4DST in a rodent tumor and acute sterile inflammation model in comparison with the previously published biodistribution data of 3'-deoxy-3'-(18)F-fluorothymidine ((18)F-FLT), (18)F-FDG, (11)C-choline, (11)C-methionine, and 2 σ-receptor ligands in the same animal model.

Methods: C6 tumor cells were implanted subcutaneously into the right shoulder and turpentine (0.1 mL) was injected intramuscularly into the left hind leg of male Wistar rats 11 d and 24 h, respectively, before the scanning day. The animals were anesthetized with isoflurane, and (11)C-4DST (20-50 MBq) was injected intravenously. A dynamic PET scan was performed for 60 min with either the shoulder or hind leg region in the field of view. The animals were sacrificed, and a biodistribution study was performed.

Results: (11)C-4DST showed the highest tumor uptake (standardized uptake value, 4.93) of all radiopharmaceuticals tested. Its tumor-to-muscle concentration ratio (12.7) was similar to that of (18)F-FDG (13.2). The selectivity of (11)C-4DST for tumor as compared with acute inflammation was high (37.7), comparable to that of the σ-ligand (18)F-FE-SA5845 and much higher than that of (18)F-FDG (3.5). Rapidly proliferating tissues (tumor and bone marrow) showed a steadily increasing uptake. In inflamed muscle, (11)C-4DST showed relatively rapid washout, and tracer concentrations in inflamed and noninflamed muscle were not significantly different at intervals greater than 40 min. Competition of endogenous thymidine for (11)C-4DST uptake in target tissues was negligible, in contrast to competition for (18)F-FLT uptake. Thus, pretreatment of animals with thymidine phosphorylase was not required before PET with (11)C-4DST.

Conclusion: In our rodent model, (11)C-4DST showed high tumor uptake (sensitivity) and high tumor selectivity. The different kinetics of (11)C-4DST in rapidly proliferating and inflammatory tissue may allow distinction between tumor and acute inflammation in a clinical setting. These promising results for (11)C-4DST warrant further investigation in PET studies in patients with various types of tumors.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22315439/

Herein, the development of a new PET radioligand, [11C]CNY-10 is reported, which may enable brain RIPK1 imaging. [11C]CNY-10 is radiosynthesized with a high radiochemical yield (41.8%) and molar activity (305 GBq/µmol).

It is performed autoradiography of [11C]CNY-10 in human AD and healthy control postmortem brain tissues, which shows strong radiosignal in AD brains higher than healthy controls. Subsequently, it is conducted further characterization of RIPK1 in AD using [11C]CNY-10-based PET studies in combination with immunohistochemistry leveraging the 5xFAD mouse model. It is found that AD mice revealed RIPK1 brain signal significantly higher than WT control mice and that RIPK1 is closely related to amyloid plaques in the brain.

Simultaneous measurement of myocardial oxygen consumption and blood flow using [1-carbon-11]acetate,"K T Sun, L A Yeatman, D B Buxton, K Chen, J A Johnson, S C Huang, K F Kofoed, S Weismueller, J Czernin, M E Phelps, H R Schelbert","[1-Carbon-11]acetate has been used as a tracer for oxidative metabolism with PET. The aim of this study was to validate, in humans, a previously proposed two-compartment model for [1-11C]acetate for the noninvasive measurement of myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO2) and myocardial blood flow (MBF) with PET.

Methods: Twelve healthy volunteers were studied with [13N]ammonia, [1-11C]acetate and PET. Myocardial oxygen consumption was invasively determined by the Fick method from arterial and coronary sinus O2 concentrations and from MBF obtained by [13N]ammonia PET.

Results: Directly measured MVO2 ranged from 5.2 to 11.1 ml/100g/min, and MBF ranged from 0.48 to 0.88 ml/g/min. Oxidative flux through the tricarboxylic acid cycle, reflected by the rate constant k2, which correlated linearly with measured MVO2 [k2 = 0.0071 + 0.0074(MVO2); r = 0.74, s.e.e. = 0.015]. With this correlation, MVO2 could be estimated from the model-derived k2 value by MVO2 = 135(k2) - 0.96. The slope of this relationship was close to that previously obtained in rats and implies that the tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediate metabolite pool sizes are comparable. The net extraction (K1) of [1-11C]acetate, measured by PET, from blood into myocardium correlated closely with MBF by K1 = 0.15 + 0.73(MBF) (r = 0.93, s.e.e. = 0.033) and, thus, provided noninvasively obtainable measures of blood flow.

Conclusion: The proposed compartment model for [1-11C]acetate fits the measured kinetics well and, with proper calibration, allows estimation of absolute MVO2 rather than only an index of oxidative metabolism. Furthermore, [1-11C]acetate-derived estimates of MBF are feasible.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9476935/

PET using the benzothiazole derivative11C-PiB has been successfully used to quantify myelin content changes in humans. Stilbene derivatives, such as11C-MeDAS, have also been shown to bind to myelin in animals and are considered a promising radiopharmaceutical class for myelin imaging. Fluorinated compounds from both classes are now commercially available and thus should constitute clinically useful myelin radiotracers. The aim of this study is to provide a head-to-head comparison of18F-florbetaben,18F-florbetapir,18F-flutemetamol,11C-MeDAS, and11C-PiB with regard to brain kinetics and binding in white matter (WM).

Methods: Four baboons underwent a 90-min dynamic PET scan for each radioligand. Arterial blood samples were collected during the exam for each radiotracer, except for18F-florbetapir, to obtain a radiometabolite-corrected input function. Standardized uptake value ratio between 75 at 90 min (SUVR75-90), binding potential (BP) estimated with Logan method with input function, and distribution volume ratio (DVR) estimated with Logan reference method (using cerebellar gray matter as reference region) were calculated in WM and compared between tracers using mixed effect models.

Results: In WM,18F-florbetapir had the highest SUVR75-90(1.38 ± 0.03), followed by18F-flutemetamol (1.34 ± 0.02),18F-florbetaben (1.32 ± 0.07),11C-MeDAS (1.27 ± 0.04), and11C-PiB (1.25 ± 0.07). With regard to BP,18F-florbetaben had the highest value (0.32 ± 0.06) compared with18F-flutemetamol (0.20 ± 0.03),11C-MeDAS (0.17 ± 0.03), and11C-PiB (0.16 ± 0.03).

To evaluate the usefulness of 1-(11)C-octanoate for studying ischemic stroke, we investigated the brain distribution of 1-(14)C-octanoate and compared it with N-isopropyl-p-(123)I-iodoamphetamine ((123)I-IMP) distribution (cerebral blood flow), (123)I-iomazenil ((123)I-IMZ) distribution (neuronal viability based on (123)I-IMZ binding to benzodiazepine receptors), and hematoxylin-eosin stain (morphologic changes) in a rat model of focal cerebral ischemia.

Methods: The right middle cerebral artery of each rat was occluded intraluminally. The brain distribution of 1-(14)C-octanoate and (123)I-IMP (or (123)I-IMZ) was determined 4 and 24 h after the insult using a dual-tracer autoradiographic technique (n = 4-7 in each group). Coronal brain sections adjacent to those used for autoradiography were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Regions of interest (ROIs) were determined for 3 coronal slices, and asymmetry indices (AIs, lesion/normal hemisphere) of the tracer uptake were calculated. ROIs on the hemisphere with the lesion were classified into 4 groups: In region A, widespread necrotic cells were observed; in region B, necrotic cells were occasionally observed; in region C1, no morphologic changes were observed and the AIs for (123)I-IMP (or (123)I-IMZ) were <or=0.8; and in region C2, no morphologic changes were observed and the AIs for (123)I-IMP (or (123)I-IMZ) were >0.8.

Results: 1-(14)C-Octanoate uptake decreased in the regions where morphologic changes were observed (regions A and B) but was relatively preserved in the surrounding region without morphologic changes despite reduced (123)I-IMP and (123)I-IMZ uptake (region C1). In the region without morphologic changes (region C1), AIs for 1-(14)C-octanoate were significantly higher than those for (123)I-IMP (4 h, 0.73 +/- 0.23 for 1-(14)C-octanoate and 0.37 +/- 0.20 for (123)I-IMP, P < 0.0001; 24 h, 0.84 +/- 0.11 for 1-(14)C-octanoate and 0.44 +/- 0.15 for (123)I-IMP, P < 0.0001) and those for (123)I-IMZ (4 h, 0.83 +/- 0.19 for 1-(14)C-octanoate and 0.57 +/- 0.13 for (123)I-IMZ, P < 0.0001; 24 h, 0.91 +/- 0.13 for 1-(14)C-octanoate and 0.73 +/- 0.06 for (123)I-IMZ, P < 0.0001).

Conclusion: 1-(14)C-Octanoate uptake was relatively preserved in the regions without morphologic changes despite reduced (123)I-IMP and (123)I-IMZ uptake. 1-(11)C-Octanoate may provide further functional information on the pathophysiology of ischemic stroke, reflecting astroglial function based on fatty acid metabolism.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12843233/
In vivo imaging of the brain vesicular monoamine transporter,"T M Vander Borght, M R Kilbourn, R A Koeppe, J N DaSilva, J E Carey, D E Kuhl, K A Frey","In the search for an in vivo marker of monoamine nerve terminal integrity, we investigated methoxytetrabenazine (MTBZ) as a tracer of the brain synaptic vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT2).

Methods: The biodistribution, metabolism and in vivo specificity of MTBZ binding were first evaluated in rodents and the human dosimetry was estimated. Subsequently, the human brain distribution of VMAT2 binding was determined in normal volunteers following administration of [11C]MTBZ. Brain regional time-activity curves were obtained, and parametric transport and binding images were calculated using arterial blood sampling and a two-compartment tracer kinetic model.

Results: Regional rat brain localization of [3H]MTBZ 15 min postinjection was consistent with the known monoamine nerve terminal density, which demonstrated the highest activity in the striatum, lateral septum, substantia nigra pars compacta, the raphe nuclei and the locus coeruleus. At this time, chromatography revealed over 82% of brain activity, but less than 47% of plasma activity corresponded to authentic MTBZ. In vivo [11C]MTBZ binding in the mouse brain was inhibited by coinjection of excess unlabeled dihydrotetrabenazine. In humans [11C]MTBZ had high initial brain uptake and rapid clearance from all regions, with longest retention in areas of high VMAT2 concentration. Parametric quantification of VMAT2 density revealed the highest distribution volume in the putamen and caudate with lower values in cerebral cortex and cerebellum.

Conclusion: Carbon-11-MTBZ is a suitable ligand for PET quantification of the vesicular monoamine transporter in the human brain.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8523116/
Intersoftware variability impacts classification of cardiac PET exams,"Joaquim Barreto Oliveira, Yew Min Sen, Kshama Wechalekar","Background: Myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) with82Rb PET/CT is increasingly utilized in the evaluation of coronary artery disease with high diagnostic accuracy. Various softwares for data processing have been developed over the years with conflicting data regarding their reproducibility. In this study, we compared the quantitative results of myocardial perfusion and exam classification from three different softwares.

Methods: Data from consecutive patients who have undergone rest/stress82Rb PET/CT MPI at the Royal Brompton & Harefield Trust, London, were analyzed. All data were processed using the Corridor 4DM (Invia, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA), QPET (Cedars-Sinai, Los Angeles, California, USA), and SyngoMBF (Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany). The software packages addressed Lortie tracer kinetic model and region of interest (ROI) extraction correction option.

Statistics: A repeated-measures ANOVA with a Greenhouse-Geisser correction was performed with post hoc tests using Bonferroni correction. For intersoftware variability, Pearson correlation and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were calculated. Bland-Altman assessed limit of agreement. Cohen's Kappa assessed agreement in the classification of exams as normal or abnormal using an MFR cut-off value of 2.0. A P value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results: Data from 55 patients were analyzed. The mean values of myocardial blood flow (MBF) and myocardial perfusion reserve (MFR) were statistically significantly different among the softwares (P < 0.05). Corridor4DM had considerably lower values of MFR and classified a more substantial number of exams as abnormal (MFR: 2.21 ± 0.7, 2.4 ± 0.8, and 1.98 ± 0.8; and 18, 15, and 31 exams were abnormal for Syngo, QPET, and Corridor4DM, respectively). Accordingly, kappa agreement was moderate for Syngo vs QPET (k > 0.5), but minimal for Corridor4DM in comparison to its pairs (k < 0.4).

Conclusion: Users should be cautious when using different software interchangeably as systematic differences amongst them may introduce more extensive quantitative variation which could be clinically significant.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30238299/
Preclinical evaluation of Affibody molecule for PET imaging of human pancreatic islets derived from stem cells,"Pierre Cheung, Julia Thorngren, Bo Zhang, Svitlana Vasylovska, Francesco Lechi, Jonas Persson, Stefan Ståhl, John Löfblom, Olle Korsgren, Jonas Eriksson, Joey Lau, Olof Eriksson","Background: Beta-cell replacement methods such as transplantation of isolated donor islets have been proposed as a curative treatment of type 1 diabetes, but widespread application is challenging due to shortages of donor tissue and the need for continuous immunosuppressive treatments. Stem-cell-derived islets have been suggested as an alternative source of beta cells, but face transplantation protocols optimization difficulties, mainly due to a lack of available methods and markers to directly monitor grafts survival, as well as their localization and function. Molecular imaging techniques and particularly positron emission tomography has been suggested as a tool for monitoring the fate of islets after clinical transplantation. The integral membrane protein DGCR2 has been demonstrated to be a potential pancreatic islet biomarker, with specific expression on insulin-positive human embryonic stem-cell-derived pancreatic progenitor cells. The candidate Affibody molecule ZDGCR2:AM106was radiolabeled with fluorine-18 using a novel click chemistry-based approach. The resulting positron emission tomography tracer [18F]ZDGCR2:AM106was evaluated for binding to recombinant human DGCR2 and cryosections of stem-cell-derived islets, as well as in vivo using an immune-deficient mouse model transplanted with stem-cell-derived islets. Biodistribution of the [18F]ZDGCR2:AM106was also assessed in healthy rats and pigs.

Results: [18F]ZDGCR2:AM106was successfully synthesized with high radiochemical purity and yield via a pretargeting approach. [18F]ZDGCR2:AM106retained binding to recombinant human DCGR2 as well as to cryosectioned stem-cell-derived islets, but in vivo binding to native pancreatic tissue in both rat and pig was low. However, in vivo uptake of [18F]ZDGCR2:AM106in stem-cell-derived islets transplanted in the immunodeficient mice was observed, albeit only within the early imaging frames after injection of the radiotracer.

Conclusion: Targeting of DGCR2 is a promising approach for in vivo detection of stem-cell-derived islets grafts by molecular imaging. The synthesis of [18F]ZDGCR2:AM106was successfully performed via a pretargeting method to label a site-specific covalently bonded fluorine-18 to the Affibody molecule. However, the rapid washout of [18F]ZDGCR2:AM106from the stem-cell-derived islets graft indicates that dissociation kinetics can be improved. Further studies using alternative binders of similar classes with improved binding potential are warranted.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38100042/
Efficient Distribution of a Novel Zirconium-89 Labeled Anti-cd20 Antibody Following Subcutaneous and Intravenous Administration in Control and Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis-Variant Mice,"Mary-Anne Migotto, Karine Mardon, Jacqueline Orian, Gisbert Weckbecker, Rainer Kneuer, Rajiv Bhalla, David C Reutens","Objective:To investigate the imaging and biodistribution of a novel zirconium-89 (89Zr)-labeled mouse anti-cd20 monoclonal antibody (mAb) in control and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mice following subcutaneous (s. c.) and intravenous (i.v.) administration.Background:Anti-cd20-mediated B-cell depletion using mAbs is a promising therapy for multiple sclerosis. Recombinant human myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (rhMOG)-induced EAE involves B-cell-mediated inflammation and demyelination in mice.Design/Methods:C57BL/6J mice (n= 39) were EAE-induced using rhMOG. On Day 14 post EAE induction,89Zr-labeled-anti-cd20 mAb was injected in control and EAE mice in the right lower flank (s.c.) or tail vein (i.v.). Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging and gamma counting (ex vivo) were performed on Days 1, 3, and 7 to quantify tracer accumulation in the major organs, lymphatics, and central nervous system (CNS). A preliminary study was conducted in healthy mice to elucidate full and early kinetics of the tracer that were subsequently applied in the EAE and control mice study.Results:89Zr-labeled anti-cd20 mAb was effectively absorbed from s.c. and i.v. injection sites and distributed to all major organs in the EAE and control mice. There was a good correlation betweenin vivoPET/CT data andex vivoquantification of biodistribution of the tracer. From gamma counting studies, initial tracer uptake within the lymphatic system was found to be higher in the draining lymph nodes (inguinal or subiliac and sciatic) following s.c. vs. i.v. administration; within the CNS a significantly higher tracer uptake was observed at 24 h in the cerebellum, cerebrum, and thoracic spinal cord (p< 0.05 for all) following s.c. vs. i.v. administration.Conclusions:The preclinical data suggest that initial tracer uptake was significantly higher in the draining lymph nodes (subiliac and sciatic) and parts of CNS (the cerebellum and cerebrum) when administered s.c. compared with i.v in EAE mice.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31681317/
Decreased [18F]spiperone binding in putamen in idiopathic focal dystonia,"J S Perlmutter, M K Stambuk, J Markham, K J Black, L McGee-Minnich, J Jankovic, S M Moerlein","In this study we have investigated the pathophysiology of two idiopathic focal dystonias: hand cramp with excessive cocontractions of agonist and antagonist hand or forearm muscles during specific tasks, such as writing, and facial dystonia manifested by involuntary eyelid spasms (blepharospasm) and lower facial and jaw spasms (oromandibular dystonia). We used positron emission tomography (PET) to measure the in vivo binding of the dopaminergic radioligand [18F]spiperone in putamen in 21 patients with these two focal dystonias and compared the findings with those from 13 normals. We measured regional cerebral blood flow and blood volume in each subject as well as the radiolabeled metabolites of [18F]spiperone in arterial blood. A stereotactic method of localization, independent of the appearance of the images, was used to identify the putamen in all of the PET images. We analyzed the PET and arterial blood data with a validated nonsteady-state tracer kinetic model representing the in vivo behavior of the radioligand. An index of binding called the combined forward rate constant was decreased by 29% in dystonics, as compared with normals (p < 0.05). There were no significant differences between dystonics and normals in regional blood flow, blood volume, nonspecific binding, permeability-surface area product of [18F]spiperone or the dissociation rate constant. These findings are consistent with a decrease of dopamine D2-like binding in putamen and are the first demonstration of a receptor abnormality in idiopathic dystonia. These results have important implications for the pathophysiology of dystonia as well as for function of the basal ganglia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8987805/
Evaluation of tracer kinetic models for analysis of [18F]FDDNP studies,"Maqsood Yaqub, Ronald Boellaard, Bart N M van Berckel, Nelleke Tolboom, Gert Luurtsema, Anke A Dijkstra, Mark Lubberink, Albert D Windhorst, Philip Scheltens, Adriaan A Lammertsma","Purpose: Different pharmacokinetic methods for [18F]FDDNP studies were evaluated using both simulations and clinical data.

Procedures: Methods included two-tissue reversible plasma (2T4k), simplified reference tissue input (SRTM), and a modified 2T4k models. The latter included an additional compartment for metabolites (2T1M). For plasma input models, binding potential, BP(ND), was obtained both directly (=k (3)/k (4)) and indirectly (using volume of distribution ratios).

Results: For clinical data, 2T1M was preferred over 2T4k according to Akaike criterion. Indirect BP(ND) using 2T1M correlated better with SRTM then direct BP(ND). Fairly constant volume of distribution of metabolites was found across brain and across subjects, which was strongly related to bias in BP(ND) obtained from SRTM as seen in simulations. Furthermore, in simulations, SRTM showed constant bias with best precision if metabolites entered brain.

Conclusions: SRTM is the method of choice for quantitative analysis of [18F]FDDNP even if it is unclear whether labeled metabolites enter the brain.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19340487/
"Evaluation of a bolus/infusion protocol for 11C-ABP688, a PET tracer for mGluR5","Cyrill Burger, Alexandra Deschwanden, Simon Ametamey, Anass Johayem, Bruno Mancosu, Matthias Wyss, Gregor Hasler, Alfred Buck","(11)C-ABP-688 is a selective tracer for the mGluR5 receptor. Its kinetics is fast and thus favourable for an equilibrium approach to determine receptor-related parameters. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that the pattern of the (11)C-ABP688 uptake using a bolus-plus-infusion (B/I) protocol at early time points corresponds to the perfusion and at a later time point to the total distribution volume.

Methods: A bolus and a B/I study (1 h each) was performed in five healthy male volunteers. With the B/I protocol, early and late scans were normalized to gray matter, cerebellum and white matter. The same normalization was done on the maps of the total distribution volume (Vt) and K(1) which were calculated in the study with bolus only injection and the Logan method (Vt) and a two-tissue compartment model (K(1)).

Results: There was an excellent correlation close to the identity line between the pattern of the late uptake in the B/I study and Vt of the bolus-only study for all three normalizations. The pattern of the early uptake in the B/I study correlated well with the K(1) maps, but only when normalized to gray matter and cerebellum, not to white matter.

Conclusion: It is demonstrated that with a B/I protocol the (11)C-ABP688 distribution in late scans reflects the pattern of the total distribution volume and is therefore a measure for the density pattern of mGluR5. The early scans following injection are related to blood flow, although not in a fully quantitative manner. The advantage of the B/I protocol is that no arterial blood sampling is required, which is advantageous in clinical studies.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20870160/
Bidirectional dynamic frame prediction network for total-body [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 and [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 PET images,"Qianyi Yang, Wenbo Li, Zhenxing Huang, Zixiang Chen, Wenjie Zhao, Yunlong Gao, Xinlan Yang, Yongfeng Yang, Hairong Zheng, Dong Liang, Jianjun Liu, Ruohua Chen, Zhanli Hu","Purpose: Total-body dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with total-body coverage and ultrahigh sensitivity has played an important role in accurate tracer kinetic analyses in physiology, biochemistry, and pharmacology. However, dynamic PET scans typically entail prolonged durations ([Formula: see text]60 minutes), potentially causing patient discomfort and resulting in artifacts in the final images. Therefore, we propose a dynamic frame prediction method for total-body PET imaging via deep learning technology to reduce the required scanning time.

Methods: On the basis of total-body dynamic PET data acquired from 13 subjects who received [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 (68Ga-FAPI) and 24 subjects who received [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 (68Ga-PSMA), we propose a bidirectional dynamic frame prediction network that uses the initial and final 10 min of PET imaging data (frames 1-6 and frames 25-30, respectively) as inputs. The peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index measure (SSIM) were employed as evaluation metrics for an image quality assessment. Moreover, we calculated parametric images (68Ga-FAPI: [Formula: see text],68Ga-PSMA: [Formula: see text]) based on the supplemented sequence data to observe the quantitative accuracy of our approach. Regions of interest (ROIs) and statistical analyses were utilized to evaluate the performance of the model.

Results: Both the visual and quantitative results illustrate the effectiveness of our approach. The generated dynamic PET images yielded PSNRs of 36.056 ± 0.709 dB for the68Ga-PSMA group and 33.779 ± 0.760 dB for the68Ga-FAPI group. Additionally, the SSIM reached 0.935 ± 0.006 for the68Ga-FAPI group and 0.922 ± 0.009 for the68Ga-PSMA group. By conducting a quantitative analysis on the parametric images, we obtained PSNRs of 36.155 ± 4.813 dB (68Ga-PSMA, [Formula: see text]) and 43.150 ± 4.102 dB (68Ga-FAPI, [Formula: see text]). The obtained SSIM values were 0.932 ± 0.041 (68Ga-PSMA) and 0.980 ± 0.011 (68Ga-FAPI). The ROI analysis conducted on our generated dynamic PET sequences also revealed that our method can accurately predict temporal voxel intensity changes, maintaining overall visual consistency with the ground truth.

Conclusion: In this work, we propose a bidirectional dynamic frame prediction network for total-body68Ga-PSMA and68Ga-FAPI PET imaging with a reduced scan duration. Visual and quantitative analyses demonstrated that our approach performed well when it was used to predict one-hour dynamic PET images. https://github.com/OPMZZZ/BDF-NET .",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39489859/
The transport of tyrosine into the human brain as determined with L-[1-11C]tyrosine and PET,"F A Wiesel, G Blomqvist, C Halldin, I Sjögren, L Bjerkenstedt, N Venizelos, L Hagenfeldt","An alteration of dopaminergic transmission in the brain has been proposed for schizophrenia. To explore this, the rate constant for the intransport of L-tyrosine across the blood-brain barrier in healthy controls and in patients with schizophrenia (DSM-III-R) was determined with PET and L-[1-11C] tyrosine as the tracer. Kinetics for tyrosine transport were determined according to a two-compartment model using radioactivity data of arterial blood and brain tissue sampled between 1 and 3.5 min after a bolus injection of L-[1-11C] tyrosine. Radioactivity was measured every second in the blood and in 10-sec intervals in the brain tissue. In the normal controls the brain intransport rate constant for tyrosine was 0.052 ml/g/min with an influx rate of 2.97 nmol/g/min. The patients had a similar intransport rate constant (0.045 ml/g/min) but a lower influx rate of tyrosine 1.95 nmol/g/min (p less than 0.05). The patients' tyrosine concentrations in the blood were lower. For data sampled between 5 and 25 min, the net accumulation rate of tyrosine into the brain was 0.015 ml/g/min in the controls which did not differ to the patients' rate. However, the net utilization of tyrosine was lower in the patients (0.672 nmol/g/min) than in the controls (0.883 nmol/g/min) despite similar tissue concentrations of tyrosine.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1941137/
Improved metabolic stability for 18F PET probes rapidly constructed via tetrazine trans-cyclooctene ligation,"Ramajeyam Selvaraj, Benjamin Giglio, Shuanglong Liu, Hui Wang, Mengzhe Wang, Hong Yuan, Srinivasa R Chintala, Li-Peng Yap, Peter S Conti, Joseph M Fox, Zibo Li","The fast kinetics and bioorthogonal nature of the tetrazine trans-cyclooctene (TCO) ligation makes it a unique tool for PET probe construction. In this study, we report the development of an (18)F-labeling system based on a CF3-substituted diphenyl-s-tetrazine derivative with the aim of maintaining high reactivity while increasing in vivo stability. c(RGDyK) was tagged by a CF3-substituted diphenyl-s-tetrazine derivative via EDC-mediated coupling. The resulting tetrazine-RGD conjugate was combined with a (19)F-labeled TCO derivative to give HPLC standards. The analogous (18)F-labeled TCO derivative was combined with the diphenyl-s-tetrazine-RGD at μM concentration. The resulting tracer was subjected to in vivo metabolic stability assessment, and microPET studies in murine U87MG xenograft models. The diphenyl-s-tetrazine-RGD combines with an (18)F-labeled TCO in high yields (>97% decay-corrected on the basis of TCO) using only 4 equiv of tetrazine-RGD relative to the (18)F-labeled TCO (concentration calculated based on product's specific activity). The radiochemical purity of the (18)F-RGD peptides was >95% and the specific activity was 111 GBq/μmol. Noninvasive microPET experiments demonstrated that (18)F-RGD had integrin-specific tumor uptake in subcutaneous U87MG glioma. In vivo metabolic stability of (18)F-RGD in blood, urine, and major organs showed two major peaks: one corresponded to the Diels-Alder conjugate and the other was identified as the aromatized analog. A CF3-substituted diphenyl-s-tetrazine displays excellent speed and efficiency in (18)F-PET probe construction, providing nearly quantitative (18)F labeling within minutes at low micromolar concentrations.

Amyloid-PET predicts inhibition of de novo plaque formation upon chronic γ-secretase modulator treatment,"M Brendel, A Jaworska, J Herms, J Trambauer, C Rötzer, F-J Gildehaus, J Carlsen, P Cumming, J Bylund, T Luebbers, P Bartenstein, H Steiner, C Haass, K Baumann, A Rominger","In a positron-emission tomography (PET) study with the β-amyloid (Aβ) tracer [(18)F]-florbetaben, we previously showed that Aβ deposition in transgenic mice expressing Swedish mutant APP (APP-Swe) mice can be tracked in vivo. γ-Secretase modulators (GSMs) are promising therapeutic agents by reducing generation of the aggregation prone Aβ42 species without blocking general γ-secretase activity. We now aimed to investigate the effects of a novel GSM [8-(4-Fluoro-phenyl)-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyridin-2-yl]-[1-(3-methyl-[1,2,4]thiadiazol-5-yl)-piperidin-4-yl]-amine (RO5506284) displaying high potency in vitro and in vivo on amyloid plaque burden and used longitudinal Aβ-microPET to trace individual animals. Female transgenic (TG) APP-Swe mice aged 12 months (m) were assigned to vehicle (TG-VEH, n=12) and treatment groups (TG-GSM, n=12), which received daily RO5506284 (30 mg kg(-1)) treatment for 6 months. A total of 131 Aβ-PET recordings were acquired at baseline (12 months), follow-up 1 (16 months) and follow-up 2 (18 months, termination scan), whereupon histological and biochemical analyses of Aβ were performed. We analyzed the PET data as VOI-based cortical standard-uptake-value ratios (SUVR), using cerebellum as reference region. Individual plaque load assessed by PET remained nearly constant in the TG-GSM group during 6 months of RO5506284 treatment, whereas it increased progressively in the TG-VEH group. Baseline SUVR in TG-GSM mice correlated with Δ%-SUVR, indicating individual response prediction. Insoluble Aβ42 was reduced by 56% in the TG-GSM versus the TG-VEH group relative to the individual baseline plaque load estimates. Furthermore, plaque size histograms showed differing distribution between groups of TG mice, with fewer small plaques in TG-GSM animals. Taken together, in the first Aβ-PET study monitoring prolonged treatment with a potent GSM in an AD mouse model, we found clear attenuation of de novo amyloidogenesis. Moreover, longitudinal PET allows non-invasive assessment of individual plaque-load kinetics, thereby accommodating inter-animal variations.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26055427/
PET imaging of oxidative metabolism abnormalities in sympathetically denervated canine myocardium,"G D Hutchins, T Chen, K A Carlson, R L Fain, W Winkle, T Vavrek, B H Mock, D P Zipes","This study was designed to test the hypothesis that regional sympathetic denervation produces perfusion and metabolic alterations in myocardial tissue under resting conditions.

Methods: PET studies of myocardial sympathetic innervation, myocardial perfusion and oxygen utilization using [11C]hydroxyephedrine (HED), [13N]ammonia and 1-[11C]acetate, respectively, were performed before and approximately 2 and 8 wk after surgical left thoracotomy and regional chemical sympathetic denervation (n = 5). A second group of animals underwent the same surgical procedure but, so that they could serve as a sham control group, were not sympathetically denervated (n = 5). The second group of animals was imaged before and 2 wk after surgery. Images of the retention of [11C]HED taken from 50 to 60 min postinjection were used to differentiate sympathetically innervated and denervated regions of the left ventricle. Regions of interest were defined on polar plots of the [11C]HED retention, including the sympathetically denervated territory and normally innervated regions. Regions defined on the HED polar plots were then transferred to the [13N]ammonia and 1-[11C]acetate image data, and tracer kinetic models were fit to the regional time-activity curves to generate estimates of myocardial perfusion and oxidative metabolism.

Results: The average percentage of the left ventricle denervated in the group I animals was 13.1% +/- 7.3%. Significant reductions in oxidative metabolism were observed in the sympathectomized tissue both at 2 and 8 wk after surgery (22% and 15% reductions, respectively). Significant alterations in regional perfusion were not observed. No significant changes in oxidative metabolism or perfusion were observed in the sham control group.

Conclusion: Regional sympathetic denervation alters oxidative metabolism but not perfusion in the denervated region of the heart.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10319760/
"Evaluating the immunologically ""cold"" tumor microenvironment after treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors utilizing PET imaging of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells in breast cancer mouse models","Yun Lu, Hailey A Houson, Carlos A Gallegos, Alessandro Mascioni, Fang Jia, Argin Aivazian, Patrick N Song, Shannon E Lynch, Tiara S Napier, Ameer Mansur, Benjamin M Larimer, Suzanne E Lapi, Ariella B Hanker, Anna G Sorace","Background: Immune-positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with tracers that target CD8 and granzyme B has shown promise in predicting the therapeutic response following immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) in immunologically ""hot"" tumors. However, immune dynamics in the low T-cell infiltrating ""cold"" tumor immune microenvironment during ICB remain poorly understood. This study uses molecular imaging to evaluate changes in CD4 + T cells and CD8 + T cells during ICB in breast cancer models and examines biomarkers of response.

Methods: [89Zr]Zr-DFO-CD4 and [89Zr]Zr-DFO-CD8 radiotracers were used to quantify changes in intratumoral and splenic CD4 T cells and CD8 T cells in response to ICB treatment in 4T1 and MMTV-HER2 mouse models, which represent immunologically ""cold"" tumors. A correlation between PET quantification metrics and long-term anti-tumor response was observed. Further biological validation was obtained by autoradiography and immunofluorescence.

Results: Following ICB treatment, an increase in the CD8-specific PET signal was observed within 6 days, and an increase in the CD4-specific PET signal was observed within 2 days in tumors that eventually responded to immunotherapy, while no significant differences in CD4 or CD8 were found at the baseline of treatment that differentiated responders from nonresponders. Furthermore, mice whose tumors responded to ICB had a lower CD8 PET signal in the spleen and a higher CD4 PET signal in the spleen compared to non-responders. Intratumoral spatial heterogeneity of the CD8 and CD4-specific PET signals was lower in responders compared to non-responders. Finally, PET imaging, autoradiography, and immunofluorescence signals were correlated when comparing in vivo imaging to ex vivo validations.

Conclusions: CD4- and CD8-specific immuno-PET imaging can be used to characterize the in vivo distribution of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells in response to immune checkpoint blockade. Imaging metrics that describe the overall levels and distribution of CD8 + T cells and CD4 + T cells can provide insight into immunological alterations, predict biomarkers of response to immunotherapy, and guide clinical decision-making in those tumors where the kinetics of the response differ.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38918836/
Development of Carbon-11 Labeled Pyrimidine Derivatives as Novel Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Agents Enabling Brain Sigma-1 Receptor Imaging,"Ping Bai, Ashley Gomm, Chi-Hyeon Yoo, Prasenjit Mondal, Fleur Marie Lobo, Hui Meng, Yanting Zhou, Weiyao Xie, Hsiao-Ying Wey, Rudolph E Tanzi, Can Zhang, Changning Wang, Yu Lan","The sigma-1 receptor (σ1R) is a stress-activated chaperone protein that has emerged as a significant therapeutic target for neurodegenerative disorders. Developing effective positron emission tomography (PET) imaging probes targeting σ1R is crucial for visualizing its distribution and function in the brain, as well as facilitating related drug development. In this study, two novel11C-labeled PET probes based on the structure of a potent σ1R ligand Lan-0101 are designed and synthesized. PET imaging studies in mice reveal that [11C]CNY-01 exhibits good brain uptake and binding specificity. Subsequent evaluation in non-human primates further demonstrates that [11C]CNY-01 displays favorable brain penetration, slow clearance kinetics, and characteristics of irreversible binding to its target in blockage experiments. To assess the clinical potential of the probe, both in vitro experiments and in vivo PET imaging using [11C]CNY-01 are conducted in Alzheimer's disease (AD) transgenic mouse models. These studies reveal a significant decrease in σ1R expression in the brain under conditions of AD amyloid pathology and microglial activation, highlighting the probe's sensitivity to disease-related receptor changes. This work establishes [11C]CNY-01 as a promising tool for investigating the relationship between σ1R and neurological disorders, potentially advancing the understanding of σ1R's role in disease pathophysiology and therapeutic interventions.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40245194/
"Quantification of Macrophage-Driven Inflammation During Myocardial Infarction with 18F-LW223, a Novel TSPO Radiotracer with Binding Independent of the rs6971 Human Polymorphism","Mark G MacAskill, Agne Stadulyte, Lewis Williams, Timaeus E F Morgan, Nikki L Sloan, Carlos J Alcaide-Corral, Tashfeen Walton, Catriona Wimberley, Chris-Anne McKenzie, Nick Spath, William Mungall, Ralph BouHaidar, Marc R Dweck, Gillian A Gray, David E Newby, Christophe Lucatelli, Andrew Sutherland, Sally L Pimlott, Adriana A S Tavares","Myocardial infarction (MI) is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, and inflammation is central to tissue response and patient outcomes. The 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO) has been used in PET as an inflammatory biomarker. The aims of this study were to screen novel, fluorinated, TSPO radiotracers for susceptibility to the rs6971 genetic polymorphism using in vitro competition binding assays in human brain and heart; assess whether the in vivo characteristics of our lead radiotracer,18F-LW223, are suitable for clinical translation; and validate whether18F-LW223 can detect macrophage-driven inflammation in a rat MI model.Methods:Fifty-one human brain and 29 human heart tissue samples were screened for the rs6971 polymorphism. Competition binding assays were conducted with3H-PK11195 and the following ligands: PK11195, PBR28, and our novel compounds (AB5186 and LW223). Naïve rats and mice were used for in vivo PET kinetic studies, radiometabolite studies, and dosimetry experiments. Rats underwent permanent coronary artery ligation and were scanned using PET/CT with an invasive input function at 7 d after MI. For quantification of PET signal in the hypoperfused myocardium,K1(rate constant for transfer from arterial plasma to tissues) was used as a surrogate marker of perfusion to correct the binding potential for impaired radiotracer transfer from plasma to tissue (BPTC).Results:LW223 binding to TSPO was not susceptible to the rs6971 genetic polymorphism in human brain and heart samples. In rodents,18F-LW223 displayed a specific uptake consistent with TSPO expression, a slow metabolism in blood (69% of parent at 120 min), a high plasma free fraction of 38.5%, and a suitable dosimetry profile (effective dose of 20.5-24.5 μSv/MBq).18F-LW223 BPTCwas significantly higher in the MI cohort within the infarct territory of the anterior wall relative to the anterior wall of naïve animals (32.7 ± 5.0 vs. 10.0 ± 2.4 cm3/mL/min,P≤ 0.001). Ex vivo immunofluorescent staining for TSPO and CD68 (macrophage marker) resulted in the same pattern seen with in vivo BPTCanalysis.Conclusion:18F-LW223 is not susceptible to the rs6971 genetic polymorphism in in vitro assays, has favorable in vivo characteristics, and is able to accurately map macrophage-driven inflammation after MI.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32859708/
[N-methyl 11C]meta-Hydroxyephedrine positron emission tomography in Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy,"Georg Berding, Christoph H Schrader, Thomas Peschel, Jörg van den Hoff, Hans Kolbe, Geerd J Meyer, Reinhard Dengler, Wolfram H Knapp","Orthostatic hypotension (OH) can be present in idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) as well as in atypical parkinsonian syndromes such as multiple system atrophy (MSA). According to clinical tests of sympathetic nerve function and histopathological data, OH is caused by primarily postganglionic sympathetic dysfunction in IPD and by predominantly central and preganglionic degeneration in MSA. It has been proposed that this concept of a different underlying pathogenesis for OH should be applied in the differential diagnosis of parkinsonian disorders, in the form of measurements of sympathetic myocardial innervation. In this pilot study, myocardial imaging with [ N-methyl (11)C]meta-hydroxyephedrine ((11)C-HED) and positron emission tomography (PET) was used as a quantitative tool to evaluate the feasibility of such an approach. Seven patients were included in the study. Two had MSA and OH, three had probable IPD and OH (duration of disease, >3 years), one had probable IPD without OH (disease duration, 3 years) and one had possible IPD without OH (disease duration, 2 years). Ratios of maximal (11)C-HED uptake in the myocardium to that in the liver at 5 and 40 min post injection (p.i.) and - based on kinetic modelling - tracer influx rates K(1) were calculated. Compared with MSA patients ( n=2), IPD patients with OH ( n=3) showed definitely lower uptake ratios at both 5 min p.i. (0.39-0.57 vs 0.78-0.79) and 40 min p.i. (0.21-0.60 vs 0.89-1.06), as well as lower K(1) values (0.198-0.359 vs 0.384-0.450 min(-1)). The patient with probable IPD without OH showed intermediate values (uptake ratio at 5 min: 0.65; uptake ratio at 40 min: 0.87; K(1)=0.363). In the patient with possible IPD, values (uptake ratio at 5 min: 0.96; uptake ratio at 40 min: 1.04; K(1)=0.400) did not differ from those observed in MSA. These results support the hypothesis that measurement of myocardial innervation may contribute to the differential diagnosis of parkinsonian disorders and suggest a need for quantitative pathophysiological imaging, particularly at early stages of disease.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12483420/
A novel neutrophil-specific PET imaging agent: cFLFLFK-PEG-64Cu,"Landon W Locke, Mahendra D Chordia, Yi Zhang, Bijoy Kundu, Dylan Kennedy, Jessica Landseadel, Li Xiao, Karen D Fairchild, Stuart S Berr, Joel Linden, Dongfeng Pan","The synthesis and validation of a new, highly potent (64)Cu-labeled peptide, cFLFLFK-PEG-(64)Cu, that targets the formyl peptide receptor (FPR) on leukocytes is described. The peptide ligand is an antagonist of the FPR, designed not to elicit a chemotactic response resulting in neutropenia. Evidence for the selective binding of this synthesized ligand to neutrophils is provided. PET properties of the compound were evaluated in a mouse model of lung inflammation.

Methods: The FPR-specific peptide, cinnamoyl-F-(D)L-F-(D)L-FK (cFLFLF), was sequentially conjugated with a bifunctional polyethylene glycol moiety (PEG, 3.4 kD) and a 2,2',2'',2'''-(1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetrayl)tetraacetic acid (DOTA) through a lysine (K) spacer and finally labeled with (64)Cu-CuCl(2) to form cFLFLFK-PEG-(64)Cu. The binding affinity and stimulation potency of the ligand toward human neutrophils were assessed in vitro. Blood kinetic and organ biodistribution properties of the peptide were studied in the mouse. Ten male C57BL/6 mice were used in this study; 4 control mice and 6 administered Klebsiella pneumonia. PET/CT scans were performed to assess the localization properties of the labeled peptide in lungs 18 h after tracer administration. Lung standardized uptake values (SUVs) were correlated with lung neutrophil activity as measured by myeloperoxidase assays. Immunohistochemistry was performed to confirm that neutrophils constitute the majority of infiltrating leukocytes in lung tissue 24 h after Klebsiella exposure.

Results: In vitro binding assays of the compound cFLFLFK-PEG-(64)Cu to the neutrophil FPR yielded a dissociation constant of 17.7 nM. The functional superoxide stimulation assay exhibited negligible agonist activity of the ligand with respect to neutrophil superoxide production. The pegylated peptide ligand exhibited a blood clearance half-life of 55 +/- 8 min. PET 18 h after tracer administration revealed mean lung SUVs and lung myeloperoxidase activities for Klebsiella-infected mice that were 5- and 6-fold higher, respectively, than those for control mice. Immunohistochemistry staining confirmed that the cellular infiltrate in lungs of Klebsiella-infected mice was almost exclusively neutrophils at the time of imaging.

Conclusion: This new radiolabeled peptide targeting the FPR binds to neutrophils in vitro and accumulates at sites of inflammation in vivo. This modified peptide may prove to be a useful tool to probe inflammation or injury.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19372473/
Dynamic contrast-enhanced computed tomography to assess early activity of cetuximab in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck,"Sandra Schmitz, Denis Rommel, Nicolas Michoux, Renaud Lhommel, François-Xavier Hanin, Thierry Duprez, Jean-Pascal Machiels","Background: Cetuximab, a monoclonal antibody targeting the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR), has demonstrated activity in various tumor types. Using dynamic contrast-enhanced computed tomography (DCE-CT), we investigated the early activity of cetuximab monotherapy in previously untreated patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN).

Methods: Treatment-naïve patients with SCCHN received cetuximab for 2 weeks before curative surgery. Treatment activity was evaluated by DCE-CT at baseline and before surgery. Tumor vascular and interstitial characteristics were evaluated using the Brix two-compartment kinetic model. Modifications of the perfusion parameters (blood flow Fp, extravascular space ve, vascular space vp, and transfer constant PS) were assessed between both time points. DCE data were compared to FDG-PET and histopathological examination obtained simultaneously. Plasmatic vascular markers were investigated at different time points.

Results: Fourteen patients had evaluable DCE-CT parameters at both time points. A significant increase in the extravascular extracellular space ve accessible to the tracer was observed but no significant differences were found for the other kinetic parameters (Fp, vp or PS). Significant correlations were found between DCE parameters and the other two modalities. Plasmatic VEGF, PDGF-BB and IL-8 decreased as early as 2 hours after cetuximab infusion.

Conclusions: Early activity of cetuximab on tumor interstitial characteristics was detected by DCE-CT. Modifications of plasmatic vascular markers are not sufficient to confirm anti-angiogenic cetuximab activity in vivo. Further investigation is warranted to determine to what extent DCE-CT parameters are modified and to evaluate whether they are able to predict treatment outcome.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25810697/

Data-Driven Motion Detection and Event-by-Event Correction for Brain PET: Comparison with Vicra,"Yihuan Lu, Mika Naganawa, Takuya Toyonaga, Jean-Dominique Gallezot, Kathryn Fontaine, Silin Ren, Enette Mae Revilla, Tim Mulnix, Richard E Carson","Head motion degrades image quality and causes erroneous parameter estimates in tracer kinetic modeling in brain PET studies. Existing motion correction methods include frame-based image registration (FIR) and correction using real-time hardware-based motion tracking (HMT) information. However, FIR cannot correct for motion within 1 predefined scan period, and HMT is not readily available in the clinic since it typically requires attaching a tracking device to the patient. In this study, we propose a motion correction framework with a data-driven algorithm, that is, using the PET raw data itself, to address these limitations.Methods:We propose a data-driven algorithm, centroid of distribution (COD), to detect head motion. In COD, the central coordinates of the line of response of all events are averaged over 1-s intervals to generate a COD trace. A point-to-point change in the COD trace in 1 direction that exceeded a user-defined threshold was defined as a time point of head motion, which was followed by manually adding additional motion time points. All the frames defined by such time points were reconstructed without attenuation correction and rigidly registered to a reference frame. The resulting transformation matrices were then used to perform the final motion-compensated reconstruction. We applied the new COD framework to 23 human dynamic datasets, all containing large head motion, with18F-FDG (n= 13) and11C-UCB-J ((R)-1-((3-(11C-methyl-11C)pyridin-4-yl)methyl)-4-(3,4,5-trifluorophenyl)pyrrolidin-2-one) (n= 10) and compared its performance with FIR and with HMT using Vicra (an optical HMT device), which can be considered the gold standard.Results:The COD method yielded a 1.0% ± 3.2% (mean ± SD across all subjects and 12 gray matter regions) SUV difference for18F-FDG (3.7% ± 5.4% for11C-UCB-J) compared with HMT, whereas no motion correction (NMC) and FIR yielded -15.7% ± 12.2% (-20.5% ± 15.8%) and -4.7% ± 6.9% (-6.2% ± 11.0%), respectively. For18F-FDG dynamic studies, COD yielded differences of 3.6% ± 10.9% inKivalue as compared with HMT, whereas NMC and FIR yielded -18.0% ± 39.2% and -2.6% ± 19.8%, respectively. For11C-UCB-J, COD yielded 3.7% ± 5.2% differences inVTcompared with HMT, whereas NMC and FIR yielded -20.0% ± 12.5% and -5.3% ± 9.4%, respectively.Conclusion:The proposed COD-based data-driven motion correction method outperformed FIR and achieved comparable or even better performance than the Vicra HMT method in both static and dynamic studies.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32005770/
"Novel ""bi-modal"" H2dedpa derivatives for radio- and fluorescence imaging","Caterina F Ramogida, Lisa Murphy, Jacqueline F Cawthray, James D Ross, Michael J Adam, Chris Orvig","A novel pyridyl functionalized analog of the promising hexadentate68Ga3+chelate H2dedpa (N4O2, 1,2-[[6-carboxy-pyridin-2-yl]-methylamine]ethane) was successfully synthesized and characterized. This new bifunctional chelate (BFC) was used to prepare the first proof-of-principle bi-modal H2dedpa derivative for fluorescence and nuclear imaging. Two bi-modal H2dedpa derivatives were prepared: H2dedpa-propylpyr-FITC and H2dedpa-propylpyr-FITC-(N,N'-propyl-2-NI) (FITC=fluorescein, pyr=pyridyl functionalized, NI=nitroimidazole). The ligands possess the strong gallium-coordinating atoms contained within dedpa2-that are ideal for radiolabeling with68Ga3+for positron-emission tomography (PET) imaging, and two fluorophores for optical imaging. In addition, one analog contains two NI moieties for specific entrapment of the tracer in hypoxic cells. These new bi-modal analogs were compared to the native unfunctionalized H2dedpa scaffold to determine the extent to which the addition of pyridyl functionalization would affect metal coordination, and complex stability. The non-radioactive gallium complexes were tested in a 3D tumor spheroid model. The novel pyridyl bis-functionalized H2dedpa ligand, H2dedpa-propylpyr-NH2, was quantitatively radiolabeled with67Ga (RCY>99%) under reaction conditions commensurate with unfunctionalized H2dedpa (10min at room temperature) at ligand concentrations as low as 10-5M. The resultant67Ga-complex withstood transchelation to the in vivo metal-binding competitor apo-transferrin (2h at 37°C, 93% intact), signifying that [Ga(dedpa-propylpyr-NH2)]+is a kinetically inert complex suitable for in vivo use, but exhibited slightly reduced stability compared to the native [67Ga(dedpa)] scaffold (>99% intact). Finally, bi-model fluorescent Ga-dedpa compounds were successfully imaged in a 3D tumor spheroid model.

Although it is detected by18F-fluoromisonidazole (FMISO) PET, the relationship between intratumoral hypoxia and oxygen metabolism has not been studied. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the intratumoral perfusion and oxygen metabolism in hypoxic regions using the rat xenograft model. Ten male Fischer rats with C6 glioma (body weight = 220 ± 15 g) were investigated with18F-FMISO PET and steady-state inhalation method of15O-labelled gases PET. The tumoral blood flow (TBF), tumoral metabolic rate of oxygen (TMRO2), oxygen extraction fraction (OEF), and tumoral blood volume (TBV) were measured under artificial ventilation with15O-CO2,15O-O2, and15O-CO gases. Multiple volumes of interest (1-mm diameter sphere) were placed on the co-registered18F-FMISO (3 h post injection) and functional15O-labelled gases PET images. The TBF, TMRO2, OEF, and TBV values were compared among the three groups classified by the18F-FMISO uptake as follows: group Low (L), less than 1.0; group Medium (M), between 1.0 and 2.0; and group High (H), more than 2.0 in the18F-FMISO standardized uptake value (SUV).

Results: There were moderate negative correlations between18F-FMISO SUV and TBF (r = -0.56 and p < 0.01), and weak negative correlations between18F-FMISO SUV and TMRO2(r = -0.38 and p < 0.01) and18F-FMISO SUV and TBV (r = -0.38 and p < 0.01). Quantitative values were as follows: TBF, (L) 55 ± 30, (M) 32 ± 17, and (H) 30 ± 15 mL/100 mL/min; OEF, (L) 33 ± 14, (M) 36 ± 17, and (H) 41 ± 16%; TMRO2, (L) 2.8 ± 1.3, (M) 1.9 ± 1.0, and (H) 2.1 ± 1.1 mL/100 mL/min; and TBV, (L) 5.7 ± 2.1, (M) 4.3 ± 1.9, and (H) 3.9 ± 1.2 mL/100 mL, respectively. Intratumoral hypoxic regions (M and H) showed significantly lower TBF, TMRO2, and TBV values than non-hypoxic regions (L). OEF showed significant increase in the severe hypoxic region compared to non-hypoxic and mild hypoxic regions.

Experiment assessment of mass effects in the rat: implications for small animal PET imaging,"E M Jagoda, J J Vaquero, J Seidel, M V Green, W C Eckelman","In vivo imaging using positron emission tomography (PET) is important in the development of new radiopharmaceuticals in rodent animal models for use as biochemical probes, diagnostic agents, or in drug development. We have shown mathematically that, if small animal imaging studies in rodents are to have the same ""quality"" as human PET studies, the same number of coincidence events must be detected from a typical rodent imaging ""voxel"" as from the human imaging voxel. To achieve this using the same specific activity preparation, we show that roughly the same total amount of radiopharmaceutical must be given to a rodent as to a human subject. At high specific activities, the mass associated with human doses, when administered to a rodent, may not decrease the uptake of radioactivity at non saturable sites or sites where an enzyme has a high capacity for a substrate. However, in the case of binding sites of low density such as receptors, the increased mass injected could saturate the receptor and lead to physiologic effects and non-linear kinetics. Because of the importance of the mass injected for small animal PET imaging, we experimentally compared high and low mass preparations using ex vivo biodistribution and phosphorimaging of three compounds: 2-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG), 6-fluoro-L-metatyrosine (FMT) and one receptor-directed compound, the serotonin 5HT1A receptor ligand, trans-4-fluoro-N-[2-[4-(2-methoxylphenyl) piperazino]ethyl]-N-(2-pyridyl) cyclohexane- carboxamide (FCWAY). Changes in the mass injected per rat did not affect the distribution of FDG, FMT, and FCWAY in the range of 0.6-1.9 nmol per rat. Changes in the target to nontarget ratio were observed for injected masses of FCWAY in the range of approximately 5-50 nmol per rat. If the specific activity of such compounds and/or the sensitivity of small animal scanners are not increased relative to human studies, small animal PET imaging will not correctly portray the ""true"" tracer distribution. These difficulties will only be exacerbated in animals smaller than the rat, e.g., mice.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15246368/
PET imaging of monoamine oxidase B in peripheral organs in humans,"Joanna S Fowler, Jean Logan, Gene-Jack Wang, Nora D Volkow, Wei Zhu, Dinko Franceschi, Naomi Pappas, Richard Ferrieri, Colleen Shea, Victor Garza, Youwen Xu, Robert R MacGregor, David Schlyer, S John Gatley, Yu-Shin Ding, David Alexoff","Monoamine oxidase (MAO) regulates neurotransmitter concentration in the brain and is also an important detoxifying enzyme in peripheral organs. It occurs in 2 subtypes, MAO A and MAO B. Their relative ratios in different organs are variable, depending on the particular organ and species, making it difficult to extrapolate measures from animals to humans. The purpose of this study was to investigate the feasibility of imaging MAO B in peripheral organs in humans with PET.

Methods: Nine healthy subjects (7 males, 2 females; mean age +/- SD, 37 +/- 7 y) received 2 dynamic PET studies of the torso area 2 h apart with 11C-L-deprenyl and deuterium-substituted 11C-L-deprenyl (11C-L-deprenyl-D2). Time-activity curves for heart, lungs, liver, kidneys, and spleen and arterial plasma input were measured for each study. The uptake at plateau and the incorporation quotient (IQ = uptake/plasma input) as well as model terms K1 (which is a function of blood flow) and k3 and lambdak3 (which are kinetic terms proportional to MAO B) were compared to identify organs that showed reduced values with deuterium substitution (deuterium isotope effect) characteristic of MAO B. In addition, a sensitivity analysis compared the 2 tracers with respect to their ability to quantify MAO B.

Results: Heart, lungs, kidneys, and spleen showed a robust deuterium isotope effect on uptake, IQ, k3, and lambdak3. The arterial plasma input function was significantly larger for 11C-L-deprenyl-D2 than for 11C-L-deprenyl. Liver time-activity curves were not affected by deuterium substitution and model terms could not be estimated. In organs showing an isotope effect, lambdak3 showed the rank order: kidneys >or= heart > lungs = spleen. A sensitivity analysis showed that 11C-L-deprenyl-D2 is a better index of MAO activity than 11C-L-deprenyl.

Conclusion: This study demonstrates that (a) the deuterium isotope effect is useful in assessing the binding specificity of labeled deprenyl to peripheral MAO B; (b) MAO B can be visualized and quantified in the heart, lungs, kidneys, and spleen but not in the liver; (c) with the exception of the liver, which cannot be measured, MAO B activity is highest in the kidneys and heart; and (d) quantitation in organs having high levels of MAO B is improved by the use of 11C-L-deprenyl-D2, similar to prior studies on the brain. This study indicates that 11C-L-deprenyl-D2 will be useful for measuring the effects of different variables, including tobacco smoke exposure on MAO B activity in peripheral organs in humans.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12368371/
A prospective study of risedronate on regional bone metabolism and blood flow at the lumbar spine measured by 18F-fluoride positron emission tomography,"Michelle L Frost, Gary J R Cook, Glen M Blake, Paul K Marsden, Nigel A Benatar, Ignac Fogelman","The effect of risedronate on bone metabolism at the lumbar spine was assessed in 18 women who had a 18F-fluoride PET scan at baseline and after 6 months of therapy. The net plasma clearance of fluoride to bone mineral reflecting osteoblastic activity decreased significantly after therapy.

Introduction: Quantitative radionuclide studies of bone reflect bone blood flow and regional osteoblastic activity, and the latter should change after treatment with a bisphosphonate, although this has not been previously demonstrated. The aim of this study was to examine regional 18F-fluoride kinetics in the lumbar spine measured by 18F-fluoride positron emission tomography (PET) before and after treatment with risedronate.

Materials and methods: Eighteen women, with a mean age of 67.0 years and a T-score of less than -2 at the spine or hip, had a dynamic PET scan of the lumbar spine after the injection of 90 MBq 18F-fluoride ion at baseline and 6 months after commencing risedronate therapy. The arterial plasma input function was derived using aorta arterial activity from the PET image. Time-activity curves were measured by placing regions of interest over the lumbar vertebrae. A three-compartmental model was used to calculate bone blood flow (K(1)) and the net plasma clearance of tracer to bone mineral (K(i)). Rate constants k(2), k(3), and k(4), which describe transport between plasma, the extracellular fluid (ECF) compartment, and the bone mineral compartment, respectively, were also measured.

Results: Mean vertebral K(i) decreased significantly by 18.4% from baseline (3.32 x 10(-2) ml/min/ml) to 6 months post-treatment (2.71 x 10(-2) ml/min/ml; p = 0.04). This decrease was similar in magnitude to the decrease observed for bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, a marker of bone formation. There was no significant difference in K(1) from baseline (1.49 x 10(-1) ml/min/ml) to 6 months after treatment (1.38 x 10(-1) ml/min/ml; p > 0.05). There was a significant increase in k(2), reflecting the reverse transport of fluoride from the extravascular tissue compartment to plasma, after 6 months of treatment (2.90 x 10(-1)/min versus 4.43 x 10(-1)/min; p = 0.01). No significant changes were seen for k(3) or k(4). There was a significant decrease from baseline in the fraction of tracer in the extravascular tissue space that underwent specific binding to the bone matrix (k(3)/[k(2) + k(3)]), decreasing by 18.1% (p = 0.02).

Conclusion: K(i), the net plasma clearance to bone mineral reflecting regional osteoblastic activity, displayed a significant decrease after 6 months of antiresorptive therapy. This is the first study to show a direct metabolic effect of antiresorptive therapy on skeletal kinetics at the clinically important site of the lumbar spine. The use of 18F-fluoride PET may provide a useful noninvasive tool to assess novel treatments currently being developed for osteoporosis.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14672357/
Metabolic Subtyping of Pheochromocytoma and Paraganglioma by 18F-FDG Pharmacokinetics Using Dynamic PET/CT Scanning,"Anouk van Berkel, Dennis Vriens, Eric P Visser, Marcel J R Janssen, Martin Gotthardt, Ad R M M Hermus, Lioe-Fee de Geus-Oei, Henri J L M Timmers","Static single-time-frame18F-FDG PET/CT is useful for the localization and functional characterization of pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas (PPGLs).18F-FDG uptake varies between PPGLs with different genotypes, and the highest SUVs are observed in cases of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) mutations, possibly related to enhanced aerobic glycolysis in tumor cells. The exact determinants of18F-FDG accumulation in PPGLs are unknown. We performed dynamic PET/CT scanning to assess whether in vivo18F-FDG pharmacokinetics has added value over static PET to distinguish different genotypes.Methods:Dynamic18F-FDG PET/CT was performed on 13 sporadic PPGLs and 13 PPGLs from 11 patients with mutations inSDHcomplex subunits B and D, von Hippel-Lindau (VHL),RET,and neurofibromin 1 (NF1). Pharmacokinetic analysis was performed using a 2-tissue-compartment tracer kinetic model. The derived transfer rate-constants for transmembranous glucose flux (K1[in],k2[out]) and intracellular phosphorylation (k3), along with the vascular blood fraction (Vb), were analyzed using nonlinear regression analysis. Glucose metabolic rate (MRglc) was calculated using Patlak linear regression analysis. The SUVmaxof the lesions was determined on additional static PET/CT images.Results:Both MRglcand SUVmaxwere significantly higher for hereditary cluster 1 (SDHx, VHL) tumors than for hereditary cluster 2 (RET, NF1) and sporadic tumors (P< 0.01 andP< 0.05, respectively). Mediank3was significantly higher for cluster 1 than for sporadic tumors (P< 0.01). Median Vbwas significantly higher for cluster 1 than for cluster 2 tumors (P< 0.01). No statistically significant differences inK1andk2were found between the groups. Cutoffs fork3to distinguish between cluster 1 and other tumors were established at 0.015 min-1(100% sensitivity, 15.8% specificity) and 0.636 min-1(100% specificity, 85.7% sensitivity). MRglcsignificantly correlated with SUVmax(P= 0.001) andk3(P= 0.002).Conclusion:In vivo metabolic tumor profiling in patients with PPGL can be achieved by assessing18F-FDG pharmacokinetics using dynamic PET/CT scanning. Cluster 1 PPGLs can be reliably identified by a high18F-FDG phosphorylation rate.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30413658/
L-type amino acid transporters LAT1 and LAT4 in cancer: uptake of 3-O-methyl-6-18F-fluoro-L-dopa in human adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma in vitro and in vivo,"Cathleen Haase, Ralf Bergmann, Frank Fuechtner, Alexander Hoepping, Jens Pietzsch","Expression of system L amino acid transporters (LAT) is strongly increased in many types of tumor cells. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate that (18)F-labeled amino acids, for example, 3-O-methyl-6-(18)F-fluoro-L-dopa ((18)F-OMFD), that accumulate in tumors via LAT represent an important class of imaging agents for visualization of tumors in vivo by PET.

Methods: (18)F-OMFD uptake kinetics, transport inhibition, and system L messenger RNA expression were studied in vitro in human adenocarcinoma (HT-29), squamous cell carcinoma (FaDu), macrophages (THP-1), and primary aortic endothelial cells (HAEC) and in vivo in the corresponding mouse tumor xenograft models.

Results: Uptake of (18)F-OMFD in all cell lines tested was mediated mainly by the sodium-independent high-capacity LAT. We found higher uptake in FaDu cells (V(max), 10.6 +/- 1.1 nmol/min x mg of cell protein) and in the corresponding FaDu tumor xenografts than in the other cells and corresponding xenograft models studied. Quantitative messenger RNA analysis revealed that tumor cells and xenografts have a higher expression of LAT1 than do HAEC and THP-1 macrophages. However, only in the FaDu tumor model did an increased (18)F-OMFD uptake seem to be explained by increased LAT expression. Furthermore, we demonstrated a high expression of LAT4, a recently identified LAT.

Conclusion: Our findings support the hypothesis that (18)F-OMFD is a tracer for visualization of tumor cells. (18)F-OMFD particularly seems to be a suitable tracer for diagnostic imaging of amino acid transport in poorly differentiated squamous cell head and neck carcinoma with increased LAT1 and LAT4 expression.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18056335/
Fibroblast activation protein targeted therapy using [177Lu]FAPI-46 compared with [225Ac]FAPI-46 in a pancreatic cancer model,"Yuwei Liu, Tadashi Watabe, Kazuko Kaneda-Nakashima, Yoshifumi Shirakami, Sadahiro Naka, Kazuhiro Ooe, Atsushi Toyoshima, Kojiro Nagata, Uwe Haberkorn, Clemens Kratochwil, Atsushi Shinohara, Jun Hatazawa, Frederik Giesel","Purpose: Fibroblast activation protein (FAP), which has high expression in cancer-associated fibroblasts of epithelial cancers, can be used as a theranostic target. Our previous study used64Cu and225Ac-labelled FAP inhibitors (FAPI-04) for a FAP-expressing pancreatic cancer xenograft imaging and therapy. However, the optimal therapeutic radionuclide for FAPI needs to be investigated further. In this study, we evaluated the therapeutic effects of beta-emitter (177Lu)-labelled FAPI-46 and alpha-emitter (225Ac)-labelled FAPI-46 in pancreatic cancer models.

Methods: PET scans (1 h post injection) were acquired in PANC-1 xenograft mice (n = 9) after the administration of [18F]FAPI-74 (12.4 ± 1.7 MBq) for the companion imaging. The biodistribution of [177Lu]FAPI-46 and [225Ac]FAPI-46 were evaluated in the xenograft model (total n = 12). For the determination of treatment effects, [177Lu]FAPI-46 and [225Ac]FAPI-46 were injected into PANC-1 xenograft mice at different doses: 3 MBq (n = 6), 10 MBq (n = 6), 30 MBq (n = 6), control (n = 4) for [177Lu]FAPI-46, and 3 kBq (n = 3), 10 kBq (n = 2), 30 kBq (n = 6), control (n = 7) for [225Ac]FAPI-46. Tumour sizes and body weights were followed.

Results: [18F]FAPI-74 showed rapid clearance by the kidneys and high accumulation in the tumour and intestine 1 h after administration. [177Lu]FAPI-46 and [225Ac]FAPI-46 also showed rapid clearance by the kidneys and relatively high accumulation in the tumour at 3 h. Both [177Lu]FAPI-46 and [225Ac]FAPI-46 showed tumour-suppressive effects, with a mild decrease in body weight. The treatment effects of [177Lu]FAPI-46 were relatively slow but lasted longer than those of [225Ac]FAPI-46.

Conclusion: This study suggested the possible application of FAPI radioligand therapy in FAP-expressing pancreatic cancer. Further evaluation is necessary to find the best radionuclide with shorter half-life, as well as the combination with therapies targeting tumour cells directly.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34537893/
Pharmacokinetic analysis and uptake of 18F-FBPA-Fr after ultrasound-induced blood-brain barrier disruption for potential enhancement of boron delivery for neutron capture therapy,"Feng-Yi Yang, Wen-Yuan Chang, Jia-Je Li, Hsin-Ell Wang, Jyh-Cheng Chen, Chi-Wei Chang","Boronophenylalanine has been applied in clinical boron neutron capture therapy for the treatment of high-grade gliomas. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of 4-borono-2-(18)F-fluoro-L-phenylalanine-fructose ((18)F-FBPA-Fr) in F98 glioma-bearing Fischer 344 rats by means of intravenous injection of (18)F-FBPA-Fr both with and without blood-brain barrier disruption (BBB-D) induced by focused ultrasound (FUS).

Methods: Dynamic PET imaging of (18)F-FBPA-Fr was performed on the ninth day after tumor implantation. Blood samples were collected to obtain an arterial input function for tracer kinetic modeling. Ten animals were scanned for approximately 3 h to estimate the uptake of (18)F radioactivity with respect to time for the pharmacokinetic analysis. Rate constants were calculated by use of a 3-compartment model.

Results: The accumulation of (18)F-FBPA-Fr in brain tumors and the tumor-to-contralateral brain ratio were significantly elevated after intravenous injection of (18)F-FBPA-Fr with BBB-D. (18)F-FBPA-Fr administration after sonication showed that the tumor-to-contralateral brain ratio for the sonicated tumors (3.5) was approximately 1.75-fold higher than that for the control tumors (2.0). Furthermore, the K1/k2 pharmacokinetic ratio after intravenous injection of (18)F-FBPA-Fr with BBB-D was significantly higher than that after intravenous injection without BBB-D.

Conclusion: This study demonstrated that radioactivity in tumors and the tumor-to-normal brain ratio after intravenous injection of (18)F-FBPA-Fr with sonication were significantly higher than those in tumors without sonication. The K1/k2 ratio may be useful for indicating the degree of BBB-D induced by FUS. Further studies are needed to determine whether FUS may be useful for enhancing the delivery of boronophenylalanine in patients with high-grade gliomas.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24525207/
Vision transformer to differentiate between benign and malignant slices in 18F-FDG PET/CT,"Daiki Nishigaki, Yuki Suzuki, Tadashi Watabe, Daisuke Katayama, Hiroki Kato, Tomohiro Wataya, Kosuke Kita, Junya Sato, Noriyuki Tomiyama, Shoji Kido","Fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) is widely used for the detection, diagnosis, and clinical decision-making in oncological diseases. However, in daily medical practice, it is often difficult to make clinical decisions because of physiological FDG uptake or cancers with poor FDG uptake. False negative clinical diagnoses of malignant lesions are critical issues that require attention. In this study, Vision Transformer (ViT) was used to automatically classify18F-FDG PET/CT slices as benign or malignant. This retrospective study included18F-FDG PET/CT data of 207 (143 malignant and 64 benign) patients from a medical institute to train and test our models. The ViT model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.90 [95% CI 0.89, 0.91], which was superior to the baseline Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models (EfficientNet, 0.87 [95% CI 0.86, 0.88], P < 0.001; DenseNet, 0.87 [95% CI 0.86, 0.88], P < 0.001). Even when FDG uptake was low, ViT produced an AUC of 0.81 [95% CI 0.77, 0.85], which was higher than that of the CNN (DenseNet, 0.65 [95% CI 0.59, 0.70], P < 0.001).

(64)Cu-labeled tetrameric and octameric RGD peptides for small-animal PET of tumor alpha(v)beta(3) integrin expression,"Zi-Bo Li, Weibo Cai, Qizhen Cao, Kai Chen, Zhanhong Wu, Lina He, Xiaoyuan Chen","Integrin alpha(v)beta(3) plays a critical role in tumor angiogenesis and metastasis. Suitably radiolabeled cyclic arginine-glycine-aspartic (RGD) peptides can be used for noninvasive imaging of alpha(v)beta(3) expression and targeted radionuclide therapy. In this study, we developed (64)Cu-labeled multimeric RGD peptides, E{E[c(RGDyK)](2)}(2) (RGD tetramer) and E(E{E[c(RGDyK)](2)}(2))(2) (RGD octamer), for PET imaging of tumor integrin alpha(v)beta(3) expression.

Methods: Both RGD tetramer and RGD octamer were synthesized with glutamate as the linker. After conjugation with 1,4,7,10-tetra-azacyclododecane-N,N',N'',N'''-tetraacetic acid (DOTA), the peptides were labeled with (64)Cu for biodistribution and small-animal PET imaging studies (U87MG human glioblastoma xenograft model and c-neu oncomouse model). A cell adhesion assay, a cell-binding assay, receptor blocking experiments, and immunohistochemistry were also performed to evaluate the alpha(v)beta(3)-binding affinity/specificity of the RGD peptide-based conjugates in vitro and in vivo.

Results: RGD octamer had significantly higher integrin alpha(v)beta(3)-binding affinity and specificity than RGD tetramer analog (inhibitory concentration of 50% was 10 nM for octamer vs. 35 nM for tetramer). (64)Cu-DOTA-RGD octamer had higher tumor uptake and longer tumor retention than (64)Cu-DOTA-RGD tetramer in both tumor models tested. The integrin alpha(v)beta(3) specificity of both tracers was confirmed by successful receptor-blocking experiments. The high uptake and slow clearance of (64)Cu-DOTA-RGD octamer in the kidneys was attributed mainly to the integrin positivity of the kidneys, significantly higher integrin alpha(v)beta(3)-binding affinity, and the larger molecular size of the octamer, as compared with the other RGD analogs.

Conclusion: Polyvalency has a profound effect on the receptor-binding affinity and in vivo kinetics of radiolabeled RGD multimers. The information obtained here may guide the future development of RGD peptide-based imaging and internal radiotherapeutic agents targeting integrin alpha(v)beta(3).",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17574975/
Binding of the synaptic vesicle radiotracer [11C]UCB-J is unchanged during functional brain activation using a visual stimulation task,"Kelly Smart, Heather Liu, David Matuskey, Ming-Kai Chen, Kristen Torres, Nabeel Nabulsi, David Labaree, Jim Ropchan, Ansel T Hillmer, Yiyun Huang, Richard E Carson","The positron emission tomography radioligand [11C]UCB-J binds to synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2 A (SV2A), a regulator of vesicle release. Increased neuronal firing could potentially affect tracer concentrations if binding site availability is altered during vesicle exocytosis. This study assessed whether physiological brain activation induces changes in [11C]UCB-J tissue influx (K1), volume of distribution (VT), or binding potential (BPND). Healthy volunteers (n= 7) underwent 60-min [11C]UCB-J PET scans at baseline and during intermittent presentation of 8-Hz checkerboard visual stimulation. Sensitivity to intermittent changes in kinetic parameters was assessed in simulations, and visual stimulation was repeated using functional magnetic resonance imaging to characterize neural responses.VTandK1were determined using the one-tissue compartment model andBPNDusing the simplified reference tissue model. In primary visual cortex,K1increased 34.3 ± 15.5% (p= 0.001) during stimulation, with no change in other regions (ps>0.12).K1change was correlated with fMRI BOLD response (r = 0.77,p= 0.043). There was no change inVT(-3.9 ± 8.8%,p=0.33) orBPND(-0.2 ± 9.6%,p=0.94) in visual cortex nor other regions (ps>0.19).

ImmunoSPECT and immunoPET of IGF-1R expression with the radiolabeled antibody R1507 in a triple-negative breast cancer model,"Sandra Heskamp, Hanneke W M van Laarhoven, Janneke D M Molkenboer-Kuenen, Gerben M Franssen, Yvonne M H Versleijen-Jonkers, Wim J G Oyen, Winette T A van der Graaf, Otto C Boerman","The insulinlike growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) is a new target for the treatment of breast cancer. Patients with breast cancer lesions that express IGF-1R may benefit from treatment with anti-IGF-1R antibodies. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to develop a noninvasive, in vivo imaging method, using radiolabeled antibodies, to visualize IGF-1R expression.

Methods: R1507 is a monoclonal antibody directed against the IGF-1R. In vitro, the affinity and internalization kinetics of (111)In-R1507 were determined using the IGF-1R-expressing triple-negative breast cancer cell line SUM149. In vivo, the pharmacodynamics of (111)In-R1507 and (125)I-R1507 were determined in mice with subcutaneous SUM149 tumors. (111)In-R1507 SPECT and (89)Zr-R1507 PET images of mice with subcutaneous SUM149 tumors were acquired at 1, 3, and 7 d after injection.

Results: (111)In-R1507 (concentration required to inhibit binding by 50%, 0.1 nM) was slowly internalized by SUM149 cells. (111)In-R1507 specifically and efficiently accumulated in the SUM149 xenografts: the tumor uptake was 20 percentage injected dose per gram (%ID/g), 33 %ID/g, and 31 %ID/g at 1, 3, and 7 d after injection, respectively. (125)I-R1507 accumulated in the tumor less efficiently. Small-animal SPECT and small-animal PET of mice clearly visualized the subcutaneous SUM149 xenograft, with increasing contrast at later time points.

Conclusion: (111)In-R1507 and (89)Zr-R1507 are new tracers to noninvasively determine IGF-1R expression in vivo in breast cancer xenografts using SPECT and PET. In the future, these techniques may enable patient selection for IGF-1R-targeted therapy.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20847162/

The anti-seizure drug levetiracetam (LEV) is currently being evaluated in clinical trials for ability to reduce epileptiform activity and improve cognitive function in AD. The purpose of our studies was to establish a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationship with LEV in an amyloidogenic mouse model of AD to enable predictive preclinical to clinical translation, using the rigorous preclinical testing pipeline of the Model Organism Development and Evaluation for Late-Onset Alzheimer's Disease Preclinical Testing Core.

Methods: A multi-tier approach was applied that included quality assurance and quality control of the active pharmaceutical ingredient, PK/PD modeling, positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI), functional outcomes, and transcriptomics. 5XFAD mice were treated chronically with LEV for 3 months at doses in line with those allometrically scaled to the clinical dose range.

Results: Pharmacokinetics of LEV demonstrated sex differences in Cmax, AUC0-∞, and CL/F, and a dose dependence in AUC0-∞. After chronic dosing at 10, 30, 56 mg/kg, PET/MRI tracer18F-AV45, and18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) showed specific regional differences with treatment. LEV did not significantly improve cognitive outcomes. Transcriptomics performed by nanoString demonstrated drug- and dose-related changes in gene expression relevant to human brain regions and pathways congruent with changes in18F-FDG uptake.

Discussion: This study represents the first report of PK/PD assessment of LEV in 5XFAD mice. Overall, these results highlighted non-linear kinetics based on dose and sex. Plasma concentrations of the 10 mg/kg dose in 5XFAD overlapped with human plasma concentrations used for studies of mild cognitive impairment, while the 30 and 56 mg/kg doses were reflective of doses used to treat seizure activity. Post-treatment gene expression analysis demonstrated LEV dose-related changes in immune function and neuronal-signaling pathways relevant to human AD, and aligned with regional18F-FDG uptake. Overall, this study highlights the importance of PK/PD relationships in preclinical studies to inform clinical study design.

Highlights: Significant sex differences in pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam were observed in 5XFAD mice.Plasma concentrations of 10 mg/kg levetiracetam dose in 5XFAD overlapped with human plasma concentration used in the clinic.Drug- and dose-related differences in gene expression relevant to human brain regions and pathways were also similar to brain region-specific changes in 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36016830/
"Alterations in regional ventilation, perfusion, and shunt after smoke inhalation measured by PET","Donna Beth Willey-Courand, R Scott Harris, Gaetano G Galletti, C A Hales, Alan Fischman, Jose G Venegas","Regional changes in ventilation and perfusion occurring in the early hours after smoke inhalation injury were evaluated through the use of positron emission tomography. Five lambs were imaged before and 1, 2, and 4 h after receiving 100 breaths of cotton smoke. Utilizing a recently developed model of (13)N tracer kinetics (3), we evaluated changes in ventilation, perfusion, shunt, and regional gas content in nondependent, middle, and dependent lung zones. The data demonstrated a progressive development of regional shunt in dependent (dorsal) regions in which perfusion remained the highest throughout the study. These findings, together with decreasing regional ventilation and fractional gas content in the dependent regions, correlated with decreasing arterial Pa(O(2)) values over the course of the study. A negative correlation between regional shunt fraction and regional gas content in dependent and middle regions suggests that shunt was caused by progressive alveolar derecruitment or flooding.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12183509/
Validation of [125I]CPCR4.3 as an investigative tool for the sensitive and specific detection of hCXCR4 and mCXCR4 expression in vitro and in vivo,"Margret Schottelius, Marina Ludescher, Frauke Richter, Tobias G Kapp, Horst Kessler, Hans-Jürgen Wester","Background: The development and clinical translation of [68Ga] Pentixafor has substantially promoted the relevance of non-invasive PET imaging of CXCR4 expression in a broad spectrum of diseases, including cancer and inflammation. Its pronounced selectivity for the human receptor (hCXCR4), however, precludes the use of [68Ga] Pentixafor for imaging receptor expression and dynamics in CXCR4-related diseases in endogenous mouse models. To overcome this restriction, [125I]CPCR4.3, a structurally related pentapeptide ligand, has been evaluated as a preclinical tool for efficient in vitro and in vivo targeting of hCXCR4 and mCXCR4.

Results: Compared to the reference [68Ga] Pentixafor, [125I]CPCR4.3 showed 2.4- to 11-fold increased specific binding to human cancer cell lines with different hCXCR4 expression levels (Jurkat, Daudi, HT-29, SH-5YSY, MCF-7, LNCaP) as well as strong and highly specific binding to mCXCR4 expressing cells (mCXCR4-transfected CHO cells, Eμ-myc 1080, 4 T1), which was not detectable for [68Ga]Pentixafor. This is the consequence of the equally high affinity of iodo-CPCR4 to hCXCR4 and mCXCR4 (IC50= 5.4 ± 1.5 and 4.9 ± 1.7 nM, respectively) as opposed to [natGa] Pentixafor (hCXCR4: 42.4 ± 11.6 nM, mCXCR4: > 1000 nM). Additionally, [125I]CPCR4.3 showed enhanced tracer internalization (factor of 1.5-2 compared to the reference). In vivo biodistribution studies in immunocompetent Black Six and immunocompromised CD-1 nude mice showed predominant hepatobiliary excretion of [125I]CPCR4.3 (logP = 0.51), leading to high activity levels in liver and intestines. However, [125I]CPCR4.3 also showed high and specific accumulation in organs with endogenous mCXCR4 expression (spleen, lung, adrenals), even at low receptor expression levels.

Conclusions: Due to its excellent hCXCR4 and mCXCR4 targeting efficiency, both in vitro and in vivo, [125I]CPCR4.3 represents a sensitive and reliable tool for the species-independent quantification of CXCR4 expression. Its suboptimal clearance properties will certainly restrict its use for in vivo imaging applications using123I (for SPECT) or124I (for PET), but due to its high and specific accumulation in mCXCR4 expressing tissues, [125I]CPCR4.3 holds promise as a powerful preclinical tool for the investigation and quantification of CXCR4 involvement and kinetics in various murine disease models via, e.g., biodistribution and autoradiography studies.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31410585/
"Alanine and glycine conjugates of (2S,4R)-4-[18F]fluoroglutamine for tumor imaging","Zhihao Zha, Karl Ploessl, Brian P Lieberman, Limin Wang, Hank F Kung","Introduction: Glutamine is an essential source of energy, metabolic substrates, and building block for supporting tumor proliferation. Previously, (2S,4R)-4-[18F]fluoroglutamine (4F-Gln) was reported as a glutamine-related metabolic imaging agent. To improve the in vivo kinetics of this radiotracer, two new dipeptides, [18F]Gly-(2S,4R)4-fluoroglutamine (Gly-4F-Gln) and [18F]Ala-(2S,4R)4-fluoroglutamine (Ala-4F-Gln) were investigated.

Methods: Radiolabeling was performed via 2-steps18F-fluorination. Cell uptake studies of Gly-4F-Gln and Ala-4F-Gln were investigated in 9 L cell lines. In vitro and in vivo metabolism studies were carried out in Fisher 344 rats. Biodistribution and microPET imaging studies were performed in 9 L tumor-bearing rats.

Results: In vitro incubation of these [18F]dipeptides in rat and human blood showed a rapid conversion to (2S,4R)-4-[18F]fluoroglutamine (t1/2= 2.3 and 0.2 min for [18F]Gly-4F-Gln and [18F]Ala-4F-Gln, respectively for human blood). Biodistribution and PET imaging in Fisher 344 rats bearing 9 L tumor xenografts showed that these dipeptides rapidly localized in the tumors, comparable to that of (2S,4R)-4-[18F]fluoroglutamine (4F-Gln).

Conclusions: The results support that these dipeptides, [18F]Gly-4F-Gln and [18F]Ala-4F-Gln, are prodrugs, which hydrolyze in the blood after an iv injection. They appear to be selectively taken up and trapped by tumor tissue in vivo. The dipeptide, [18F]Ala-4F-Gln, may be suitable as a PET tracer for imaging glutaminolysis in tumors.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29525446/

In the present study, we have further evaluated the imaging and metabolic properties of [18F]FC0324 in a rat model of human CB2R overexpression in the brain (AAV-hCB2) and in non-human primates (NHPs). Autoradiography with AAV-hCB2rat brain sections exhibited a signal of [18F]FC0324 8-fold higher in the ipsilateral region than in the contralateral region. Blocking with NE40, a CB2R-specific agonist, resulted in a 91% decrease in the radioactivity. PET experiments showed a signal 7-fold higher in the ipsilateral region, and the specificity of [18F]FC0324 forhCB2R in vivo was confirmed by the 80% decrease after blocking with NE40. In NHPs, brain time-activity curves displayed a fast and homogeneous distribution followed by a rapid washout, in accordance with the low amount of CB2Rs in healthy brain. Whole-body PET-CT suggested a high and specific uptake of the radiotracer in the spleen, a CB2R-rich organ, and in the organs involved in metabolism and excretion, with a low bone uptake. In vitro metabolism with monkey liver microsomes (MLMs) led to the formation of six main hydroxylated metabolites of FC0324. Five of them were produced by human liver microsomes, being much less active than MLMs. In vivo, in NHPs, the main radiometabolite was likely to result from further oxidation of hydroxylated compounds, and parent [18F]FC0324 accounted for 8 ± 3% of plasma radioactivity (at 120 min p.i.) with a low level of potential interfering radiometabolites. Furthermore, this metabolism should be significantly reduced in humans due to species differences. In conclusion, [18F]FC0324 appears to be a promising candidate for further human studies with suitable kinetics, selectivity, and metabolic profile for CB2R PET imaging.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39421654/
MicroPET imaging of brain tumor angiogenesis with 18F-labeled PEGylated RGD peptide,"Xiaoyuan Chen, Ryan Park, Yingping Hou, Vazgen Khankaldyyan, Ignacio Gonzales-Gomez, Michel Tohme, James R Bading, Walter E Laug, Peter S Conti","We have previously labeled cyclic RGD peptide c(RGDyK) with fluorine-18 through conjugation labeling via a prosthetic 4-[18F]fluorobenzoyl moiety and applied this [18F]FB-RGD radiotracer for alphav-integrin expression imaging in different preclinical tumor models with good tumor-to-background contrast. However, the unfavorable hepatobiliary excretion and rapid tumor washout rate of this tracer limit its potential clinical applications. The aims of this study were to modify the [18F]FB-RGD tracer by inserting a heterobifunctional poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG, M.W. =3,400) between the 18F radiolabel and the RGD moiety and to test this [18F]FB-PEG-RGD tracer for brain tumor targeting and in vivo kinetics. [18F]FB-PEG-RGD was prepared by coupling the RGD-PEG conjugate with N-succinimidyl 4-[18F]fluorobenzoate ([18F]SFB) under slightly basic conditions (pH=8.5). The radiochemical yield was about 20-30% based on the active ester [18F]SFB, and specific activity was over 100 GBq/micromol. This tracer had fast blood clearance, rapid and high tumor uptake in the subcutaneous U87MG glioblastoma model (5.2+/-0.5%ID/g at 30 min p.i.). Moderately rapid tumor washout was observed, with the activity accumulation decreased to 2.2+/-0.4%ID/g at 4 h p.i. MicroPET and autoradiography imaging showed a very high tumor-to-background ratio and limited activity accumulation in the liver, kidneys and intestinal tracts. U87MG tumor implanted into the mouse forebrain was well visualized with [18F]FB-PEG-RGD. Although uptake in the orthotopic tumor was significantly lower (P<0.01) than in the subcutaneous tumor, the maximum tumor-to-brain ratio still reached 5.0+/-0.6 due to low normal brain background. The results of H&E staining post mortem agreed with the anatomical information obtained from non-invasive microPET imaging. In conclusion, PEGylation suitably modifies the physiological behavior of the RGD peptide. [18F]FB-PEG-RGD gave improved tumor retention and in vivo kinetics compared with [18F]FB-RGD.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15118844/
Fibroblast Activation Protein Inhibitor Theranostics: Preclinical Considerations,"Kazuko Kaneda-Nakashima, Yoshifumi Shirakami, Yuichiro Kadonaga, Tadashi Watabe","Fibroblast activation protein (FAP) was first reported in 1986. However, FAP is not expressed in normal fibroblasts, normal or malignant epithelial cells, or the stroma of benign epithelial tumors. FAP is a cell membrane-bound serine peptidase overexpressed on the surface of cancer-associated fibroblasts and, as such, is a novel target for molecular imaging of several tumors. FAP inhibitors (FAPI) are potential theranostic molecular probes for various cancers. A tumor model expressing FAP was used to verify or confirm the usefulness of FAPI experimentally.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36997365/
AmyloidPETNet: Classification of Amyloid Positivity in Brain PET Imaging Using End-to-End Deep Learning,"Shuyang Fan, Maria Rosana Ponisio, Pan Xiao, Sung Min Ha, Satrajit Chakrabarty, John J Lee, Shaney Flores, Pamela LaMontagne, Brian Gordon, Cyrus A Raji, Daniel S Marcus, Arash Nazeri, Beau M Ances, Randall J Bateman, John C Morris, Tammie L S Benzinger, Aristeidis Sotiras, Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative","Background Visual assessment of amyloid PET scans relies on the availability of radiologist expertise, whereas quantification of amyloid burden typically involves MRI for processing and analysis, which can be computationally expensive. Purpose To develop a deep learning model to classify minimally processed brain PET scans as amyloid positive or negative, evaluate its performance on independent data sets and different tracers, and compare it with human visual reads. Materials and Methods This retrospective study used 8476 PET scans (6722 patients) obtained from late 2004 to early 2023 that were analyzed across five different data sets. A deep learning model, AmyloidPETNet, was trained on 1538 scans from 766 patients, validated on 205 scans from 95 patients, and internally tested on 184 scans from 95 patients in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) fluorine 18 (18F) florbetapir (FBP) data set. It was tested on ADNI scans using different tracers and scans from independent data sets. Scan amyloid positivity was based on mean cortical standardized uptake value ratio cutoffs. To compare with model performance, each scan from both the Centiloid Project and a subset of the Anti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic Alzheimer's Disease (A4) study were visually interpreted with a confidence level (low, intermediate, high) of amyloid positivity/negativity. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and other performance metrics were calculated, and Cohen κ was used to measure physician-model agreement. Results The model achieved an AUC of 0.97 (95% CI: 0.95, 0.99) on test ADNI18F-FBP scans, which generalized well to18F-FBP scans from the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (AUC, 0.95; 95% CI: 0.93, 0.97) and the A4 study (AUC, 0.98; 95% CI: 0.98, 0.98). Model performance was high when applied to data sets with different tracers (AUC ≥ 0.97). Other performance metrics provided converging evidence. Physician-model agreement ranged from fair (Cohen κ = 0.39; 95% CI: 0.16, 0.60) on a sample of mostly equivocal cases from the A4 study to almost perfect (Cohen κ = 0.93; 95% CI: 0.86, 1.0) on the Centiloid Project. Conclusion The developed model was capable of automatically and accurately classifying brain PET scans as amyloid positive or negative without relying on experienced readers or requiring structural MRI.

FDG uptake tracks the oxidative damage in diabetic skeletal muscle: An experimental study,"Matteo Bauckneht, Vanessa Cossu, Patrizia Castellani, Patrizia Piccioli, Anna Maria Orengo, Laura Emionite, Francesco Di Giulio, Maria Isabella Donegani, Alberto Miceli, Stefano Raffa, Anna Borra, Selene Capitanio, Silvia Morbelli, Giacomo Caviglia, Silvia Bruno, Silvia Ravera, Davide Maggi, Gianmario Sambuceti, Cecilia Marini","Objectives: The present study aims to verify the relationship between glucose consumption and uptake of18F-2-deoxy-glucose (FDG) in the skeletal muscle (SM) of experimental models of streptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus (STZ-DM).

Methods: The study included 36 Balb/c mice. Two weeks after intraperitoneal administration of saline (control group, n = 18) or 150 mg streptozotocin (STZ-DM group, n = 18), the two cohorts were submitted to an oral glucose tolerance test and were further subdivided into three groups (n = 6 each): untreated and treated with metformin (MTF) at low or high doses (10 or 750 mg/kg daily, respectively). Two weeks thereafter, all mice were submitted to dynamic micro-positron emission tomography (PET) imaging after prolonged fasting. After sacrifice, enzymatic pathways and response to oxidative stress were evaluated in harvested SM.

Results: On PET imaging, the FDG uptake rate in hindlimb SM was significantly lower in nondiabetic mice as compared with STZ-DM-untreated mice. MTF had no significant effect on SM FDG uptake in untreated mice; however, its high dose induced a significant decrease in STZ-DM animals. Upon conventional analysis, the SM standard uptake value was higher in STZ-DM mice, while MTF was virtually ineffective in either control or STZ-DM models. This metabolic reprogramming was not explained by any change in cytosolic glucose metabolism. By contrast, it closely agreed with the catalytic function of hexose-6P-dehydrogenase (H6PD; i.e., the trigger of a specific pentose phosphate pathway selectively located within the endoplasmic reticulum). In agreement with this role, the H6PD enzymatic response to both STZ-DM and MTF matched the activation of the NADPH-dependent antioxidant responses to the increased generation of reactive oxygen species caused by chronic hyperglycemia. Ex vivo analysis of tracer kinetics confirmed that the enhanced SM avidity for FDG occurred despite a significant reduction in glucose consumption, while it was associated with increased radioactivity transfer to the endoplasmic reticulum.

Conclusions: These data challenge the current dogma linking FDG uptake to the glycolytic rate. They instead introduce a new model considering a strict link between the uptake of this glucose analog, H6PD reticular activity, and oxidative damage in diabetes, at least under fasting condition.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31918925/
Effect of starvation on brain glucose metabolism and 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose uptake: an experimental in-vivo and ex-vivo study,"Ambra Buschiazzo, Vanessa Cossu, Matteo Bauckneht, Annamaria Orengo, Patrizia Piccioli, Laura Emionite, Giovanna Bianchi, Federica Grillo, Anna Rocchi, Francesco Di Giulio, Francesco Fiz, Lizzia Raffaghello, Flavio Nobili, Silvia Bruno, Giacomo Caviglia, Silvia Ravera, Fabio Benfenati, Michele Piana, Silvia Morbelli, Gianmario Sambuceti, Cecilia Marini","Background: The close connection between neuronal activity and glucose consumption accounts for the clinical value of 18F-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG) imaging in neurodegenerative disorders. Nevertheless, brain metabolic response to starvation (STS) might hamper the diagnostic accuracy of FDG PET/CT when the cognitive impairment results in a severe food deprivation.

Methods: Thirty six-week-old BALB/c female mice were divided into two groups: ""control"" group (n = 15) were kept under standard conditions and exposed to fasting for 6 h before the study; the remaining ""STS"" mice were submitted to 48 h STS (absence of food and free access to water) before imaging. In each group, nine mice were submitted to dynamic micro-PET imaging to estimate brain and skeletal muscle glucose consumption (C- and SM-MRGlu*) by Patlak approach, while six mice were sacrificed for ex vivo determination of the lumped constant, defined as the ratio between CMRGlu* and glucose consumption measured by glucose removal from the incubation medium (n = 3) or biochemical analyses (n = 3), respectively.

Results: CMRGlu* was lower in starved than in control mice (46.1 ± 23.3 vs 119.5 ± 40.2 nmol × min-1× g-1, respectively, p < 0.001). Ex vivo evaluation documented a remarkable stability of lumped constant as documented by the stability of GLUT expression, G6Pase activity, and kinetic features of hexokinase-catalyzed phosphorylation. However, brain SUV in STS mice was even (though not significantly) higher with respect to control mice. Conversely, a marked decrease in both SM-MRGlu* and SM-SUV was documented in STS mice with respect to controls.

Conclusions: STS markedly decreases brain glucose consumption without altering measured FDG SUV in mouse experimental models. This apparent paradox does not reflect any change in lumped constant. Rather, it might be explained by the metabolic response of the whole body: the decrease in FDG sequestration by the skeletal muscle is as profound as to prolong tracer persistence in the bloodstream and thus its availability for brain uptake.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29892963/
(68)Ga-labeled cyclic RGD dimers with Gly3 and PEG4 linkers: promising agents for tumor integrin alphavbeta3 PET imaging,"Zhaofei Liu, Gang Niu, Jiyun Shi, Shuanglong Liu, Fan Wang, Shuang Liu, Xiaoyuan Chen","Purpose: Radiolabeled cyclic RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp) peptides have great potential for the early tumor detection and noninvasive monitoring of tumor metastasis and therapeutic response. (18)F-labeled RGD analogs ([(18)F]-AH111585 and [(18)F]Galacto-RGD) have been investigated in clinical trials for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of integrin expression in cancer patients. To develop new RGD radiotracers with higher tumor accumulation, improved in vivo kinetics, easy availability and low cost, we developed two new RGD peptides and labeled them with generator-eluted (68)Ga (t(1/2) = 68 min) for PET imaging of integrin alpha(v)beta(3) expression in tumor xenograft models.

Materials and methods: The two new cyclic RGD dimers, E[PEG(4)-c(RGDfK)](2) (P(4)-RGD2, PEG(4) = 15-amino-4,7,10,13-tetraoxapentadecanoic acid) and E[Gly(3)-c(RGDfK)](2) (G(3)-RGD2, G(3) = Gly-Gly-Gly) were designed, synthesized and conjugated with 1,4,7-triazacyclononanetriacetic acid (NOTA) for (68)Ga labeling. The microPET imaging and biodistribution of the (68)Ga labeled RGD tracers were investigated in integrin alpha(v)beta(3)-positive tumor xenografts.

Results: The new RGD dimers with the Gly(3) and PEG(4) linkers showed higher integrin alpha(v)beta(3) binding affinity than no-linker RGD dimer (RGD2). NOTA-G(3)-RGD2 and NOTA-P(4)-RGD2 could be labeled with (68)Ga within 30 min with higher purity (>98%) and specific activity (8.88-11.84 MBq/nmol). Both (68)Ga-NOTA-P(4)-RGD2 and (68)Ga-NOTA-G(3)-RGD2 exhibited significantly higher tumor uptake and tumor-to-normal tissue ratios than (68)Ga-NOTA-RGD2.

Conclusion: Because of their high affinity, high specificity and excellent pharmacokinetic properties, further investigation of the two novel RGD dimers for clinical PET imaging of integrin alpha(v)beta(3) expression in cancer patients is warranted.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19159928/
Comparison of maximal myocardial blood flow during adenosine infusion with that of intravenous dipyridamole in normal men,"S Y Chan, R C Brunken, J Czernin, G Porenta, W Kuhle, J Krivokapich, M E Phelps, H R Schelbert","Objective: This study compared quantitatively the efficacy of intravenous adenosine and dipyridamole for pharmacologic induction of myocardial hyperemia.

Background: Pharmacologic vasodilation is used increasingly for induction of myocardial hyperemia in conjunction with radionuclide imaging of myocardial blood flow. Although both intravenous dipyridamole and adenosine have been used, the magnitude of hyperemia induced by these agents and the hyperemia to baseline blood flow ratios have not been quantified and compared.

Methods: Twenty normal volunteers were studied with dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) and intravenous nitrogen-13 ammonia. Myocardial blood flow was quantified with a two-compartment tracer kinetic model.

Results: Myocardial blood flow at rest averaged 1.1 +/- 0.2 ml/min per g and increased significantly to 4.4 +/- 0.9 ml/min per g during adenosine and 4.3 +/- 1.3 ml/min per g after dipyridamole administration. Hyperemia to baseline flow ratios averaged 4.3 +/- 1.6 for adenosine and 4.0 +/- 1.3 for dipyridamole. The average flow ratios and the maximal flows achieved were similar for both agents, but there was considerable variation in the individual response to these agents, as indicated by the range of hyperemia to baseline flow ratios (from 2.0 to 8.4 for adenosine and from 1.5 to 5.8 for dipyridamole). In addition, the hyperemic responses to dipyridamole and to adenosine differed by greater than 1 ml/min per g in nine subjects.

Conclusions: Despite these inter- and intraindividual differences, we conclude that both agents are equally effective in producing myocardial hyperemia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1527310/
Kinetics of vascular targeted monoclonal antibody,"Stephen J Kennel, Ying Huang, Wen-Bin Zeng, Alan Stuckey, Jonathan Wall","Purpose: There is growing interest in delivery of drugs and radioisotopes with carriers designed to target molecular receptors in the vascular space. In contrast to targets outside of blood vessels, vascular receptors are easily accessed and tracer binding is not significantly impacted by the size of the targeted drug carrier. Although it is accepted that vascular targeting is very efficient, the kinetics of target binding in the vascular space immediately after injection has not been evaluated. MAb 201B accumulation in mouse lung, by virtue of its binding to thrombomodulin on lung endothelium, has been used as a model for imaging and vascular targeting.

Procedures: MAb 201B was radioiodinated with either (125)I comparing two different methods of radioiodination to assess label stability. MAb accumulation and retention were monitored after iv injection in normal BALB/c mice by standard biodistribution experiments, SPECT/CT. MAb radiolabeled with positron emitting (124)I was evaluated by dynamic microPET.

Results: The data show that lung uptake and kinetics of loss (t1/2≈40 hrs) of (125)I MAb 201B was similar with two different radio-iodination methods. Loss of radioiodine was detected in sample radiolabeled using the chloramines T method, but only at later time points(24hrs). For very short time evaluations the more efficient chloramine T method was adopted for PET studies with (124)I. Lung uptake of (124)I MAb 201B occurred within seconds of injection as observed in dynamic microPET analysis with little (124)I MAb ever detected in the peripheral circulation. In contrast, distribution kinetics of control (124)I MAb 14 or (124)I MAb 201B that had been diluted with excess cold MAb demonstrated equilibration throughout the vascular space.

Conclusion: Accumulation of MAb targeted to epitopes in the vascular space occurs very rapidly, is highly specific and very efficient. Drug delivery with vascular targeting agents can accommodate fast acting therapeutic agents including short half lived radioisotopes.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20950267/
Preclinical evaluation of 64Cu-labeled cetuximab in immuno-PET for detecting sentinel lymph node metastasis in epidermal growth factor receptor-positive breast cancer,"Takeshi Usui, Tomohiro Miyake, Tadashi Watabe, Hiroki Kato, Yukie Yoshii, Sadahiro Naka, Kaori Abe, Misato Masuyama, Nanae Masunaga, Tetsuhiro Yoshinami, Masami Tsukabe, Yoshiaki Sota, Tomonori Tanei, Masafumi Shimoda, Kenzo Shimazu","Background: Despite advances in breast cancer imaging, reliable detection of sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastasis remains challenging. This study aimed to determine the ability of immuno-positron emission tomography (PET) using64Cu-labeled cetuximab to detect SLN metastasis in a model of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-positive breast cancer.

Methods: The SLN metastasis model was established using the EGFR-strongly-expressing MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cell line. In this xenograft model, [64Cu]Cu-PCTA-cetuximab was administered intravenously (5.8 ± 0.9 MBq; n = 12) or both intradermally and subdermally into the parapapillary region of the tumor-containing mammary gland (4.3 ± 0.4 MBq; n = 11), after which PET was performed.18F-FDG PET was also performed intravenously (9.1 ± 1.4 MBq; n = 4) or intradermally/subdermally (5.4 ± 2.2 MBq; n = 3) in the same cohort before [64Cu]Cu-PCTA-cetuximab PET. PET/computed tomography was performed 60 min after administration of18F-FDG and 24 h after administration of [64Cu]Cu-PCTA-cetuximab. Delayed PET/CT scans were conducted 48 h after administration for all mice in the intradermally/subdermally administered [64Cu]Cu-PCTA-cetuximab group and for four of the 12 mice in the intravenously administered [64Cu]Cu-PCTA-cetuximab group. SLNs were identified using blue dye, and PET and pathological evaluations of the resected SLN were performed to confirm metastases.

Results: After intravenous administration of [64Cu]Cu-PCTA-cetuximab (n = 12), accumulation was detected in the primary tumor in all mice and in the axilla of eight mice (67%, SUVmax1.24 ± 0.51), all of which were found to have SLNs with histologically confirmed metastasis. The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and negative and positive predictive values for PET with intravenously administered [64Cu]Cu-PCTA-cetuximab were 89%, 100%, 92%, 75%, and 100%, respectively. In contrast, all mice with intradermal/subdermal administration (n = 11) showed high accumulation in both the primary tumor and axillary lymph nodes (SUVmax4.28 ± 1.19), with six mice (55%, SUVmax5.01 ± 1.12) having histologically confirmed metastasis. The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and positive predictive values for PET with intradermally/subdermally administered [64Cu]Cu-PCTA-cetuximab were 100%, 0%, 55% and 55%, respectively. SLN metastasis was not detectable by intravenous or intradermal/subdermal18F-FDG PET.

Conclusions: PET with intravenously administered [64Cu]Cu-PCTA-cetuximab demonstrated high precision for diagnosis of SLN metastasis in a xenograft model of EGFR-positive human breast cancer. Although further evaluation is necessary, intradermal/subdermal administration could be a useful therapeutic approach owing to its high accumulation in SLNs.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40055744/
In vivo evaluation of PEGylated ⁶⁴Cu-liposomes with theranostic and radiotherapeutic potential using micro PET/CT,"Anncatrine Luisa Petersen, Jonas Rosager Henriksen, Tina Binderup, Dennis Ringkjøbing Elema, Palle Hedengran Rasmussen, Anne Mette Hag, Andreas Kjær, Thomas Lars Andresen","Purpose: The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential of PEGylated (64)Cu-liposomes in clinical diagnostic positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and PEGylated (177)Lu-liposomes in internal tumor radiotherapy through in vivo characterization and dosimetric analysis in a human xenograft mouse model.

Methods: Liposomes with 5 and 10 mol% PEG were characterized with respect to size, charge, and (64)Cu- and (177)Lu-loading efficiency. The tumor imaging potential of (64)Cu-loaded liposomes was evaluated in terms of in vivo biodistribution, tumor accumulation and tumor-to-muscle (T/M) ratios, using PET imaging. The potential of PEGylated liposomes for diagnostic and therapeutic applications was further evaluated through dosimetry analysis using OLINDA/EXM software. The (64)Cu-liposomes were used as biological surrogates to estimate the organ and tumor kinetics of (177)Lu-liposomes.

Results: High remote loading efficiency (>95 %) was obtained for both (64)Cu and (177)Lu radionuclides with PEGylated liposomes, and essentially no leakage of the encapsulated radionuclide was observed upon storage and after serum incubation for 24 h at 37 °C. The 10 mol% PEG liposomes showed higher tumor accumulation (6.2 ± 0.2 %ID/g) than the 5 mol% PEG liposomes, as evaluated by PET imaging. The dosimetry analysis of the (64)Cu-liposomes estimated an acceptable total effective dose of 3.3·10(-2) mSv/MBq for diagnostic imaging in patients. A high absorbed tumor dose (114 mGy/MBq) was estimated for the potential radiotherapeutic (177)Lu-liposomes.

Conclusion: The overall preclinical profile of PEGylated (64)Cu-liposomes showed high potential as a new PET theranostic tracer for imaging in humans. Dosimetry results predicted that initial administered activity of 200 MBq of (64)Cu-liposomes should be acceptable in patients. Work is in progress to validate the utility of PEGylated (64)Cu-liposomes in a clinical research programme. The high absorbed tumor dose (114 mGy/MBq) estimated for (177)Lu-liposomes and the preliminary dosimetric studies justify further therapeutic and dosimetry investigation of (177)Lu-liposomes in animals before potential testing in man.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26646780/
Uptake of 4-borono-2-[18F]fluoro-L-phenylalanine in sporadic and neurofibromatosis 2-related schwannoma and meningioma studied with PET,"Katja Havu-Aurén, Johanna Kiiski, Kaisa Lehtiö, Olli Eskola, Martti Kulvik, Ville Vuorinen, Vesa Oikonen, Jyrki Vähätalo, Juha Jääskeläinen, Heikki Minn","Purpose: Meningiomas and schwannomas associated with neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) are difficult to control by microsurgery and stereotactic radiotherapy alone. Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) is a chemically targeted form of radiotherapy requiring increased concentration of boron-10 in tumour tissue. PET with the boron carrier 4-borono-2-[(18)F]fluoro-L-phenylalanine ([(18)F]FBPA) allows investigation of whether 4-borono-L-phenylalanine (BPA) concentrates in NF2 tumours, which would make BNCT feasible.

Methods: We studied dynamic uptake of [(18)F]FBPA in intracranial meningiomas (n=4) and schwannomas (n=6) of five sporadic and five NF2 patients. Tracer input function and cerebral blood volume were measured. [(18)F]FBPA uptake in tumour and brain was assessed with a three-compartmental model and graphical analysis. These, together with standardised uptake values (SUVs), were used to define tumour-to-brain [(18)F]FBPA tissue activity gradients.

Results: Model fits with three parameters K (1) (transport), k (2) (reverse transport) and k (3) (intracellular metabolism) were found to best illustrate [(18)F]FBPA uptake kinetics. Maximum SUV was two- to fourfold higher in tumour as compared with normal brain and independent of NF2 status. The increased uptake was due to higher transport of [(18)F]FBPA in tumour. In multiple-time graphical analysis (MTGA, Gjedde-Patlak plot) the tumour-to-brain [(18)F]FBPA influx constant (K (i) -MTGA) ratios varied between 1.8 and 5.4 in NF2-associated tumours while in sporadic tumours the ratio was 1-1.4.

Conclusion: [(18)F]FBPA PET offers a viable means to evaluate BPA uptake in meningiomas and schwannomas in NF2. Based on our results on tumour uptake of [(18)F]FBPA, some of these benign neoplasms may be amenable to BNCT.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16896669/
Serotonin transporter occupancy and the functional neuroanatomic effects of citalopram in geriatric depression,"Gwenn S Smith, Alan Kahn, Julia Sacher, Pablo Rusjan, Thilo van Eimeren, Alastair Flint, Alan A Wilson","Objectives: The functional neuroanatomic changes associated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) treatment have been the focus of positron emission tomography (PET) studies of cerebral glucose metabolism in geriatric depression.

Design: To evaluate the underlying neurochemical mechanisms, both cerebral glucose metabolism and serotonin transporter (SERT) availability were measured before and during treatment with the SSRI, citalopram. It was hypothesized that SERT occupancy would be observed in cortical and limbic brain regions that have shown metabolic effects, as well as striatal and thalamic regions that have been implicated in prior studies in midlife patients.

Setting: Psychiatric outpatient clinic.

Participants: Seven depressed patients who met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition criteria for current major depressive episode were enrolled.

Intervention: Patients underwent a 12-week open-label trial of the SSRI, citalopram.

Measurements: Patients underwent high-resolution research tomography PET scans to measure changes in cerebral glucose metabolism and SERT occupancy by citalopram treatment (after 8-10 weeks of treatment).

Results: Three different tracer kinetic models were applied to the [¹¹C]-DASB region-of-interest data and yielded similar results of an average of greater than 70% SERT occupancy in the striatum and thalamus during citalopram treatment. Voxel-wise analyses showed significant SERT occupancy in these regions, as well as cortical (e.g., anterior cingulate, superior and middle frontal, precuneus, and limbic (parahippocampal gyrus) areas that also showed reductions in glucose metabolism.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that cortical and limbic SERT occupancy may be an underlying mechanism for the regional cerebral metabolic effects of citalopram in geriatric depression.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21841458/
"In vivo Visualization of M2 Macrophages in the Myocardium After Myocardial Infarction (MI) Using 68 Ga-NOTA-Anti-MMR Nb: Targeting Mannose Receptor (MR, CD206) on M2 Macrophages","Zohreh Varasteh, Miriam Braeuer, Sarajo Mohanta, Anna-Lena Steinsiek, Andreas Habenicht, Negar Omidvari, Geoffrey J Topping, Christoph Rischpler, Wolfgang A Weber, Hendrik B Sager, Geert Raes, Sophie Hernot, Markus Schwaiger","Introduction and objectives: Wound healing after myocardial infarction (MI) is a dynamic and complex multiple phase process, and a coordinated cellular response is required for proper scar formation. The current paradigm suggests that pro-inflammatory monocytes infiltrate the MI zone during the initial pro-inflammatory phase and differentiate into inflammatory macrophages, and then switch their phenotypes to anti-inflammatory during the reparative phase. Visualization of the reparative phase post-MI is of great interest because it may reveal delayed resolution of inflammation, which in turn predicts adverse cardiac remodeling. Imaging of anti-inflammatory macrophages may also be used to assess therapy approaches aiming to modulate the inflammatory response in order to limit MI size. Reparative macrophages can be distinguished from inflammatory macrophages by the surface marker mannose receptor (MR, CD206). In this study we evaluated the feasibility of68Ga-NOTA-anti-MMR Nb for imaging of MR on alternatively activated macrophages in murine MI models.

Methods: Wildtype and MR-knockout mice and Wistar rats were subjected to MI via permanent ligation of the left coronary artery. Non-operated or sham-operated animals were used as controls. MR expression kinetics on cardiac macrophages was measured in mice using flow cytometry. PET/CT scans were performed 1 h after intravenous injection of68Ga-NOTA-anti-MMR Nb. Mice and rats were euthanized and hearts harvested forex vivoPET/MRI, autoradiography, and staining. As a non-targeting negative control,68Ga-NOTA-BCII10 was used.

Results: In vivo-PET/CT scans showed focal radioactivity signals in the infarcted myocardium for68Ga-NOTA-anti-MMR Nb which were confirmed byex vivo-PET/MRI scans. In autoradiography images, augmented uptake of the tracer was observed in infarcts, as verified by the histochemistry analysis. Immunofluorescence staining demonstrated the presence and co-localization of CD206- and CD68-positive cells, in accordance to infarct zone. Noin vivoorex vivosignal was observed in the animals injected with control Nb or in the sham-operated animals.68Ga-NOTA-anti-MMR Nb uptake in the infarcts of MR-knockout mice was negligibly low, confirming the specificity of68Ga-NOTA-anti-MMR Nb to MR.

Conclusion: This exploratory study highlights the potential of68Ga-NOTA-anti-MMR Nb to image MR-positive macrophages that are known to play a pivotal role in wound healing that follows acute MI.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35548425/

Here, we examined changes in binding of the sigma-1 agonist (11)C-SA4503 in C6 glioma cells and in living rats after modification of endogenous steroid levels.

Methods: (11)C-SA4503 binding was assessed in C6 monolayers by gamma counting and in anaesthetized rats by microPET scanning. C6 cells were either repeatedly washed and incubated in steroid-free medium or exposed to five kinds of exogenous steroids (1 h or 5 min before tracer addition, respectively). Tumour-bearing male rats were repeatedly treated with pentobarbital (a condition known to result in reduction of endogenous steroid levels) or injected with progesterone.

Results: Binding of (11)C-SA4503 to C6 cells was increased (approximately 50%) upon removal and decreased (approximately 60%) upon addition of steroid hormones (rank order of potency: progesterone > allopregnanolone = testosterone = androstanolone > dehydroepiandrosterone-3-sulphate, IC(50) progesterone 33 nM). Intraperitoneally administered progesterone reduced tumour uptake and tumour-to-muscle contrast (36%). Repeated treatment of animals with pentobarbital increased the PET standardized uptake value of (11)C-SA4503 in tumour (16%) and brain (27%), whereas the kinetics of blood pool radioactivity was unaffected.

Conclusions: The binding of (11)C-SA4503 is sensitive to steroid competition. Since not only increases but also decreases of steroid levels affect ligand binding, a considerable fraction of the sigma-1 receptor population in cultured tumour cells or tumour-bearing animals is normally occupied by endogenous steroids.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19247652/
Measurement of cyclosporin induced changes in P-glycoprotein function at the human blood-brain barrier using [18F]MC225 and PET,"Pascalle Mossel, Giordana Salvi de Souza, Antoon T M Willemsen, Gilles N Stormezand, Nicola A Colabufo, Jun Toyohara, Hendrikus H Boersma, Rudi A J O Dierckx, Adriaan A Lammertsma, Anna L Bartels, Gert Luurtsema","Introduction: P-glycoprotein (P-gp) or multidrug-resistance protein is one of the most extensively studied efflux transporters at the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Changes in P-gp function are associated with several neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia and with the bioavailability of several pharmaceuticals in the brain, causing multi-drug resistance or side effects. PET imaging can be used to measure the P-gp function in vivo. This study aims to validate [18F]MC225 as specific P-gp PET tracer with the use of cyclosporin as selective P-gp inhibitor.

Methods: Fourteen healthy volunteers (age 67 ± 5y) were included. Subjects underwent twice a 60 min dynamic [18F]MC225 (200MBq) PET scan with continuous arterial blood sampling and a cerebral T1-weighted MRI as anatomical reference. During the second scan, in five subjects, cyclosporin was administered in a dose of 2.5 mg/kg/hour, starting 30 min prior to the scan, to inhibit the BBB P-gp function. Tissue time-activity curves of preselected brain regions (Hammer's atlas) were fitted to a reversible two-tissue compartment model (2T4k) using the metabolite corrected plasma and uncorrected whole blood curves as input functions.

Results: No significant difference was found in plasma kinetics, plasma curves, plasma-to-whole blood ratio, and the parent fraction of the baseline scans and scans after administration of cyclosporin. Volume of distribution values in whole brain grey matter showed a significant increase (6.18 ± 1.29 to 9.00 ± 1.29 mL·cm- 3,p = 0.03) after the administration of cyclosporin.

Conclusion: The outcomes of the current study reflect the potential ability of [18F]MC225 to measure cyclosporin induced changes in P-gp function at the human BBB in vivo.

Micro-PET imaging of alphavbeta3-integrin expression with 18F-labeled dimeric RGD peptide,"Xiaoyuan Chen, Michel Tohme, Ryan Park, Yingping Hou, James R Bading, Peter S Conti","The alphav integrins, which act as cell adhesion molecules, are closely involved with tumor invasion and angiogenesis. In particular, alphavbeta3 integrin, which is specifically expressed on proliferating endothelial cells and tumor cells, is a logical target for development of a radiotracer method to assess angiogenesis and anti-angiogenic therapy. In this study, a dimeric cyclic RGD peptide E[c(RGDyK)]2 was labeled with 18F (t(1/2) = 109.7 min) by using a prosthetic 4-[18F]fluorobenzoyl moiety to the amino group of the glutamate. The resulting [18F]FB-E[c(RGDyK)]2, with high specific activity (200-250 GBq/micromol at the end of synthesis), was administered to subcutaneous U87MG glioblastoma xenograft models for micro-PET and autoradiographic imaging as well as direct tissue sampling to assess tumor targeting efficacy and in vivo kinetics of this PET tracer. The dimeric RGD peptide demonstrated significantly higher tumor uptake and prolonged tumor retention in comparison with a monomeric RGD peptide analog [18F]FB-c(RGDyK). The dimeric RGD peptide had predominant renal excretion, whereas the monomeric analog was excreted primarily through the biliary route. Micro-PET imaging 1 hr after injection of the dimeric RGD peptide exhibited tumor to contralateral background ratio of 9.5 +/- 0.8. The synergistic effect of polyvalency and improved pharmacokinetics may be responsible for the superior imaging characteristics of [18F]FB-E[c(RGDyK)]2.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15296674/
Experimental facts supporting a red marrow uptake due to radiometal transchelation in 90Y-DOTATOC therapy and relationship to the decrease of platelet counts,"Stephan Walrand, Raffaella Barone, Stanislas Pauwels, François Jamar","Purpose: The aim of this study was to retrospectively evaluate whether the red marrow (RM) takes up (111)In-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA)-D-Phe(1)-octreotide and (86)Y-DOTATOC and to assess the correlation between the RM absorbed doses and platelet count reduction as a biological dose estimate.

Methods: Data from 12 patients who underwent at 24 h p.i. high statistics (111)In single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and (86)Y positron emission tomography (PET) acquisitions of the chest were analysed. Uptake was measured on >7 cm spine length and converted to total RM uptake using standard RM distribution in man. RM absorbed doses were calculated assuming specific RM uptake and using the plasma and remainder of the body models. RM doses were correlated with the platelet count reduction at 4 weeks. In vitro experiments explored the metabolism of (111)In-DTPA-D-Phe(1)-octreotide and (90)Y-DOTATOC in plasma.

Results: The correlation between the uptake of both tracers was excellent (R = 0.80), indicating that RM uptake of (86)Y-DOTATOC reflects a real physiological process and not reconstruction artefacts. The kinetics of (86)Y-DOTATOC RM activity was different than that in blood and tumours, with no activity at 4 h p.i. indicating that the uptake is not somatostatin receptor dependent. In vitro experiments showed a transchelation of both radiometals to free transferrin that could explain the RM uptake. In patients without chemotherapy and with a normal platelet count recovery, a good correlation (R = 0.96) was found between the RM doses and the platelet count reduction at the nadir.

Conclusion: These experimental facts support the existence of a true RM uptake likely related to transchelation of the radiometal to transferrin. RM uptake correlates well with the observed acute RM toxicity.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21318451/
2-[18F]Fluoro- N-(2-(2-nitro-1 H-imidazol-1-yl)ethyl)acetamide,Kam Leung,"Hypoxia is found in a variety of solid tumors and leads to tumor progression and the resistance of tumors to chemotherapy and radiotherapy (1-3). Tumor oxygenation is heterogeneously distributed within human tumors (4). It would be beneficial to assess tumor oxygenation before and after therapy to provide an evaluation of tumor response to treatment and an insight into new therapeutic treatments (5). Tumor oxygenation is measured invasively using computerized, polarographic, oxygen-sensitive electrodes, which is regarded as the gold standard (6). Functional and non-invasive imaging of intratumoral hypoxia has been demonstrated to be feasible for the measurement of tumor oxygenation (7).

Chapman proposed the use of 2-nitroimidazoles for hypoxia imaging in 1979 (8). 2-Nitroimidazole compounds are postulated to undergo a reduction in hypoxic conditions, forming highly reactive oxygen radicals that subsequently bind covalently to macromolecules inside the cells (9). In normoxic conditions, the reduced molecule is rapidly reoxidized and transported from the cell. [18F]Fluoromisonidazole () is the most widely used positron emission tomography tracer for imaging tumor hypoxia (7). However, it has slow clearance kinetics and high lipophilicity, resulting in substantial background signal in PET scans. [18F]Fluoroazomycinarabinofuranoside () is a 2-nitroimidazole with a sugar addition (10) and has been studied as a hypoxia-imaging agent, showing promising results in various tumor models in rats and mice (11, 12). Zha et al. (13) reported a new [18F]-labeled 2-nitroimidazole derivative, 2-[18F]fluoro-N-(2-(2-nitro-1H-imidazol-1-yl)ethyl)acetamide ([18F]NEFA), which contains a hydrolyzable amide group forin vivohypoxic tissue imaging.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22013607/
Synthesis and Preclinical Evaluation of 11C-UCB-J as a PET Tracer for Imaging the Synaptic Vesicle Glycoprotein 2A in the Brain,"Nabeel B Nabulsi, Joël Mercier, Daniel Holden, Stephane Carré, Soheila Najafzadeh, Marie-Christine Vandergeten, Shu-Fei Lin, Anand Deo, Nathalie Price, Martyn Wood, Teresa Lara-Jaime, Florian Montel, Marc Laruelle, Richard E Carson, Jonas Hannestad, Yiyun Huang","The synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A) is found in secretory vesicles in neurons and endocrine cells. PET with a selective SV2A radiotracer will allow characterization of drugs that modulate SV2A (e.g., antiepileptic drugs) and potentially could be a biomarker of synaptic density (e.g., in neurodegenerative disorders). Here we describe the synthesis and characterization of the SV2A PET radiotracer (11)C-UCB-J ((R)-1-((3-((11)C-methyl-(11)C)pyridin-4-yl)methyl)-4-(3,4,5-trifluorophenyl)pyrrolidin-2-one) in nonhuman primates, including whole-body biodistribution.

Methods: (11)C-UCB-J was prepared by C-(11)C-methylation of the 3-pyridyl trifluoroborate precursor with (11)C-methyl iodide via the Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling method. Rhesus macaques underwent multiple scans including coinjection with unlabeled UCB-J (17, 50, and 150 μg/kg) or preblocking with the antiepileptic drug levetiracetam at 10 and 30 mg/kg. Scans were acquired for 2 h with arterial sampling and metabolite analysis to measure the input function. Regional volume of distribution (VT) was estimated using the 1-tissue-compartment model. Target occupancy was assessed using the occupancy plot; the dissociation constant (Kd) was determined by fitting self-blocking occupancies to a 1-site model, and the maximum number of receptor binding sites (Bmax) values were derived from baseline VT and from the estimated Kd and the nondisplaceable distribution volume (VND).

Results: (11)C-UCB-J was synthesized with greater than 98% purity. (11)C-UCB-J exhibited high free fraction (0.46 ± 0.02) and metabolized at a moderate rate (39% ± 5% and 24% ± 3% parent remaining at 30 and 90 min) in plasma. In the monkey brain, (11)C-UCB-J displayed high uptake and fast kinetics. VT was high (∼25-55 mL/cm(3)) in all gray matter regions, consistent with the ubiquitous expression of SV2A. Preblocking with 10 and 30 mg/kg of levetiracetam resulted in approximately 60% and 90% occupancy, respectively. Analysis of the self-blocking scans yielded a Kd estimate of 3.4 nM and Bmax of 125-350 nM, in good agreement with the in vitro inhibition constant (Ki) of 6.3 nM and regional Bmax in humans. Whole-body biodistribution revealed that the liver and the brain are the dose-limiting organs for males and females, respectively.

Conclusion: (11)C-UCB-J exhibited excellent characteristics as an SV2A PET radiotracer in nonhuman primates. The radiotracer is currently undergoing first-in-human evaluation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26848175/
Transplantation of fetal dopamine neurons in Parkinson's disease: PET [18F]6-L-fluorodopa studies in two patients with putaminal implants,"G V Sawle, P M Bloomfield, A Björklund, D J Brooks, P Brundin, K L Leenders, O Lindvall, C D Marsden, S Rehncrona, H Widner","Two patients with Parkinson's disease who underwent implantation of fetal mesencephalic tissue into the putamen were serially studied using positron emission tomography and [18F]6-L-fluorodopa ([18F]dopa). The uptake of [18F]dopa is related to the functional integrity of the presynaptic dopaminergic system. Preoperative studies revealed a marked decrease in putamen [18F]dopa uptake, with lesser involvement of the caudate. Two and 4 months, respectively, after operation, both patients demonstrated functional improvement, as described elsewhere. One patient was scanned 5, 8, and 13 months after the operation and the other was scanned 7 and 12 months after the operation. In both patients, [18F]dopa uptake increased within the operated putamen despite a progressive decrease in tracer uptake in the unoperated striatal structures. We believe that this increased uptake of [18F]dopa at the implantation site represents functional integrity within a surviving neural graft. While there has been little further clinical improvement beyond the fifth postoperative month, the uptake of [18F]dopa at the operation site in both patients has progressively increased. The kinetic data provide evidence of disease progression in the unoperated striatum, which, balanced against increasing graft function, may explain why clinical improvement reached a plateau within months after surgery.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1575455/
"Long-term exposure to oral methylphenidate or dl-amphetamine mixture in peri-adolescent rhesus monkeys: effects on physiology, behavior, and dopamine system development","Paul L Soto, Kristin M Wilcox, Yun Zhou, Anil Kumar, Nancy A Ator, Mark A Riddle, Dean F Wong, Michael R Weed","The stimulants methylphenidate and amphetamine are used to treat children with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder over important developmental periods, prompting concerns regarding possible long-term health impact. This study assessed the effects of such a regimen in male, peri-adolescent rhesus monkeys on a variety of cognitive/behavioral, physiological, and in vivo neurochemical imaging parameters. Twice daily (0900 and 1200 hours), for a total of 18 months, juvenile male monkeys (8 per group) consumed either an unadulterated orange-flavored solution, a methylphenidate solution, or a dl-amphetamine mixture. Doses were titrated to reach blood/plasma levels comparable to therapeutic levels in children. [¹¹C]MPH and [¹¹C]raclopride dynamic PET scans were performed to image dopamine transporter and D₂-like receptors, respectively. Binding potential (BP(ND)), an index of tracer-specific binding, and amphetamine-induced changes in BP(ND) of [¹¹C]raclopride were estimated by kinetic modeling. There were no consistent differences among groups on the vast majority of measures, including cognitive (psychomotor speed, timing, inhibitory control, cognitive flexibility), general activity, physiological (body weight, head circumference, crown-to-rump length), and neurochemical (ie, developmental changes in dopamine transporter, dopamine D₂ receptor density, and amphetamine-stimulated dopamine release were as expected). Cytogenetic studies indicated that neither drug was a clastogen in rhesus monkeys. Thus, methylphenidate and amphetamine at therapeutic blood/plasma levels during peri-adolescence in non-human primates have little effect on physiological or behavioral/cognitive development.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22805599/
Effects of iterative reconstruction on image contrast and lesion detection in gamma camera coincidence imaging in lung and breast cancers,"A K Paul, M Tatsumi, K Yutani, K Fujino, K Hashikawa, T Nishimura","To investigate the effects of iterative reconstruction in 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) gamma camera coincidence imaging (GCI), image contrast and visual detection obtained by using the iterative ordered-subsets expectation maximization (OSEM) reconstruction, in a phantom and in patients with lung cancer and breast cancer, were compared with those obtained by using the conventional filtered backprojection (FBP) reconstruction. Images of a cylindrical phantom containing hot spheres of various sizes (10-38 mm) were acquired by positron emission tomography (PET) and GCI at various sphere-to-background activity ratios. Forty-one consecutive patients with biopsy-proven cancer of lung (n = 20) and breast (n = 21) underwent PET and GCI on the same day after intravenous injection of 370 MBq of FDG. GCI images reconstructed by the OSEM and the FBP were compared. FDG PET was considered as the standard of reference. In GCI phantom images, OSEM yielded better contrast and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) than FBP over the range of sphere sizes. Attenuation correction improved both the image measures and sphere detection obtained by the OSEM in GCI. In the study involving patients, FDG PET depicted 41 primary tumours and 25 metastatic lymph nodes. All of the tumours >2 cm in diameter (n = 25), six of the nine tumours 1.5-2.0 cm in diameter (67%), two of seven tumours <1.5 cm in diameter (29%), and 20 metastatic lymph nodes (80%) were detected in attenuation uncorrected GCI reconstructed by the OSEM as well as the FBP. The undetected lesions in GCI were identical between the OSEM and the FBP reconstructions. OSEM yielded significantly greater tumour-to-background (T/B) ratios and lower noise than FBP in GCI (T/B ratios, 4.1+/-3.2 vs 3.7+/-2.7, P = 0.02; noise, 0.09+/-0.04 vs 0.14+/-0.05, P<0.0001). In conclusion, OSEM yielded better image contrast and less noise than the FBP in GCI, but the lesion detection obtained by the OSEM and the FBP in attenuation uncorrected GCI in patients with lung cancer and breast cancer were similar. Phantom data suggest the potential of OSEM for improving lesion detection in GCI after attenuation correction.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11748445/
Ex Vivo Radiolabeling and In Vivo PET Imaging of T Cells Expressing Nuclear Reporter Genes,"Maxim A Moroz, Pat Zanzonico, Jason T Lee, Vladimir Ponomarev","Recent advances in T cell-based immunotherapies from bench to bedside have highlighted the need for improved diagnostic imaging of T cell trafficking in vivo and the means to noninvasively investigate failures in treatment response. T cells expressing tumor-associated T cell receptors (TCRs) or engineered with chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) face multiple challenges, including possible influence of genetic engineering on T cell efficacy, inhibitory effects of the tumor microenvironment, tumor checkpoint proteins and on-target, off-tissue toxicities (Kershaw et al., Nat Rev Cancer 13:525-541, 2013; Corrigan-Curay et al., Mol Ther 22:1564-1574, 2014; June et al., Sci Trans Med 7:280-287, 2015; Whiteside et al., Clin Cancer Res 22:1845-1855, 2016; Rosenberg and Restifo, Science 348:62-68, 2015). Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with nuclear reporter genes is potentially one of the most sensitive and noninvasive methods to quantitatively track and monitor function of adoptively transferred cells in vivo. However, in vivo PET detection of T cells after administration into patients is limited by the degree of tracer accumulation per cell in situ and cell density in target tissues. We describe here a method for ex vivo radiolabeling of T cells, a reliable and robust technique for PET imaging of the kinetics of T cell biodistribution from the time of administration to subsequent localization in targeted tumors and other tissues of the body. This noninvasive technique can provide valuable information to monitor and identify the potential efficacy of adoptive cell therapies.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29858790/
1-(2'-Deoxy-2'-[18F]fluoro-β- d-arabinofuranosyl)-5-iodocytosine,Liang Shan,"The18F-labeled 1-(2'-deoxy-2'-[18F]fluoro-β-d-arabinofuranosyl)-5-iodocytosine, abbreviated as18F-FIAC, is a cytidine analog synthesized for positron emission tomography (PET) of herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1 thymidine kinase (HSV1-tk) gene expression (1, 3).

TheHSV1-tkreporter gene expression was first explored with radiolabeled nucleoside analogs by Tjuvajev et al. in 1995 to monitor the activity ofHSV1-tk(4). This study opened a new field of imaging ofHSV1-tkgene expression in gene therapy of cancer (2, 5). Since then, a large number of radiolabeled nucleoside analogs have been reported for PET imaging ofHSV1-tkreporter gene expression (2, 3). These analogs have been developed on the basis of their antiviral properties against HSV for treatment of HSV encephalitis, which involves monophosphorylation of the nucleoside analogs byHSV1-tkto their monophosphates that are subsequently converted to their di- and tri-phosphates by host kinases (1). Basically, these analogs can be divided into two major classes: pyrimidine and purine nucleoside analogs (2). The pyrimidine analogs are 2'-18F-fluoroarabinofuranisyluracil derivatives and a few other 5- and 6-substituted uracil derivatives. The purine analogs are fluorinated guanosine (acycloguanosine) derivatives. Pyrimidine analogs have two advantages over the guanosine analogs. First, pyrimidine nucleosides are more sensitive (by orders of magnitude) toHSV1-tkthan guanosine nucleosides. Second, pyrimidine analogs are mainly clearedviathe kidneys; therefore, the background activity is negligible, whereas most guanosine nucleosides are cleared through the hepatobiliary system, which leads to high radioactivity in the intestine. However, pyrimidine analogs are substrates of thymidine phosphorylase (TPase), and the glycosilic bond between the sugar and the base in the structure can be cleaved by TPase, whereas guanosine analogs are resistant to TPase; therefore, guanosine nucleosides often exhibit better tracer kinetics in this respect than the pyrimidine nucleosides. In addition, because guanosine nucleosides are not TPase substrates, they are more attractive for PET imaging of mutatedHSV1-tkreporter gene expression (6).

FIAC is a potent inhibitor of HSV virus replication. In virus-infected cells, FIAC is transformed to mono-, di-, or tri-phosphate form and incorporated into the viral DNA sequence to cause anti-viral effects at concentrations as low as 10 nM (7, 8). At the same time, FIAC exhibits limited cytotoxicity (IC50= 21.7 μM) to untransfected cells, indicating that FIAC might not be a proper substrate for the host thymidine kinase (8). These findings imply that FIAC might be an ideal probe for targeting HSV1-tk gene expression in living subjects. Chan et al. (1) tested the feasibility of18F-FIAC as a PET radiotracer for HSV1-tk gene imaging and compared it with two highly promising thymidine analogs, 2'-deoxy-2'-[18F]fluoro-5-iodo-1-β-d-arabinofuranosyluracil (18F-FIAU) and 2'-deoxy-2'-[18F]fluoro-5-ethyl-1-β-d-arabinofuranosyluracil (18F-FEAU) (9) in an NG4TL4-WT/STK sarcoma-bearing mouse model.

Quantitation of extrastriatal D2 receptors using a very high-affinity ligand (FLB 457) and the multi-injection approach,"J Delforge, M Bottlaender, C Loc'h, I Guenther, C Fuseau, B Bendriem, A Syrota, B Mazière","The multi-injection approach has been used to study in baboon the in vivo interactions between the D2 receptor sites and FLB 457, a ligand with a very high affinity for these receptors. The model structure was composed of four compartments (plasma, free ligand, and specifically and unspecifically bound ligands) and seven parameters (including the D2 receptor site density). The arterial plasma concentration, after correction for metabolites, was used as the input function. The experimental protocol, which consisted of three injections of labeled and/or unlabeled ligand, allowed the evaluation of all model parameters from a single positron emission tomography experiment. In particular, the concentration of receptor sites available for binding (B'max) and the apparent in vivo FLB 457 affinity were estimated in seven brain regions, including the cerebellum and several cortex regions, in which these parameters are estimated in vivo for the first time (B'max is estimated to be 4.0+/-1.3 pmol/mL in the thalamus and from 0.32 to 1.90 pmol/mL in the cortex). A low receptor density was found in the cerebellum (B'max = 0.39+/-0.17 pmol/mL), whereas the cerebellum is usually used as a reference region assumed to be devoid of D2 receptor sites. In spite of this very small concentration (1% of the striatal concentration), and because of the high affinity of the ligand, we demonstrated that after a tracer injection, most of the PET-measured radioactivity in the cerebellum results from the labeled ligand bound to receptor sites. The estimation of all the model parameters allowed simulations that led to a precise knowledge of the FLB 457 kinetics in all brain regions and gave the possibility of testing the equilibrium hypotheses and estimating the biases introduced by the usual simplified approaches.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10326721/
Microvascular Dysfunction Related to Progressive Left Ventricular Remodeling due to Chronic Occlusion of the Left Anterior Descending Artery in an Adult Porcine Heart,"Shin Yajima, Shigeru Miyagawa, Satsuki Fukushima, Kayako Isohashi, Tadashi Watabe, Hayato Ikeda, Genki Horitsugi, Akima Harada, Ryoto Sakaniwa, Jun Hatazawa, Yoshiki Sawa","Occlusion of a major coronary artery induces myocardial infarction (MI), leading to left ventricle (LV) remodeling due to progressive microvasculature dysfunction. Irreversible impairment in microvascular function has been suggested to extend from the infarcted region into the infarct-border or remote regions, depending on the time to revascularization. Our aim was to determine whether the occlusion of a major coronary artery induces microvascular dysfunction in the adjacent area perfused by intact coronary arteries using a porcine model for chronic total occlusion of the left anterior descending artery (LAD). MI was induced via an ameroid constrictor ring around the LAD in adult Göttingen pigs (Sus scrofa domesticus, n = 5). Age-matched normal pigs were treated as controls (n = 3). Cardiac magnetic resonance showed reduced systolic regional wall motion in the left circumflex (LCx) and right coronary artery (RCA) territories, with a progressively worsening motion in the infarction-adjacent area over an eight-week period. On13N-ammonia positron emission tomography (PET), myocardial blood flow (MBF) during hyperemia was significantly greater in the LCx and RCA territories (particularly in the infarction-adjacent area) compared to that in the LAD territory at four weeks after infarct induction. Subsequently, the flow significantly decreased, approaching that in the LAD territory at eight weeks after infarct induction. Fluoroscopy-guided pressure-wire studies showed significantly higher microvascular resistance in the LCx area at eight weeks compared to that in controls. Electron microscopy showed endothelium swelling and microvasculature disruption in areas adjacent to the LCx and RCA territories. Anterior MI caused coronary microvascular dysfunction in the adjacent area, associated with a reduced MBF and regional wall motion.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31105143/

With current technologies, aGVHD diagnosis is typically made after end-organ injury and often requires invasive tests and tissue biopsies. This affects patient prognosis as treatments are dramatically less effective at late disease stages. Here, we show that a novel PET radiotracer, 2'-deoxy-2'-[18F]fluoro-9-β-D-arabinofuranosylguanine ([18F]F-AraG), targeted toward two salvage kinase pathways preferentially accumulates in activated primary T cells. [18F]F-AraG PET imaging of a murine aGVHD model enabled visualization of secondary lymphoid organs harboring activated donor T cells prior to clinical symptoms.

Pre-clinical characterization of [11C]R05013853 as a novel radiotracer for imaging of the glycine transporter type 1 by positron emission tomography,"Edilio Borroni, Yun Zhou, Susanne Ostrowitzki, Daniela Alberati, Anil Kumar, Dominik Hainzl, Thomas Hartung, John Hilton, Robert F Dannals, Dean F Wong","A specific positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer for the glycine transporter type 1 (GlyT1) would constitute an imaging biomarker to investigate the distribution of GlyT1 in normal individuals and those with neuropsychiatric disorders. In addition it could demonstrate the ability of a novel drug to reach its target in the brain and enable receptor occupancy studies, thus facilitating drug development. In this article we describe the evaluation in non-human primates of two candidate PET radiotracers ([(11)C]RO5013852 and [(11)C]RO5013853) previously characterized in the rat. Both radiotracers showed acceptable uptake in the baboon brain and heterogeneous distribution consistent with that reported for GlyT1. In vivo blockade studies with two specific glycine reuptake inhibitors (GRIs), RO5013853 and bitopertin (RG1678, reduced uptake of both tracers to homogenous levels across brain regions and demonstrated specificity of the signal. [(11)C]RO5013853 showed a larger specific signal and slightly higher brain uptake and was therefore selected for further characterization. Quantitative compartmental analysis of PET data showed that the 2-tissue compartment model with 5 parameters was the most appropriate to describe the kinetics of [(11)C]RO5013853. Two additional methods were used: a) the Logan graphical analysis using plasma input and, b) a linear parametric imaging approach with the 2-tissue compartmental model. These produced VT estimates of comparable magnitude, namely, pons, thalamus and cerebellum>caudate, putamen and cortical regions. High resolution autoradiography with tritiated RO5013853 was used to confirm the binding pattern observed by PET. In vivo metabolism studies in the baboon demonstrated the formation of a single, radiolabeled metabolite more polar than the parent compound. Finally, [(11)C]RO5013853 was used to quantify the degree of cerebral GlyT1 occupancy observed in the baboon following oral administration of bitopertin, a selective GRI presently in Phase III clinical trial. Plasma concentrations of approximately 150-300 ng/mL were estimated to produce 50% GlyT1 occupancy in the thalamus, the cerebellum and the pons. [(11)C]RO5013853 is a promising radiotracer for in vivo imaging of the GlyT1. It can be easily radiolabeled, exhibits moderate metabolism, displays a good specific signal, and is suitable for receptor occupancy studies of therapeutic compounds that target the GlyT1. The successful characterization of [(11)C]RO5013853 in healthy volunteers is presented in this NeuroImage issue (Wong et al., 2013).",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22178811/
Stimulation-induced increases of astrocytic oxidative metabolism in rats and humans investigated with 1-11C-acetate,"Matthias T Wyss, Bruno Weber, Valerie Treyer, Stefan Heer, Luc Pellerin, Pierre J Magistretti, Alfred Buck","The purpose of this study was to investigate astrocytic oxidative metabolism using 1-(11)C-acetate. 1-(11)C-acetate kinetics were evaluated in the rat somatosensory cortex using a beta-scintillator during different manipulations (test-retest, infraorbital nerve stimulation, and administration of acetazolamide or dichloroacetate). In humans a visual activation paradigm was used and kinetics were measured with positron emission tomography. Data were analyzed using a one-tissue compartment model. The following features supported the hypothesis that washout of radiolabel (k(2)) is because of (11)C-CO(2) and therefore related to oxygen consumption (CMRO(2)): (1) the onset of (11)C washout was delayed; (2)k(2) was not affected by acetazolamide-induced blood flow increase; (3)k(2) demonstrated a significant increase during stimulation in rats (from 0.014+/-0.007 to 0.027+/-0.006 per minute) and humans (from 0.016+/-0.010 to 0.026+/-0.006 per minute); and (4) dichloroacetate led to a substantial decrease of k(2). In the test-retest experiments K(1) and k(2) were very stable. In summary, 1-(11)C-acetate seems a promising tracer to investigate astrocytic oxidative metabolism in vivo. If the washout rate indeed represents the production of (11)C-CO(2), then its increase during stimulation would point to a substantially higher astrocytic oxidative metabolism during brain activation. However, the quantitative relationship between k(2) and CMRO(2) needs to be determined in future experiments.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18714330/
Optimized dual-time-window protocols for quantitative [18F]flutemetamol and [18F]florbetaben PET studies,"Fiona Heeman, Maqsood Yaqub, Isadora Lopes Alves, Kerstin Heurling, Johannes Berkhof, Juan Domingo Gispert, Santiago Bullich, Christopher Foley, Adriaan A Lammertsma, AMYPAD Consortium","Background: A long dynamic scanning protocol may be required to accurately measure longitudinal changes in amyloid load. However, such a protocol results in a lower patient comfort and scanning efficiency compared to static scans. A compromise can be achieved by implementing dual-time-window protocols. This study aimed to optimize these protocols for quantitative [18F]flutemetamol and [18F]florbetaben studies.

Methods: Rate constants for subjects across the Alzheimer's disease spectrum (i.e., non-displaceable binding potential (BPND) in the range 0.02-0.77 and 0.02-1.04 for [18F]flutemetamol and [18F]florbetaben, respectively) were established based on clinical [18F]flutemetamol (N = 6) and [18F]florbetaben (N = 20) data, and used to simulate tissue time-activity curves (TACs) of 110 min using a reference tissue and plasma input model. Next, noise was added (N = 50) and data points corresponding to different intervals were removed from the TACs, ranging from 0 (i.e., 90-90 = full-kinetic curve) to 80 (i.e., 10-90) minutes, creating a dual-time-window. Resulting TACs were fitted using the simplified reference tissue method (SRTM) to estimate the BPND, outliers (≥ 1.5 × BPNDmax) were removed and the bias was assessed using the distribution volume ratio (DVR = BPND+ 1). To this end, acceptability curves, which display the fraction of data below a certain bias threshold, were generated and the area under those curves were calculated.

Results: [18F]Flutemetamol and [18F]florbetaben data demonstrated an increased bias in amyloid estimate for larger intervals and higher noise levels. An acceptable bias (≤ 3.1%) in DVR could be obtained with all except the 10-90 and 20-90-min intervals. Furthermore, a reduced fraction of acceptable data and most outliers were present for these two largest intervals (maximum percentage outliers 48 and 32 for [18F]flutemetamol and [18F]florbetaben, respectively).

Conclusions: The length of the interval inversely correlates with the accuracy of the BPNDestimates. Consequently, a dual-time-window protocol of 0-30 and 90-110 min (=maximum of 60 min interval) allows for accurate estimation of BPNDvalues for both tracers.

Dietary mannoheptulose does not alter glucose or lipid metabolism in adult Labrador Retrievers,"L L McKnight, J France, D Wright, G Davenport, A K Shoveller","Mannoheptulose (MH), a glycolytic inhibitor, has been preliminarily investigated as a novel functional food ingredient for dogs. This study aimed to determine the effects of dietary MH, delivered as an extract of un-ripened avocados, on fatty acid and glucose kinetics in healthy adult Labrador Retriever dogs (n = 12 dogs). The study was a double-blindcrossover with each dog receiving both dietary treatments, control (CON) and MH (400 mg/kg of diet), in random order. Glucose and glycerol plasma turnover (Ra) and oxidation (Ox) were measured in fasting and in response to repeated meal feeding (""fed"") with stable isotope tracers (U-13C-glucose, 1,1,2,3,3-D5-glycerol) and indirect calorimetry. Palmitate Ra and Ox were examined during repeated meal feeding only using an oral bolus of U-13C-K2-palmitate and indirect calorimetry. MH had no discernible effect on fasting glucose Ra (677, 722 SEM 36 μmol/min, CON, MH) or Ox (107, 109 μmol/min, CON, MH SEM 10 μmol/min) or fed glucose Ra (2913, 3626 SEM 644 μmol/min, CON, MH) or Ox (951, 936 SEM 174 μmol/min, CON, MH). Glycerol Ra, an index of the rate of lipolysis, was not different between dietary treatments (Fast 162, 113 SEM 35 μmol/min CON, MH; Fed 172, 135 SEM 21 μmol/min, CON, MH). Similarly, palmitate oxidation was not impacted by MH feeding (1966, 2276 SEM 79 μmol/min, CON, MH). Together, these findings do not support MH as a novel functional food ingredient at least at the dietary dose tested.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28444793/
Astrocyte metabolism in multiple sclerosis investigated by 1-C-11 acetate PET,"Hiroki Kato, Tatsusada Okuno, Kayako Isohashi, Toru Koda, Mikito Shimizu, Hideki Mochizuki, Yuji Nakatsuji, Jun Hatazawa","This study was aimed at evaluating the metabolism of reactive astrocytes in the brains of patients with multiple sclerosis by quantitative 1-C-11 acetate positron emission tomography (PET). Magnetic resonance imaging and 1-C-11 quantitative PET were performed in eight patients with multiple sclerosis and 10 normal control subjects. The efflux rate (k2) of 1-C-11 acetate, which reportedly reflects the metabolic rate of 1-C-11 acetate, was calculated based on the one-tissue compartmental model. Fractional anisotropy was also determined to evaluate the integrity of the neuronal tracts. The values of k2 in the patients with multiple sclerosis were significantly higher than those in the normal control subjects, in both the white matter (p= 0.003) and the gray matter (p= 0.02). In addition, the white matter/gray matter ratio of k2 was significantly higher in the multiple sclerosis patients than in the normal control subjects (p= 0.02). Voxel-based statistical analysis revealed most prominent increase in k2 in the neuronal fiber tracts, as well as decrease in fractional anisotropy in them in the multiple sclerosis patients. The present study clarified that the pathological changes associated with astrocytic reactivation in multiple sclerosis patients could be visualized by quantitative 1-C-11 acetate PET.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32169013/
[18F]CFT synthesis and binding to monoamine transporters in rats,"Sarita Forsback, Päivi Marjamäki, Olli Eskola, Jörgen Bergman, Johanna Rokka, Tove Grönroos, Merja Haaparanta, Olof Solin","Background: We present the electrophilic synthesis of [18F]2β-carbomethoxy-3β-(4-fluoro)tropane [[18F]CFT] and the pharmacological specificity and selectivity of [18F]CFT for monoamine transporters in the brain and peripheral organs of rats. The human radiation dose is extrapolated from the animal data.

Methods: [18F]CFT was synthesized by electrophilic fluorination of a stannylated precursor by using post-target-produced [18F]F2 as a fluorinating agent. The ex vivo 18F-activity biodistribution of [18F]CFT in the brain of rats was studied by autoradiography. The binding of [18F]CFT to the monoamine transporters was studied using in vivo blocking experiments with dopamine transporter [DAT], norepinephrine transporter [NET], or serotonin transporter [SERT] inhibitors. In vivo animal positron emission tomography was used as a comparative method to determine tracer kinetics. Human radiation dose was assessed using OLINDA software.

Results: The radiochemical yield of [18F]CFT from the initial [18F]F-, decay corrected to the end of bombardment, was 3.2 ± 1.0%. The specific activity [SA] was 14.5 ± 3.4 GBq/μmol, decay corrected to the end of synthesis. Radiochemical purity exceeded 99%. DAT-specific binding was found in the striatum, locus coeruleus, and pancreas. NET-specific binding was found in the locus coeruleus. SERT-specific binding was not found in any of the studied organs. Effective dose equivalent [EDE] estimated for the standard human model was 12.8 μSv/MBq. Effective dose [ED] was 9.17 μSv/MBq.

Conclusions: Post-target-produced high-SA [18F]F2 was used to incorporate18F directly into the phenyl ring of [18F]CFT. The final product had high radiochemical and chemical purities and a high SA for DAT and NET studies in vivo. In periphery, [18F]CFT showed a specific uptake in the pancreas. EDE and ED corresponded well with other18F-radioligands.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22277306/
Impact of 18F-PSMA-1007 Uptake in Prostate Cancer Using Different Peptide Concentrations: Preclinical PET/CT Study on Mice,"Fumihiko Soeda, Tadashi Watabe, Sadahiro Naka, Yuwei Liu, Genki Horitsugi, Oliver C Neels, Klaus Kopka, Mitsuaki Tatsumi, Eku Shimosegawa, Frederik L Giesel, Jun Hatazawa","PET radioligands with low molar activity (MA) may underestimate the quantity of the target of interest because of competitive binding of the target with unlabeled ligand. The aim of this study was to evaluate the change in the whole-body distribution of18F-PSMA-1007 targeting prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) when solutions with different peptide concentrations are used.Methods:Mouse xenograft models of LNCaP (PSMA-positive prostate cancer) (n= 18) were prepared and divided into 3 groups according to the peptide concentration injected: a high-MA group (1,013 ± 146 GBq/μmol;n= 6), a medium-MA group (100.7 ± 23.1 GBq/μmol;n= 6), and a low-MA group (10.80 ± 2.84 GBq/μmol;n= 6). Static PET scans were performed 1 h after injection (scan duration, 10 min). SUVmeanin tumor and normal organs was compared by the multiple-comparison test. Immunohistochemical staining and Western blot analysis were performed to confirm expression of PSMA in tumor, salivary gland, and kidney.Results:The low-MA group (SUVmean, 1.12 ± 0.30) showed significantly lower uptake of18F-PSMA-1007 in tumor than did the high-MA group (1.97 ± 0.77) and the medium-MA group (1.81 ± 0.57). On the other hand, in salivary gland, both the low-MA group (SUVmean, 0.24 ± 0.04) and the medium-MA group (0.57 ± 0.08) showed significantly lower uptake than the high MA group (1.27 ± 0.28). The tumor-to-salivary gland SUVmeanratio was 1.73 ± 0.55 in the high-MA group, 3.16 ± 0.86 in the medium-MA group, and 4.78 ± 1.29 in the low-MA group. The immunohistochemical staining and Western blot analysis revealed significant overexpression of PSMA in tumor and low expression in salivary gland and kidney.Conclusion:A decrease in the MA level of the injected18F-PSMA-1007 solution resulted in decreased uptake in tumor and, to a greater degree, in normal salivary gland. Thus, there is a possibility of minimizing the adverse effects in salivary gland by setting an appropriate MA level in PSMA-targeting therapy.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30902876/
Quantitative PET imaging and modeling of molecular blood-brain barrier permeability,"Kevin J Chung, Yasser G Abdelhafez, Benjamin A Spencer, Terry Jones, Quyen Tran, Lorenzo Nardo, Moon S Chen Jr, Souvik Sarkar, Valentina Medici, Victoria Lyo, Ramsey D Badawi, Simon R Cherry, Guobao Wang","Neuroimaging of blood-brain barrier permeability has been instrumental in identifying its broad involvement in neurological and systemic diseases. However, current methods evaluate the blood-brain barrier mainly as a structural barrier. Here we developed a non-invasive positron emission tomography method in humans to measure the blood-brain barrier permeability of molecular radiotracers that cross the blood-brain barrier through its molecule-specific transport mechanism. Our method uses high-temporal resolution dynamic imaging and kinetic modeling for multiparametric imaging and quantification of the blood-brain barrier permeability-surface area product of molecular radiotracers. We show, in humans, our method can resolve blood-brain barrier permeability across three radiotracers and demonstrate its utility in studying brain aging and brain-body interactions in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver inflammation.

Early detection of abnormal coronary flow reserve in asymptomatic men at high risk for coronary artery disease using positron emission tomography,"F Dayanikli, D Grambow, O Muzik, L Mosca, M Rubenfire, M Schwaiger","Background: The objective of this study was to compare coronary flow reserve (CFR) as a measure of vascular integrity in asymptomatic middle-aged men with family history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and a high-risk lipid profile with men without risk factors for CAD using positron emission tomography (PET). Previous studies suggested that the assessment of CFR is a sensitive means to detect vascular abnormalities before angiographic appearance of CAD. N-13 ammonia PET scanning allows noninvasive evaluation of regional and global myocardial blood flow and thereby quantification of CFR.

Methods and results: We used dynamic N-13 ammonia PET imaging in conjunction with intravenous adenosine to assess regional and global CFR in asymptomatic middle-aged men with high risk (group 1, n = 16) and men without any known risk factors (group 2, n = 11) for CAD. Group 1 patients were selected based on positive family history of CAD, one or more lipid abnormalities, and a normal stress test. No patient had history of diabetes or hypertension. A three-compartment tracer kinetic model developed and validated in our institution was used to calculate myocardial blood flow. Absolute myocardial blood flow (mL/100 g per minute) was calculated in five territories for each patient. CFR was defined as the ratio of blood flow during maximum pharmacological vasodilatation to blood flow at rest. Comparisons of CFR between the two groups of patients were performed. The mean age was similar between groups (group 1, 49.3 +/- 0.5 years; group 2, 48.1 +/- 8.7 years; P = NS). Group 1 had higher total cholesterol (mg/dL) (241 +/- 43 versus 173 +/- 34, P < .001), total cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (6.4 +/- 1.6 versus 4.1 +/- 1.4, P < .001), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (mg/dL) (167 +/- 33 versus 107 +/- 32). No group 1 patient had evidence of ischemia by exercise ECG or exercise of pharmacological radionuclide perfusion studies. The mean global absolute myocardial blood flow at rest was not significantly different among groups (group 1, 76 +/- 18; group 2, 66 +/- 8; P = NS; (in mL/100 g per minute). However, blood flow after adenosine infusion was higher for group 2 (group 1, 217 +/- 56; group 2, 264 +/- 39; P < .001), which resulted in a larger CFR for group 2 (group 1, 2.93 +/- 0.86; group 2, 4.27 +/- 0.52; P < .001). Univariate linear regression analysis revealed significant negative correlation of CFR to total cholesterol (P < .05, r = -.41), low-density lipoprotein (P < .05, r = -.38), and total cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (P < .05, r = -.47).

Conclusions: Noninvasive quantification of absolute myocardial blood flow by N-13 ammonia PET allows the detection of abnormal vasodilatory response to intravenous adenosine in male patients with family history of CAD and high-risk lipid profiles. Early assessment of alterations of vascular reactivity to adenosine in relation to high-risk lipid profiles in asymptomatic men may allow early detection of preclinical atherosclerosis and may initiate modification and/or elimination of risk factors that may slow, retard, or even reverse the progression of CAD.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8044952/
Evaluation of Integrin αvβ3 Expression in Murine Xenograft Models: [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-C(RGDfK) PET Study with Immunohistochemical Confirmation,"Kosuke Mitsuyuki, Tadashi Watabe, Sadahiro Naka, Yuwei Liu, Mitsuaki Tatsumi, Eku Shimosegawa, Hiroki Kato","Tumor blood flow (TBF) is related to drug delivery and hypoxia, both of which can impact the efficacy of anti-cancer therapies. Although integrin αvβ3expression is related to tumor angiogenesis, it remains unclear whether the degree of angiogenesis affects TBF. This study aimed to evaluate the expression of integrin αvβ3in mouse tumor models using [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-c(RGDfK) peptide positron emission tomography (PET) and immunohistochemical staining. PET studies were conducted using mouse C6 glioma models and MIA PaCa-2 (n= 6 each). The [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-c(RGDfK) peptide was injected via the tail vein (2.17 ± 0.28 MBq), and 10 min static PET scans were performed. Immunohistochemical analysis was conducted using an integrin αVβ3antibody. [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-c(RGDfK) peptide PET revealed higher uptake of the radiotracer in C6 gliomas than in MIA PaCa-2 tumors. The mean standardized uptake value was significantly higher in C6 gliomas (0.35 ± 0.058) than in MIA PaCa-2 tumors (0.17 ± 0.045). Histological analysis revealed intense integrin αVβ3expression in the C6 gliomas, whereas the MIA PaCa-2 tumors had low expression levels. This study showed that the expression of integrin αvβ3can be differentiated by the [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-c(RGDfK) peptide, suggesting the potential applicability of this peptide in the evaluation of the relationship between angiogenesis and TBF.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34359378/
Pretreatment tumor-related leukocytosis misleads positron emission tomography-computed tomography during lymph node staging in gynecological malignancies,"Seiji Mabuchi, Naoko Komura, Tomoyuki Sasano, Kotaro Shimura, Eriko Yokoi, Katsumi Kozasa, Hiromasa Kuroda, Ryoko Takahashi, Mahiru Kawano, Yuri Matsumoto, Hiroki Kato, Jun Hatazawa, Tadashi Kimura","The accuracy of fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography (18F-FDG-PET/CT) can be influenced by the increased glycolytic activity of inflammatory lesions. Here, using clinical data obtained from gynecological cancer patients, tumor samples and animal models, we investigate the impact of pretreatment tumor-related leukocytosis (TRL) on the diagnostic performance of 18F-FDG-PET/CT in detecting pelvic and paraaortic lymph node metastasis. We demonstrate that pretreatment TRL misleads 18F-FDG-PET/CT during lymph node staging in gynecological malignancies. In the mechanistic investigations, we show that the false-positive 18F-FDG-PET/CT result for detecting nodal metastasis can be reproduced in animal models of TRL-positive cancer bearing G-CSF expressing cervical cancer cells. We also show that increased 18F-FDG uptake in non-metastatic nodes can be explained by the MDSC-mediated premetastatic niche formation in which proinflammatory factors, such as S100A8 or S100A9, are abundantly expressed. Together, our results suggest that the MDSC-mediated premetastatic niche created in the lymph node of TRL-positive patients misleads 18F-FDG-PET/CT for detecting nodal metastasis.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32170086/
Quantitative imaging of the receptor for advanced glycation end-products in prostate cancer,"Christian J Konopka, Marcin Woźniak, Jamila Hedhli, Anna Siekierzycka, Jarosław Skokowski, Rafał Pęksa, Marcin Matuszewski, Gnanasekar Munirathinam, Andre Kajdacsy-Balla, Iwona T Dobrucki, Leszek Kalinowski, Lawrence W Dobrucki","Purpose: Current screening and monitoring of prostate cancer (PCa) is insufficient, producing inaccurate diagnoses. Presence of the receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) is associated with signature characteristics of PCa development such as cell proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, angiogenesis, migration, invasion, and poor patient survival. Therefore, we developed a preclinical multimodal imaging strategy targeted at RAGE to diagnose and monitor PCa.

Methods: In this work, RAGE-targeted multimodal nanoparticles (64Cu-Cy5-G4-CML) were synthesized and rendered functional for nuclear and optical imaging using previously established methods. The probe's binding affinity and targeting specificity was assessed in androgen-dependent (LNCaP) and androgen-independent (DU145) prostate cancer cells using flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. In vivo PET-CT imaging was used to evaluate RAGE levels in DU145 and LNCaP xenograft models in mice. Then, tumors were excised post-imaging for histological staining and autoradiography to further assess RAGE levels and targeting efficiency of the tracer. Finally, RAGE levels from human PCa samples of varying Gleason Scores were evaluated using Western blot and immunohistochemical staining.

Results: PCa cell culture studies confirmed adequate RAGE-targeting with 64Cu-Cy5-G4-CML with KDbetween 360 and 540 nM as measured by flow cytometry. In vivo PET-CT images of PCa xenografts revealed favorable kinetics, rapid blood clearance, and a non-homogenous, enhanced uptake in tumors, which varied based on cell type and tumor size with mean uptake between 0.5 and 1.4%ID/g. RAGE quantification of human samples confirmed increased RAGE uptake corresponding to increased Gleason scoring.

Conclusions: Our study has shown that RAGE-targeted cancer imaging is feasible and could significantly impact PCa management.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32166512/
Preclinical Evaluation and First Patient Application of 99mTc-PSMA-I&S for SPECT Imaging and Radioguided Surgery in Prostate Cancer,"Stephanie Robu, Margret Schottelius, Matthias Eiber, Tobias Maurer, Jürgen Gschwend, Markus Schwaiger, Hans-Jürgen Wester","Initial studies in patients have demonstrated the suitability of111In-PSMA-I&T (111In-DOTAGA-(3-iodo-y)-f-k-Sub(KuE)) (PSMA is prostate-specific membrane antigen and I&T is imaging and therapy) for radioguided surgery (RGS) of small metastatic prostate cancer (PCa) soft-tissue lesions. To meet the clinical need for a more cost-effective alternative, the PSMA-I&T-based tracer concept was adapted to99mTc-labeling chemistry. Two PSMA-I&T-derived inhibitors with all-L-serine- (MAS3) and all-D-serine- (mas3) chelating moieties were evaluated in parallel, and a kit procedure for routine99mTc labeling was developed.

Methods: PSMA affinities (IC50) and internalization kinetics of99mTc-MAS3-y-nal-k(Sub-KuE) and99mTc-mas3-y-nal-k(Sub-KuE) (99mTc-PSMA-I&S for imaging and surgery) were determined using LNCaP cells and (125I-BA)KuE as a radioligand and reference standard. In vivo metabolite analyses and biodistribution studies were performed using CD-1 nu/nu and LNCaP tumor-bearing CB-17 severe combined immunodeficiency mice. The pharmacokinetics of99mTc-PSMA-I&S in humans were investigated in a patient with advanced metastatic PCa via sequential planar whole-body SPECT imaging at 1, 3, 5, and 21 h after injection. Additionally, preoperative SPECT/CT (12 h after injection) and99mTc-PSMA-I&S-supported RGS (16 h after injection) were performed in 1 PCa patient with proven iliac and inguinal lymph node metastases.

Results: A robust and reliable kit-labeling procedure was established, allowing the preparation of99mTc-MAS3-y-nal-k(Sub-KuE) and99mTc-PSMA-I&S in consistently high radiochemical yield and purity (≥98%, n > 50 preparations). Because of its improved internalization efficiency and superior in vivo stability,99mTc-PSMA-I&S was selected for further in vivo evaluation. Compared with111In-PSMA-I&T,99mTc-PSMA-I&S showed delayed clearance kinetics but identical uptake in PSMA-positive tissues in the LNCaP xenograft model (1 h after injection). In exemplary PCa patients, a relatively slow whole-body clearance of99mTc-PSMA-I&S was observed due to high plasma protein binding (94%) of the tracer. This, however, promoted efficient tracer uptake in PCa lesions over time and led to steadily increasing lesion-to-background ratios up to 21 h after injection. Preoperative SPECT/CT showed a high99mTc-PSMA-I&S uptake in all suspect lesions identified in previous68Ga-HBED-CC-Ahx-KuE (68Ga-HBED-CC-PSMA) PET/CT, allowing for their successful intraoperative detection and resection during first-in-human RGS.

Conclusion: Because of a straightforward and reliable kit production,99mTc-PSMA-I&S represents a cost-effective, readily available alternative to111In-PSMA-I&T. Initial patient data indicate its comparable or even superior performance as a probe for PSMA-targeted RGS and also hint toward the unexpected potential of99mTc-PSMA-I&S as a SPECT imaging agent.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27635024/
Effect of caffeine on myocardial blood flow at rest and during pharmacological vasodilation,"M Böttcher, J Czernin, K T Sun, M E Phelps, H R Schelbert","Stress testing with intravenous injection of dipyridamole is frequently used for noninvasive detection of coronary artery disease (CAD) with PET or SPECT. Dietary intake of caffeinated food, beverages or medication might alter both resting and dipyridamole-induced hyperemic blood flow, thereby compromising the diagnostic sensitivity of dipyridamole stress testing.

Methods: To quantify the effect on myocardial blood flow at rest and during intravenous injection of dipyridamole, 12 healthy volunteers (mean age 27 +/- 6 yr) with low risk for CAD were studied with dynamic PET and a tracer kinetic model for 13N-ammonia after 24 hr of caffeine abstinence and after caffeine intake.

Results: Caffeine tended to increase the rate pressure product from 6873 +/- 1494 to 7566 +/- 1102 (p = 0.051), whereas resting myocardial blood flow remained unchanged (0.61 +/- 0.13 versus 0.58 +/- 0.07 ml/g/min, p = ns). The heart rate response to dipyridamole was inversely related to serum caffeine levels. Hyperemic blood flow (2.01 +/- 0.46 versus 1.31 +/- 0.0.38 ml/g/min; p < 0.001) and flow reserve (3.4 +/- 0.8 versus 2.3 +/- 0.7; p < 0.001) were inversely related to the caffeine dose. Coronary vascular resistance at rest tended to increase (132 +/- 32 versus 147 +/- 25 mmHg/ml/g/min; p = 0.06), whereas minimal coronary vascular resistance was significantly higher after caffeine (41 +/- 9 to 69 +/- 25 mmHg/ml/g/min; p < 0.01).

Conclusion: Caffeine intake alters the coronary vasomotor tone at rest, which might lower the threshold for ischemic events in patients with CAD. It reduces hyperemic blood flow and flow reserve and the dipyridamole-induced increase in heart rate in a dose-dependent fashion. These findings emphasize the importance of carefully screening patients for intake of caffeinated food, beverages or medication prior to dipyridamole stress testing.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7472591/

Our clinical investigation was aimed at assessing noninvasively the integrative coronary flow response to dipyridamole stress in 18 consecutive patients with microvascular angina, only moderately elevated LDL-cholesterol levels (168 +/- 33 mg/dl), and reduced vasodilator capacity despite normal (n = 9) or slightly abnormal (n = 9) coronary arteriograms (minimal disease with luminal irregularities and/or diameter reduction < or = 30%) before and after 6-month lipid-lowering therapy (simvastatin).

Methods: Regional and averaged myocardial blood flow were measured at rest and after dipyridamole induced vasodilation (0.56 mg/kg) using dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) and N-13 ammonia as flow tracer related to a 3-compartment kinetic model. Baseline data (mean +/- SD): 13 males, 5 females; mean age: 56 +/- 8 years; basal coronary flow: 90 +/- 22 ml/min x 100 g; after lipid intervention: 93 +/- 18 ml/min x 100 g (n.s.). Total cholesterol: 246 +/- 45 mg/dl. RESULTS AFTER 6-MONTH LIPID INTERVENTION: Total cholesterol decreased to 170 +/- 36 mg/dl (p < 0.001); mean LDL level: 97 +/- 26 mg/dl (p < 0.001). Coronary dilator capacity increased, assessed in terms of minimal coronary resistance: 0.38 +/- 0.08 vs 0.49 +/- 0.09 units at baseline (p < 0.01), myocardial blood flow under dipyridamole: 232 +/- 43 vs 186 +/- 37 ml/min x 100 g at baseline (p < 0.01), and instantaneous flow ratio: 2.6 +/- 0.7 vs 2.2 +/- 0.6 (p = 0.06). Concomitantly, a considerable regression of angina was noticed in the majority of patients.

Conclusions: An improvement of the non-invasively determined integrative dipyridamole induced coronary vasodilator capacity may be achieved after 6 months by intensive lipid lowering at a very early stage of coronary atherosclerosis. Consequently, aggressive cholesterol-lowering therapy represents an antiischemic and antianginal approach suggesting, at least in part, functional reversal and probably prevention of further disease progression.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9827472/
Immuno-PET Monitoring of CD8+ T Cell Infiltration Post ICOS Agonist Antibody Treatment Alone and in Combination with PD-1 Blocking Antibody Using a 89Zr Anti-CD8+ Mouse Minibody in EMT6 Syngeneic Tumor Mouse,"Hasan Alsaid, Shih-Hsun Cheng, Meixia Bi, Fang Xie, Mary Rambo, Tinamarie Skedzielewski, Bao Hoang, Sunish Mohanan, Debra Comroe, Andrew Gehman, Chih-Yang Hsu, Kamyar Farhangi, Hoang Tran, Valeriia Sherina, Minh Doan, M Reid Groseclose, Christopher B Hopson, Sara Brett, Ian A Wilson, Andrew Nicholls, Marc Ballas, Jeremy D Waight, Beat M Jucker","Purpose: The presence and functional competence of intratumoral CD8+T cells is often a barometer for successful immunotherapeutic responses in cancer. Despite this understanding and the extensive number of clinical-stage immunotherapies focused on potentiation (co-stimulation) or rescue (checkpoint blockade) of CD8+T cell antitumor activity, dynamic biomarker strategies are often lacking. To help fill this gap, immuno-PET nuclear imaging has emerged as a powerful tool for in vivo molecular imaging of antibody targeting. Here, we took advantage of immuno-PET imaging using89Zr-IAB42M1-14, anti-mouse CD8 minibody, to characterize CD8+T-cell tumor infiltration dynamics following ICOS (inducible T-cell co-stimulator) agonist antibody treatment alone and in combination with PD-1 blocking antibody in a model of mammary carcinoma.

Procedures: Female BALB/c mice with established EMT6 tumors received 10 µg, IP of either IgG control antibodies, ICOS agonist monotherapy, or ICOS/PD-1 combination therapy on days 0, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10, or 14. Imaging was performed at 24 and 48 h post IV dose of89Zr IAB42M1-14. In addition to89Zr-IAB42M1-14 uptake in tumor and tumor-draining lymph node (TDLN), 3D radiomic features were extracted from PET/CT images to identify treatment effects. Imaging mass cytometry (IMC) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed at end of study.

Results: 89Zr-IAB42M1-14 uptake in the tumor was observed by day 11 and was preceded by an increase in the TDLN as early as day 4. The spatial distribution of89Zr-IAB42M1-14 was more uniform in the drug treated vs. control tumors, which had spatially distinct tracer uptake in the periphery relative to the core of the tumor. IMC analysis showed an increased percentage of cytotoxic T cells in the ICOS monotherapy and ICOS/PD-1 combination group compared to IgG controls. Additionally, temporal radiomics analysis demonstrated early predictiveness of imaging features.

Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first detailed description of the use of a novel immune-PET imaging technique to assess the kinetics of CD8+T-cell infiltration into tumor and lymphoid tissues following ICOS agonist and PD-1 blocking antibody therapy. By demonstrating the capacity for increased spatial and temporal resolution of CD8+T-cell infiltration across tumors and lymphoid tissues, these observations underscore the widespread potential clinical utility of non-invasive PET imaging for T-cell-based immunotherapy in cancer.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36266600/
Dual integrin and gastrin-releasing peptide receptor targeted tumor imaging using 18F-labeled PEGylated RGD-bombesin heterodimer 18F-FB-PEG3-Glu-RGD-BBN,"Zhaofei Liu, Yongjun Yan, Frederic T Chin, Fan Wang, Xiaoyuan Chen","Radiolabeled RGD and bombesin peptides have been extensively investigated for tumor integrin alpha(v)beta(3) and GRPR imaging, respectively. Due to the fact that many tumors are both integrin and GRPR positive, we designed and synthesized a heterodimeric peptide Glu-RGD-BBN, which is expected to be advantageous over the monomeric peptides for dual-receptor targeting. A PEG(3) spacer was attached to the glutamate alpha-amino group of Glu-RGD-BBN to enhance the (18)F labeling yield and to improve the in vivo kinetics. PEG(3)-Glu-RGD-BBN possesses the comparable GRPR and integrin alpha(v)beta(3) receptor-binding affinities as the corresponding monomers, respectively. The dual-receptor targeting properties of (18)F-FB-PEG(3)-Glu-RGD-BBN were observed in PC-3 tumor model. (18)F-FB-PEG(3)-Glu-RGD-BBN with high tumor contrast and favorable pharmacokinetics is a promising PET tracer for dual integrin and GRPR positive tumor imaging. This heterodimer strategy may also be an applicable method to develop other molecules with improved in vitro and in vivo characterizations for tumor diagnosis and therapy.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19113865/
[18F]DPA-714 PET imaging shows immunomodulatory effect of intravenous administration of bone marrow stromal cells after transient focal ischemia,"Chengbo Tan, Songji Zhao, Kei Higashikawa, Zifeng Wang, Masahito Kawabori, Takeo Abumiya, Naoki Nakayama, Ken Kazumata, Naoyuki Ukon, Hironobu Yasui, Nagara Tamaki, Yuji Kuge, Hideo Shichinohe, Kiyohiro Houkin","Background: The potential application of bone marrow stromal cell (BMSC) therapy in stroke has been anticipated due to its immunomodulatory effects. Recently, positron emission tomography (PET) with [18F]DPA-714, a translocator protein (TSPO) ligand, has become available for use as a neural inflammatory indicator. We aimed to evaluate the effects of BMSC administration after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) using [18F]DPA-714 PET. The BMSCs or vehicle were administered intravenously to rat MCAO models at 3 h after the insult. Neurological deficits, body weight, infarct volume, and histology were analyzed. [18F]DPA-714 PET was performed 3 and 10 days after MCAO.

Results: Rats had severe neurological deficits and body weight loss after MCAO. Cell administration ameliorated these effects as well as the infarct volume. Although weight loss occurred in the spleen and thymus, cell administration suppressed it. In both vehicle and BMSC groups, [18F]DPA-714 PET showed a high standardized uptake value (SUV) around the ischemic area 3 days after MCAO. Although SUV was increased further 10 days after MCAO in both groups, the increase was inhibited in the BMSC group, significantly. Histological analysis showed that an inflammatory reaction occurred in the lymphoid organs and brain after MCAO, which was suppressed in the BMSC group.

Conclusions: The present results suggest that BMSC therapy could be effective in ischemic stroke due to modulation of systemic inflammatory responses. The [18F]DPA-714 PET/CT system can accurately demonstrate brain inflammation and evaluate the BMSC therapeutic effect in an imaging context. It has great potential for clinical application.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29717383/
Brain kinetics of methylphenidate (Ritalin) enantiomers after oral administration,"Yu-Shin Ding, S John Gatley, Panayotis K Thanos, Colleen Shea, Victor Garza, Youwen Xu, Pauline Carter, Payton King, Don Warner, Nicholas B Taintor, Daniel J Park, Bea Pyatt, Joanna S Fowler, Nora D Volkow","Methylphenidate (MP) (Ritalin) is widely used for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It is a chiral drug, marketed as the racemic mixture of d- and l-threo enantiomers. Our previous studies (PET and microdialysis) in humans, baboons, and rats confirm the notion that pharmacological specificity of MP resides predominantly in the d-isomer. A recent report that intraperitoneally (i.p.) administered l-threo-MP displayed potent, dose-dependent inhibition of cocaine- or apomorphine-induced locomotion in rats, raises the question of whether l-threo-MP has a similar effect when given orally. It has been speculated that l-threo-MP is poorly absorbed in humans when it is given orally because of rapid presystemic metabolism. To investigate whether l-threo-MP or its metabolites can be delivered to the brain when it is given orally, and whether l-threo-MP is pharmacologically active. PET and MicroPET studies were carried out in baboons and rats using orally delivered C-11-labeled d- and l-threo-MP ([methyl-(11)C]d-threo-MP and [methyl-(11)C]l-threo-MP). In addition, we assessed the effects of i.p. l-threo-MP on spontaneous and cocaine-stimulated locomotor activity in mice. There was a higher global uptake of carbon-11 in both baboon and rat brain for oral [(11)C]l-threo-MP than for oral [(11)C]d-threo-MP. Analysis of the chemical form of radioactivity in rat brain after [(11)C]d-threo-MP indicated mainly unchanged tracer, whereas with [(11)C]l-threo-MP, it was mainly a labeled metabolite. The possibility that this labeled metabolite might be [(11)C]methanol or [(11)C]CO(2), derived from demethylation, was excluded by ex vivo studies in rats. When l-threo-MP was given i.p. to mice at a dose of 3 mg/kg, it neither stimulated locomotor activity nor inhibited the increased locomotor activity due to cocaine administration. These results suggest that, in animal models, l-threo-MP or its metabolite(s) is (are) absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and enters the brain after oral administration, but that l-threo-MP may not be pharmacologically active. These results are pertinent to the question of whether l-threo-MP contributes to the behavioral and side effect profile of MP during treatment of ADHD.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15236349/
"In vivo imaging of baboon and human dopamine transporters by positron emission tomography using [11C]WIN 35,428","D F Wong, B Yung, R F Dannals, E K Shaya, H T Ravert, C A Chen, B Chan, T Folio, U Scheffel, G A Ricaurte","[11C]WIN 35,428 was evaluated as a specific in vivo radioligand for the dopamine transporter site by PET scanning in nonhuman primates and humans. In studies with a baboon (Papio anubis), [11C]WIN 35,428 accumulated in brain regions containing dopamine transporters, i.e., the striata. This accumulation was partially blocked by prior administration of (-)cocaine (4 mg/kg, i.v.). Placement of a unilateral lesion of dopamine-containing nerve terminals with MPTP resulted in a unilateral reduction in [11C]WIN 35,428 accumulation in the striatum on the side of the lesion. Imaging of D2 dopamine receptors with [11C]NMSP in the same MPTP-treated animals showed much less reduction in the postsynaptic D2 dopamine receptors as compared to the much larger reduction in the dopamine transporters labeled with [11C]WIN 35,428. A total of ten normal human volunteers (five males and five females) with ages ranging from 19 to 81 years were studied. The caudate/cerebellar and putamen/cerebellar ratios ranged from 4.4 to 5.7 90 min after injection of the tracer. Preliminary kinetic modeling with arterial plasma sampling resulted in an average binding potential (k3/k4) of 4.98 in the caudate nucleus and 5.13 in putamen. To demonstrate in vivo blockade with dopamine reuptake inhibitors, two subjects received prior oral doses of 6 mg mazindol. Subject 5 had significant reductions of 29% in the caudate/cerebellar ratio at 90 min, 35% in the putamen/cerebellar ratio at 90 min, 45% in the caudate k3/k4 ratio from 6.7 to 3.7, and 46% in the putamen k3/k4 from 4.7 to 2.5. Subject 8 had significant reductions of 20% in both the caudate/cerebellar ratio and the putamen/cerebellar ratio at 90 min. During the human PET studies, a number of neuropsychological tests and physiological measurements were performed. No significant changes were found after administration of the [11C]WIN 35,428 alone. Taken together, these data indicate that [11C]WIN 35,428 is a promising radioligand for future studies of neuropsychiatric disorders that involve the dopamine transporter site.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8259524/
Development and evaluation of 18F-labeled novel radiopharmaceuticals for PET imaging of fibroblast activation protein expressing tumors,"Qingyu Zhang, Zhoumi Hu, Haitao Zhao, Fuqiang Du, Chun Lv, Tukang Peng, Yukai Zhang, Bowu Zhang, Jianjun Liu, Cheng Wang","This study aimed to develop and evaluate two novel18F-labeled radiopharmaceuticals, [18F]AlF-NOTA-De-FAPI and [18F]AlF-NOTA-Glu-FAPI, for Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging of tumors expressing fibroblast activation protein. Molecular docking simulations predicted the binding affinities of NOTA-De-FAPI and NOTA-Glu-FAPI with FAP. The radiotracers were synthesized and evaluated for radiochemical yield, purity, and molar activity. Surface plasmon resonance analysis measured binding kinetics. In vitro and in vivo stability and distribution coefficients were assessed. PET/CT imaging and ex vivo biodistribution studies were conducted in U87MG tumor-bearing mice. A pilot clinical study compared [18F]AlF-NOTA-De-FAPI with [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-FAPI-04 and [18F]FDG in a liver cancer patient. Molecular docking simulations showed that NOTA-De-FAPI had a slightly higher binding affinity for FAP. The radiotracers were synthesized with high purity and molar activity. SPR analysis confirmed higher binding affinity of NOTA-De-FAPI (KD= 86.35 pM) compared to NOTA-Glu-FAPI (KD= 187 pM). In PET/CT imaging, [18F]AlF-NOTA-De-FAPI demonstrated higher tumor uptake in U87MG tumor-bearing mice, with a peak SUVmaxof 2.71 ± 0.39 at 1 h post-injection. Ex vivo biodistribution studies showed that [18F]AlF-NOTA-De-FAPI had a tumor uptake of 9.16 ± 0.49 %ID/g at 1 h post-injection, significantly higher than [18F]AlF-NOTA-Glu-FAPI (6.60 ± 0.82 %ID/g). In the clinical study, [18F]AlF-NOTA-De-FAPI showed strong uptake in the primary tumor but exhibited higher physiological uptake in salivary glands, thyroid, and pancreas compared to [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-FAPI-04. [18F]AlF-NOTA-De-FAPI demonstrated potential as a FAP-targeting tracer with high specific uptake and favorable tumor-to-normal tissue ratios in preclinical models. However, clinical evaluation revealed limitations, such as high physiological uptake in certain glands and lower tumor uptake compared to [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-FAPI-04.

18F-FSPG PET/CT Imaging of System xC- Transporter Activity in Patients with Primary and Metastatic Brain Tumors,"Mirwais Wardak, Ida Sonni, Audrey P Fan, Ryogo Minamimoto, Mehran Jamali, Negin Hatami, Greg Zaharchuk, Nancy Fischbein, Seema Nagpal, Gordon Li, Norman Koglin, Mathias Berndt, Santiago Bullich, Andrew W Stephens, Ludger M Dinkelborg, Ty Abel, H Charles Manning, Jarrett Rosenberg, Frederick T Chin, Sanjiv Sam Gambhir, Erik S Mittra","Background The PET tracer (4S)-4-(3-[18F]fluoropropyl)-l-glutamate (18F-FSPG) targets the system xC-cotransporter, which is overexpressed in various tumors. Purpose To assess the role of18F-FSPG PET/CT in intracranial malignancies. Materials and Methods Twenty-six patients (mean age, 54 years ± 12; 17 men; 48 total lesions) with primary brain tumors (n= 17) or brain metastases (n= 9) were enrolled in this prospective, single-center study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier:NCT02370563) between November 2014 and March 2016. A 30-minute dynamic brain18F-FSPG PET/CT scan and a static whole-body (WB)18F-FSPG PET/CT scan at 60-75 minutes were acquired. Moreover, all participants underwent MRI, and four participants underwent fluorine 18 (18F) fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET imaging. PET parameters and their relative changes were obtained for all lesions. Kinetic modeling was used to estimate the18F-FSPG tumor rate constants using the dynamic and dynamic plus WB PET data. Imaging parameters were correlated to lesion outcomes, as determined with follow-up MRI and/or pathologic examination. The Mann-WhitneyUtest or Studentttest was used for group mean comparisons. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used for performance comparison of different decision measures. Results18F-FSPG PET/CT helped identify all 48 brain lesions. The mean tumor-to-background ratio (TBR) on the whole-brain PET images at the WB time point was 26.6 ± 24.9 (range: 2.6-150.3). When18F-FDG PET was performed,18F-FSPG permitted visualization of non-18F-FDG-avid lesions or allowed better lesion differentiation from surrounding tissues. In participants with primary brain tumors, the predictive accuracy of the relative changes in influx rate constant Kiand maximum standardized uptake value to discriminate between poor and good lesion outcomes were 89% and 81%, respectively. There were significant differences in the18F-FSPG uptake curves of lesions with good versus poor outcomes in the primary brain tumor group (P< .05) but not in the brain metastases group. Conclusion PET/CT imaging with (4S)-4-(3-[18F]fluoropropyl)-l-glutamate (18F-FSPG) helped detect primary brain tumors and brain metastases with a high tumor-to-background ratio. Relative changes in18F-FSPG uptake with multi-time-point PET appear to be helpful in predicting lesion outcomes.

Increased intratumoral fluorothymidine uptake levels following multikinase inhibitor sorafenib treatment in a human renal cell carcinoma xenograft model,"Masahiro Murakami, Songji Zhao, Yan Zhao, Wenwen Yu, Chowdhury Nusrat Fatema, Ken-Ichi Nishijima, Masahiro Yamasaki, Mitsuyoshi Takiguchi, Nagara Tamaki, Yuji Kuge","An early identification of the tumor response to sorafenib treatment is indispensable for selecting optimal personalized treatment strategies. However, at present, no reliable predictors are clinically available.18F-fluorothymidine (18F-FLT) positron emission tomography (PET) is used to assess tumor proliferation, since the FLT uptake level reflects thymidine kinase-1 (TK-1) activity. Thus, the present study determined whether FLT was able to evaluate the early tumor response to sorafenib treatment in a human renal cell carcinoma (RCC; A498) xenograft in comparison with the tumor proliferation marker, Ki-67. Mice bearing A498 tumors were assigned to the control and sorafenib-treated groups and the tumor volume was measured every day. [Methyl-3H(N)]-3'-fluoro-3'-deoxythymidine (3H-FLT) was injected 2 h prior to the sacrifice of the mice on days three and seven following the treatment.3H-FLT autoradiography (ARG) and Ki-67 immunohistochemistry (IHC) were performed using adjacent tumor sections. In the visual assessment, the intratumoral3H-FLT uptake level diffusely increased following the treatment, while no significant changes were observed in Ki-67 IHC. The intratumoral3H-FLT uptake levels significantly increased by 2.7- and 2.6-fold on days three and seven following the treatment, while the tumor volume and Ki-67 index did not significantly change. Thus, an increased FLT uptake level was demonstrated following the treatment, which may indicate the suppression of thymidylate synthase (TS) and the compensatory upregulation of TK-1 activity by sorafenib.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24137387/
Movement correction method for human brain PET images: application to quantitative analysis of dynamic 18F-FDDNP scans,"Mirwais Wardak, Koon-Pong Wong, Weber Shao, Magnus Dahlbom, Vladimir Kepe, Nagichettiar Satyamurthy, Gary W Small, Jorge R Barrio, Sung-Cheng Huang","Head movement during a PET scan (especially a dynamic scan) can affect both the qualitative and the quantitative aspects of an image, making it difficult to accurately interpret the results. The primary objective of this study was to develop a retrospective image-based movement correction (MC) method and evaluate its implementation on dynamic 2-(1-{6-[(2-(18)F-fluoroethyl)(methyl)amino]-2-naphthyl}ethylidene)malononitrile ((18)F-FDDNP) PET images of cognitively intact controls and patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD).

Methods: Dynamic (18)F-FDDNP PET images, used for in vivo imaging of beta-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, were obtained from 12 AD patients and 9 age-matched controls. For each study, a transmission scan was first acquired for attenuation correction. An accurate retrospective MC method that corrected for transmission-emission and emission-emission misalignments was applied to all studies. No restriction was assumed for zero movement between the transmission scan and the first emission scan. Logan analysis, with the cerebellum as the reference region, was used to estimate various regional distribution volume ratio (DVR) values in the brain before and after MC. Discriminant analysis was used to build a predictive model for group membership, using data with and without MC.

Results: MC improved the image quality and quantitative values in (18)F-FDDNP PET images. In this subject population, no significant difference in DVR value was observed in the medial temporal (MTL) region of controls and patients with AD before MC. However, after MC, significant differences in DVR values in the frontal, parietal, posterior cingulate, MTL, lateral temporal (LTL), and global regions were seen between the 2 groups (P < 0.05). In controls and patients with AD, the variability of regional DVR values (as measured by the coefficient of variation) decreased on average by more than 18% after MC. Mean DVR separation between controls and patients with AD was higher in frontal, MTL, LTL, and global regions after MC. Group classification by discriminant analysis based on (18)F-FDDNP DVR values was markedly improved after MC.

Conclusion: The streamlined and easy-to-use MC method presented in this work significantly improves the image quality and the measured tracer kinetics of (18)F-FDDNP PET images. The proposed MC method has the potential to be applied to PET studies on patients having other disorders (e.g., Down syndrome and Parkinson's disease) and to brain PET scans with other molecular imaging probes.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20080894/
Theranostics Targeting Fibroblast Activation Protein in the Tumor Stroma: 64Cu- and 225Ac-Labeled FAPI-04 in Pancreatic Cancer Xenograft Mouse Models,"Tadashi Watabe, Yuwei Liu, Kazuko Kaneda-Nakashima, Yoshifumi Shirakami, Thomas Lindner, Kazuhiro Ooe, Atsushi Toyoshima, Kojiro Nagata, Eku Shimosegawa, Uwe Haberkorn, Clemens Kratochwil, Atsushi Shinohara, Frederik Giesel, Jun Hatazawa","Fibroblast activation protein (FAP), which promotes tumor growth and progression, is overexpressed in cancer-associated fibroblasts of many human epithelial cancers. Because of its low expression in normal organs, FAP is an excellent target for theranostics. In this study, we used radionuclides with relatively long half-lives,64Cu (half-life, 12.7 h) and225Ac (half-life, 10 d), to label FAP inhibitors (FAPIs) in mice with human pancreatic cancer xenografts.Methods:Male nude mice (body weight, 22.5 ± 1.2 g) were subcutaneously injected with human pancreatic cancer cells (PANC-1,n= 12; MIA PaCa-2,n= 8). Tumor xenograft mice were investigated after the intravenous injection of64Cu-FAPI-04 (7.21 ± 0.46 MBq) by dynamic and delayed PET scans (2.5 h after injection). Static scans 1 h after the injection of68Ga-FAPI-04 (3.6 ± 1.4 MBq) were also acquired for comparisons using the same cohort of mice (n= 8). Immunohistochemical staining was performed to confirm FAP expression in tumor xenografts using an FAP-α-antibody. For radioligand therapy,225Ac-FAPI-04 (34 kBq) was injected into PANC-1 xenograft mice (n= 6). Tumor size was monitored and compared with that of control mice (n= 6).Results:Dynamic imaging of64Cu-FAPI-04 showed rapid clearance through the kidneys and slow washout from tumors. Delayed PET imaging of64Cu-FAPI-04 showed mild uptake in tumors and relatively high uptake in the liver and intestine. Accumulation levels in the tumor or normal organs were significantly higher for64Cu-FAPI-04 than for68Ga-FAPI-04, except in the heart, and excretion in the urine was higher for68Ga-FAPI-04 than for64Cu-FAPI-04. Immunohistochemical staining revealed abundant FAP expression in the stroma of xenografts.225Ac-FAPI-04 injection showed significant tumor growth suppression in the PANC-1 xenograft mice, compared with the control mice, without a significant change in body weight.Conclusion:This proof-of-concept study showed that64Cu-FAPI-04 and225Ac-FAPI-04 could be used in theranostics for the treatment of FAP-expressing pancreatic cancer. α-therapy targeting FAP in the cancer stroma is effective and will contribute to the development of a new treatment strategy.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31586001/
Total-body parametric imaging using the Patlak model: Feasibility of reduced scan time,"Yaping Wu, Tao Feng, Yu Shen, Fangfang Fu, Nan Meng, Xiaochen Li, Tianyi Xu, Tao Sun, Fengyun Gu, Qi Wu, Yun Zhou, Hui Han, Yan Bai, Meiyun Wang","Purpose: This study explored the feasibility of reducing the scan time of Patlak parametric imaging on the uEXPLORER.

Methods: A total of 65 patients (27 females and 38 males, age 56.1 ± 10.4) were recruited in this study. 18F fluorodeoxyglucose was injected, and its dose was adjusted by body weight (4.07 MBq/kg). Total-body dynamic scanning was performed on the uEXPLORER total-body Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (CT) scanner with a total scan time of 60 min from the injection. The image derived input function (IDIF) was obtained from the aortic arch. The voxelwise Patlak analysis was applied to generate the Kiimages designated as GIDIFwith different acquisition times (20-60, 30-60, 40-60, and 44-60 min). The population-based input function (PBIF) was constructed from the mean value of the IDIF from the population, and Kiimages designated as GPBIFwere generated using the PBIF. Nonlocalmeans (NLM) denoising was applied to the generated images to get two extra groups of (NLM-designated) images: GIDIF+NLMand GPBIF+NLM. Two radiologists evaluated the overall image quality, noise, and lesion detectability of the Kiimages from different groups. The 20-60 min scans in GIDIFwere selected as the gold standard for each patient. We determined that image quality is at sufficient level if all the lesions can be recognized and meet the clinical criteria. Kivalues in muscle and lesion were compared across different groups to evaluate the quantitative accuracy.

Results: The overall image quality, image noise, and lesion conspicuity were significantly better in long time series than short time series in all four groups (all p < 0.001). The Kiimages in the GIDIFand GPBIFgroups generated from 30-min scans showed diagnostic value equivalent to the 40-min scans of GIDIF. While the image quality of the 16-min scans was poor, all lesions could still be detected. No significant difference was found between Kivalues estimated with GIDIFand GPBIFin muscle and lesion regions (all p > 0.5). After applying the NLM filter, the coefficient of variation could be reduced on the order of (1%, 15%, 19%, and 37%) and (110%, 125%, 94%, and 69%) with four acquisition time schemes for lesion and muscle. The reduction percentage did not have a substantial difference in IDIF and PBIF group. The Kiimages in the GIDIF+NLMand GPBIF+NLMgroups generated from the 20-min acquisitions showed acceptable quality. All lesions could be found on the NLM processed images of the 16-min scans. No significant difference was found between Kivalues produced with GIDIF+NLMand GPBIF+NLMin muscle and lesion regions(all p > 0.7).

Conclusions: The Kiimages generated by the PBIF-based Patlak model using a 20-min dynamic scan with the NLM filter achieved a similar diagnostic efficiency to images with GIDIFfrom 40-min dynamic data, and there is no significant difference between Kiimages generated using IDIF or PBIF (p > 0.5).",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35394071/
Methyl ester of 1- O-(4-(2-[18F]fluoroethyl-carbamoyloxymethyl)-2-nitrophenyl)- O-β- d-glucopyronuronate,Arvind Chopra,"The β-glucuronidase (β-GUS; EC 3.2.1.31) is a lysosomal enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of β-glucuronic acid residues from the cell-surface glycosaminoglycans for normal reconstruction of the extracellular matrix (ECM) (1), and the enzyme is believed to participate in the processes of angiogenesis, cancer metastasis, and inflammation (2). The β-GUS is known to activate prodrugs (PDs) for the treatment of cancer. β-GUS also has been used to track the path of gene delivery vehicles, and there is evidence that it can be used as a biomarker to detect cancerous tumors (3). Normal tissues have low levels of β-GUS in the ECM, but tissues under pathological stress, such as bacterial infection, fibrosis, and malignancy, show elevated levels of the enzyme (4). As a result of cell lysis, intracellular β-GUS is released from the necrotic parts of neoplastic tumors, and its activity in these lesions has been utilized for thein situactivation of anti-cancer PDs to treat cancers (1). Because chemotherapeutic anti-cancer drugs are non-selectively toxic to healthy cells, they are generally of limited efficacy to the patient due to their undesirable side effects on the normal biological systems. The conversion of a toxic drug into a non-toxic PD that can be activated only under specific conditions (e.g., by enzyme catalysis or chemical hydrolysis) would facilitate drug activation only in tissues that provide the specialized microenvironment and improve its concentration and efficacy at the desired location in the body (5, 6). For example, glucuronide PDs (drugs that are linked to a glucuronic acid moiety with or without a linker) have been shown to have superior anti-tumor activity compared with the parent drugs because the activated drugs are released from the PDs by the β-GUS activity in a site-specific manner (7, 8).

β-GUS activity varies among individuals, and its expression or accumulation in tumor tissues may change depending on the type of neoplasm or the location in the body (1, 9). Fluorescent or bioluminescent substrates were developed to determine the expression of β-GUS with optical imaging in the various tissues of mice (3). However, this imaging modality is suitable for the detection of fluorescence or bioluminescence signals generated only in the superficial tissues of small animals such as rodents; the low depth of light penetration in tissues is a limitation for its application in large animals and humans (1, 4, 10). Imaging modalities such as positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), which use radionuclides to generate tracer signals, can be used to detect and determine the activity of enzymes such as the β-GUS because signals generated by radiolabeled probes can be detected even in deep locations in the body (11). In general, PET imaging has a higher sensitivity than SPECT and has been used to investigate drug kinetics in preclinical and clinical settings (11).

Antunes et al. synthesized 1-O-(4-(2-[18F]fluoroethyl-carbamoyloxymethyl)-2-nitrophenyl)-O-β-d-glucopyronuronate ([18F]-FEAnGA) as a PD in an effort to develop a probe that could be used with PET to detect and visualize β-GUS activity in tumors (1, 4) and inflamed tissues (1, 10) in rodents. The mechanism ofin vitro/in vivoactivation of [18F]-FEAnGA is described elsewhere (4). Although [18F]-FEAnGA could be used to detect β-GUS activity and distinguish cancerous tumors or inflamed tissues from the surrounding normal tissues, only low levels of radioactivity were detected in the tumorous or inflamed areas compared with the healthy tissues. The investigators concluded that the low accumulation of label in the lesions was due to the high hydrophilicity of the PD and its rapid clearance from the body through the kidneys (1). It has been shown that conversion of anti-cancer PDs to their methyl esters renders them considerably less hydrophilic and increases the circulation half-life of the PD because the methylated-PD first has to be demethylated by an esterase (to produce the PD) while in circulation before the active drug could be released from the PD by another enzyme(s) such as the β-GUS at the desired site(s) in the body (12). On the basis of these observations, a [18F]-fluoride-labeled methyl ester of FEAnGA was synthesized ([18F]-FEAnGA-Me) and evaluated for the imaging of β-GUS activity in a rodent tumor/inflammation model (12). Briefly, a carboxylesterase in the plasma hydrolyzes [18F]-FEAnGA-Me to [18F]-FEAnGA, which is a substrate for the β-GUS, and its subsequent hydrolysis by the enzyme results in the production of glucuronic acid, 4-hydroxy-3-nitrobenzyl alcohol (HNBA; acts as a spacer moiety in the intact [18F]-FEAnGA, and the concentration of this molecule in the reaction mixture can be measured with ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopy at 402 nm after the hydrolysis of FEAnGA), and 2-[18F]fluoroethylamine ([18F]-FEA). Subsequently, [18F]-FEA can be detected with PET imaging because it accumulates in the cells by passive diffusion (10).",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22553889/
First-in-Humans Brain PET Imaging of the GluN2B-Containing N-methyl-d-aspartate Receptor with (R)-11C-Me-NB1,"Lucas Rischka, Chrysoula Vraka, Verena Pichler, Sazan Rasul, Lukas Nics, Gregor Gryglewski, Patricia Handschuh, Matej Murgaš, Godber M Godbersen, Leo R Silberbauer, Jakob Unterholzner, Christoph Wotawa, Achi Haider, Hazem Ahmed, Roger Schibli, Thomas Mindt, Markus Mitterhauser, Wolfgang Wadsak, Andreas Hahn, Rupert Lanzenberger, Marcus Hacker, Simon M Ametamey","TheN-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) plays a crucial role in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease and in the treatment of major depression by fast-acting antidepressants such as ketamine. Given their broad implications, GluN2B-containing NMDARs have been of interest as diagnostic and therapeutic targets. Recently, (R)-11C-Me-NB1 was investigated preclinically and shown to be a promising radioligand for imaging GluN2B subunits. Here, we report on the performance characteristics of this radioligand in a first-in-humans PET study.Methods:Six healthy male subjects were scanned twice on a fully integrated PET/MR scanner with (R)-11C-Me-NB1 for 120 min. Brain uptake and tracer distribution over time were investigated by SUVs. Test-retest reliability was assessed with the absolute percentage difference and the coefficient of variation. Exploratory total volumes of distribution (VT) were computed using an arterial input function and the Logan plot as well as a constrained 2-tissue-compartment model with the ratio of rate constants between plasma and tissue compartments (K1/k2) coupled (2TCM). SUV was correlated with VTto investigate its potential as a surrogate marker of GluN2B expression.Results:High and heterogeneous radioligand uptake was observed across the entire gray matter with reversible kinetics within the scan time. SUV absolute percentage difference ranged from 6.9% to 8.5% and coefficient of variation from 4.9% to 6.0%, indicating a high test-retest reliability. A moderate correlation was found between SUV averaged from 70 to 90 min and VTusing Logan plot (Spearman ρ = 0.44). Correlation between VTLogan and 2TCM wasr= 0.76.Conclusion:The radioligand (R)-11C-Me-NB1 was highly effective in mapping GluN2B-enriched NMDARs in the human brain. With a heterogeneous uptake and a high test-retest reliability, this radioligand offers promise to deepen our understanding of the GluN2B-containing NMDAR in the pathophysiology and treatment of neuropsychiatric disease such as Alzheimer disease and major depression. Additionally, it could help in the selection of appropriate doses of GluN2B-targeting drugs.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34620732/
Comparison of (+)-(11)C-McN5652 and (11)C-DASB as serotonin transporter radioligands under various experimental conditions,"Zsolt Szabo, Una D McCann, Alan A Wilson, Ursula Scheffel, Taofeek Owonikoko, William B Mathews, Hayden T Ravert, John Hilton, Robert F Dannals, George A Ricaurte","There has been considerable interest in the development of a PET radioligand selective for the serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]) transporter (SERT) that can be used to image 5-HT neurons in the living human brain. The most widely used SERT radiotracer to date, trans-1,2,3,5,6,10-beta-hexahydro-6-[4-(methylthio)phenyl[pyrrolo-[2,1-a]isoquinoline ((+)-(11)C-McN5652), has been successful in this regard but may have some limitations. Recently, another promising SERT radiotracer, 3-(11)C-amino-4-(2-dimethylaminomethylphenylsulfanyl)benzonitrile ((11)C-DASB), has been described. The purpose of this study was to compare and contrast (+)-(11)C-McN5652 and (11)C-DASB under various experimental conditions.

Methods: Radioligand comparisons were performed in a control baboon, a baboon with reduced SERT density ((+/-)-3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine [MDMA] lesion), and a baboon with reduced SERT availability (paroxetine pretreatment). Under each of these experimental conditions, repeated (triplicate) PET studies were performed with each ligand.

Results: Both radiotracers bound preferentially in brain regions known to contain high SERT density. For both ligands, there was a high correlation between the amount of regional brain ligand binding and the known regional brain concentration of SERT. Binding of both ligands was decreased after MDMA neurotoxicity (reduced SERT density), and (+)-(11)C-McN5652 and (11)C-DASB were comparably effective in detecting reduced SERT density after MDMA-induced 5-HT neurotoxicity. Pretreatment with paroxetine dramatically altered the metabolism and kinetics of both tracers and appeared to displace both ligands primarily from regions with high SERT density. Compared with (+)-(11)C-McN5652, (11)C-DASB had higher brain activity and a faster washout rate and provided greater contrast between subcortical and cortical brain regions.

Conclusion: (11)C-DASB and (+)-(11)C-McN5652 are suitable as PET ligands of the SERT and for detecting MDMA-induced 5-HT neurotoxicity. (11)C-DASB may offer some advantages.

(64)Cu labeled AmBaSar-RGD2 for micro-PET imaging of integrin αvβ3 expression,"Hancheng Cai, Zibo Li, Chiun-Wei Huang, Ryan Park, Peter S Conti","Integrin αvβ3 plays a critical role in tumor-induced angiogenesis and metastasis. Previously, a 64Cu-AmBaSar- RGD monomer with high in vivo stability compared with 64Cu-DOTA-RGD was developed for integrin αvβ3 PET imaging. It has been established that dimeric RGD peptides have higher receptor-binding affinity and superior in vivo kinetics compared with monomeric RGD peptides due to the polyvalency effect. In this context, we synthesized and evaluated 64Cu-labeled AmBaSar dimeric RGD conjugates (64Cu-AmBaSar-RGD2) for PET imaging of integrin αvβ3 expression. The dimeric RGD peptide was conjugated with a cage-like chelator AmBaSar and labeled with 64Cu. Cell binding, microPET imaging, receptor blocking, and biodistribution studies of 64Cu-AmBaSar-RGD2 were conducted in the U87MG human glioblastoma xenograft model. AmBaSar-RGD2 conjugate was obtained in reasonable yield (45.0 ± 2.5%, n= 4) and the identity was confirmed by HPLC and MS (found 1779.8, calculated m/z for [M+H]+ M: C81H125N27O19 1779.9). 64Cu-AmBaSar-RGD2 was obtained with high radiochemical yield (92.0 ± 1.3%) and purity (≥ 98.0%) under mild conditions (pH 5.0~5.5, 23~37 °C) in 30 min. The specific activity of 64Cu-AmBaSar-RGD2 was estimated to be 15-22 GBq/µmol at the end of synthesis. Based on microPET imaging and biodistribution studies, 64Cu-AmBaSar-RGD2 has demonstrated higher tumor uptake at selected time points than 64Cu-AmBaSar-RGD. At 20 h p.i., the tumor uptake reached 0.65 ± 0.05 %ID/g for 64Cu-AmBaSar-RGD and 1.76 ± 0.38 %ID/g for 64Cu-AmBaSar-RGD2, respectively. The integrin αvβ3 targeting specificity was confirmed by blocking experiments. Therefore, the new tracer 64Cu-AmBaSar- RGD2 exhibited better tumor-targeting efficacy and more favorable in vivo pharmacokinetics than the 64Cu labeled RGD monomer due to the polyvalency effect.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22191616/
Factors affecting myocardial 2-[F-18]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose uptake in positron emission tomography studies of normal humans,"Y Choi, R C Brunken, R A Hawkins, S C Huang, D B Buxton, C K Hoh, M E Phelps, H R Schelbert","The goal of this study was to identify the anatomic and physiologic factors affecting left ventricular myocardial 2-[F-18]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) uptake and myocardial glucose utilization rates (MRGlc) in normal humans. Eighteen healthy male volunteers were studied in the fasting state (4-19 h) and 16 after oral glucose loading (100 g dextrose) with positron emission tomography (PET) and FDG. Substrate and hormone concentrations were measured in each study. The kinetics of myocardial FDG uptake were evaluated using both a three-compartment model and Patlak graphical analysis. Systolic blood pressures and rate pressure products were similar in the fasting and postglucose states. MRGlc averaged 0.24 +/- 0.17 mumol/min/g in fasting subjects and rose to 0.69 +/- 0.11 mumol/min/g after glucose loading. Phosphorylation rate constant, k3, and MRGlc were linearly related (P < 0.001). Increases in MRGlc following glucose loading were correlated with plasma glucose, insulin and free fatty acid concentrations, ratios of insulin to glucagon levels, and influx rate constants of FDG. Glucose loading improved the diagnostic image quality due to more rapid clearance of tracer from blood and higher myocardial FDG uptake. When MRGlc, glucose and insulin concentrations, and insulin to glucagon ratios exceeded 0.2 mumol/min/g, 100 mg/dl, 19 microU/ml, and 0.2 microU/pg, respectively, myocardial uptake of FDG was always adequate for diagnostic use. FDG image quality and MRGlc were similar after relatively short (6 +/- 2 h) and overnight (16 +/- 2 h) fasting. Significant (P < 0.05) regional heterogeneity of myocardial FDG uptake and MRGlc was observed in both the fasting and the postglucose studies. MRGlc and FDG uptake values in the posterolateral wall were higher than those in the anterior wall and septum. Thus, both 6-h and overnight fasts resulted in similarly low myocardial glucose utilization rates. While MRGlc and myocardial FDG uptake depended on plasma glucose, free fatty acid, and insulin concentrations, the results also suggest an additional dependency on plasma glucagon levels. Regional heterogeneities in myocardial FDG uptake and MRGlc are evident and independent of the subjects' dietary state. These regional heterogeneities need to be considered in studies of patients with cardiac disease.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8491223/
Evaluation of 68Ga-DOTA-Ubiquicidin (29-41) for imaging Staphylococcus aureus (Staph A) infection and turpentine-induced inflammation in a preclinical setting,"Dilip Kumar Boddeti, Vijay Kumar","Synthetic antimicrobial peptide fragment,99mTc-Ubiquicidin 29-41, is shown to be sensitive and also specific for imaging bacterial infections. We undertook this study to explore the advantage of using a positron emission agent,68Ga-DOTA-Ubiquicidin 29-41 (68Ga-DOTA-UBI), for detecting Staph-A infection in an animal model, and also evaluated its ability to distinguish a turpentine-induced sterile inflammation in an animal model. Pure Ga-68 was freshly eluted from a68Ge/68Ga generator (IGG-100). DOTA-UBI (50 μg) was ra diolabeled with pure Ga-68 (500MBq) by incubating the reaction mixture at pH 4.5 for 10 min, 95°C. Rats were infected with Staph-A at the hind leg joint of rats to form bacterial abscess. Sterile inflammation was induced in the right thigh muscle by injecting 200 μl of 100% turpentine oil. Rats were injected intravenously with 10-15 MBq of tracer, and images were acquired at different time intervals with Siemens (Biograph mCT) positron emission tomography computed tomography scanner. The early images at 6 min postinjection clearly indicated mild uptake of the agent corresponding to the infection site, which increased dramatically at 20, 30, and 60 min postinjection. The target to background ratio (T/B) increased significantly over the same time period of study (1.6, 4.2, and 6.1, respectively). There was a mild uptake of68Ga-DOTA-UBI at the site corresponding to sterile inflammation at 6 min postinjection, which was rapidly washed off as seen at 25 and 45 min images. The images indicated fast clearance of the agent from liver and soft tissues within 6 min. Control rats showed similar biodistribution of activity. The mild uptake of68Ga-DOTA-UBI at the corresponding Staph-A infection lesion and very fast kinetics of clearance from the blood pool and soft tissues suggested a very high clinical potential for this agent. The absence of uptake of the agent at sterile inflammation site suggests that the agent may be useful in distinguishing infection from inflammation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34703395/
Inflammatory projections after focal brain injury trigger neuronal network disruption: An 18F-DPA714 PET study in mice,"Sanae Hosomi, Tadashi Watabe, Yuki Mori, Yoshihisa Koyama, Soichiro Adachi, Namiko Hoshi, Mitsuo Ohnishi, Hiroshi Ogura, Yoshichika Yoshioka, Jun Hatazawa, Toshihide Yamashita, Takeshi Shimazu","Due to the heterogeneous pathology of traumatic brain injury (TBI), the exact mechanism of how initial brain damage leads to chronic inflammation and its effects on the whole brain remain unclear. Here, we report on long-term neuroinflammation, remote from the initial injury site, even after subsiding of the original inflammatory response, in a focal TBI mouse model. The use of translocator protein-positron emission tomography in conjunction with specialised magnetic resonance imaging modalities enabled us to visualize ""previously undetected areas"" of spreading inflammation after focal cortical injury. These clinically available modalities further revealed the pathophysiology of thalamic neuronal degeneration occurring as resident microglia sense damage to corticothalamic neuronal tracts and become activated. The resulting microglial activation plays a major role in prolonged inflammatory processes, which are deleterious to the thalamic network. In light of the association of this mechanism with neuronal tracts, we propose it can be termed ""brain injury related inflammatory projection"". Our findings on multiple spatial and temporal scales provide insight into the chronic inflammation present in neurodegenerative diseases after TBI.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30312938/
Evaluation of hepatic integrin αvβ3 expression in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) model mouse by 18F-FPP-RGD2 PET,"Takemi Rokugawa, Haruyo Konishi, Miwa Ito, Hitoshi Iimori, Ryohei Nagai, Eku Shimosegawa, Jun Hatazawa, Kohji Abe","Background: Activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), which express integrin αvβ3, are a major fibrogenic factor in NASH pathophysiology.18F-labeled cyclic arginine-glycine-aspartic acid penta-peptide (18F-FPP-RGD2) has been used as a PET probe for tumors expressing integrin αvβ3. The aim of this study was to assess the potential of PET with18F-FPP-RGD2to detect hepatic integrin αvβ3 expression in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) model mice.

Results: Thirty-two male C57BL/6 mice aged 6 weeks were fed a choline-deficient, L-amino acid-defined, high-fat diet (CDAHFD) for 3 and 8 weeks.18F-FPP-RGD2PET imaging of the liver was performed at 3 and 8 weeks after CDAHFD feeding. After PET scanning, levels of hepatic integrin αvβ, 3α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), and collagen type 1 alpha 1(col1a1) were measured. Histopathological analysis of hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis, as well as blood biochemistry analysis, was also performed. CDAHFD for 3 and 8 weeks produced a moderate-to-severe steatosis and inflammation of the liver in mice. NAFLD activity score (NAS) in mice fed the CDAHFD for 3 and 8 weeks were more than 4 indicating NASH or borderline NASH pathology. Fibrosis was observed only in mice fed the CDAHFD for 8 weeks. PET imaging showed that the hepatic standardized uptake value, SUV80-90 min, was increased with prolonged CDAHFD feeding compared with the respective controls (CDAHFD 3 weeks 0.32 ± 0.06 vs 0.48 ± 0.05, p < 0.01; CDAHFD 8 weeks 0.35 ± 0.04 vs 0.75 ± 0.07, p < 0.01, respectively). Prolonged CDAHFD feeding increased hepatic mRNA and protein levels of integrin αv and β3 at 3 and 8 weeks. Hepatic18F-FPP-RGD2uptake and amount of integrin αv and β3 protein were well correlated (r = 0.593, p < 0.05 and r = 0.835, p < 0.001, respectively). Hepatic18F-FPP-RGD2uptake also showed a positive correlation with Sirius red-positive area.

Conclusions: The hepatic uptake of18F-FPP-RGD2correlated well with integrin αv and β3 expression and histological fibrosis in a mouse model of NASH, suggesting the predictability of fibrosis in NASH pathology.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29855729/
MHC-mismatched Allotransplantation of Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-derived Cardiomyocyte Sheets to Improve Cardiac Function in a Primate Ischemic Cardiomyopathy Model,"Noriyuki Kashiyama, Shigeru Miyagawa, Satsuki Fukushima, Takuji Kawamura, Ai Kawamura, Shohei Yoshida, Seiko Eiraku, Akima Harada, Keiko Matsunaga, Tadashi Watabe, Koichi Toda, Jun Hatazawa, Yoshiki Sawa","Background: Although allogeneic-induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes (CMs) exhibit potential in cardiomyogenesis for heart failure, whether major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-matched allogenic iPSC implantation (MMAI) minimizes immune rejection for cell survival or functional recovery remains unknown. We herein explored whether MMAI with an iPSC-CM sheet is stable for a longer period and therapeutically more effective than MHC-mismatched AI in a primate ischemic cardiomyopathy model.

Methods: Green fluorescent protein-transfected iPSC-CM sheets, derived from cynomolgus macaques with homozygous MHC haplotypes ''HT1,'' were transplanted on the left ventricle, generated by ligating the left anterior descending artery for 2 weeks in an ischemic model with or without heterozygous HT1 as MMAI and MHC-mismatched AI. Sham models were made by opening the chest at 14 days after left anterior descending ligation without any treatment.

Results: Stereomicroscopy revealed that at 4 months after transplantation, green fluorescent protein intensity was higher in the MMAI group than in the MHC-mismatched AI group and the sham group. Immunohistochemistry staining revealed that host immune reaction with CD3-positive cells was stronger in MHC-mismatched AI than in MMAI at 3 months. Cardiac function improved both in MMAI and MHC-mismatched AI at 1 month after transplantation and was preserved until 6 months, whereas in the sham group, functional deterioration progressed over time.

Conclusions: Although MHC-homo-iPSCs are preferred to avoid immune rejection, MHC-mismatched iPSC-CMs can also induce comparable cardiac functional recovery at late follow-up, suggesting that MHC-mismatched iPSC-based cardiac regenerative therapy with immunosuppressants is a feasible option for treating heart failure in clinical settings.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31107828/
Development of PET Imaging to Visualize Activated Macrophages Accumulated in the Transplanted iPSc-Derived Cardiac Myocytes of Allogeneic Origin for Detecting the Immune Rejection of Allogeneic Cell Transplants in Mice,"Noriyuki Kashiyama, Shigeru Miyagawa, Satsuki Fukushima, Takuji Kawamura, Ai Kawamura, Shohei Yoshida, Akima Harada, Tadashi Watabe, Yasukazu Kanai, Koichi Toda, Jun Hatazawa, Yoshiki Sawa","Allogeneic transplantation (Tx) of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) is a promising tissue regeneration therapy. However, this inevitably induces macrophage-mediated immune response against the graft, limiting its therapeutic efficacy. Monitoring the magnitude of the immune response using imaging tools would be useful for prolonging graft survival and increasing the therapy longevity. Minimally invasive quantitative detection of activated macrophages by medical imaging technologies such as positron emission tomography (PET) imaging targets translocator protein (TSPO), which is highly expressed on mitochondrial membrane, especially in activated macrophage. N,N-diethyl-2-[4-(2-fluoroethoxy) phenyl]-5,7-dimethylpyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine-3-acetamide (DPA-714) is known as a TSPO ligand used in clinical settings. We herein hypothesized that immune rejection of the transplanted iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) of allogeneic origin may be quantitated using 18F-DPA-714-PET imaging study. iPSC-CM cell-sheets of C57BL/6 mice origin were transplanted on the surface of the left ventricle (LV) of C57BL/6 mice as a syngeneic cell-transplant model (syngeneic Tx group), or Balb/c mice as an allogeneic model (allogeneic Tx group). 18F-DPA-714-PET was used to determine the uptake ratio, calculated as the maximum standardized uptake value in the anterior and septal wall of the LV. The uptake ratio was significantly higher in the allogeneic Tx group than in the syngeneic group or the sham group at days 7 and day 10 after the cell transplantation. In addition, the immunochemistry showed significant presence of CD68 and CD3-positive cells at day 7 and 10 in the transplanted graft of the allogeneic Tx group. The expression of TSPO, CD68, IL-1 beta, and MCP-1 was significantly higher in the allogeneic Tx group than in the syngeneic Tx and the sham groups at day 7. The 18F-DPA-714-PET imaging study enabled quantitative visualization of the macrophages-mediated immune rejection of the allogeneic iPSC-cardiac.

Improvement of algorithm for quantification of regional myocardial blood flow using 15O-water with PET,"Chietsugu Katoh, Koichi Morita, Tohru Shiga, Naoki Kubo, Kunihiro Nakada, Nagara Tamaki","(15)O-Water and dynamic PET allow noninvasive quantification of myocardial blood flow (MBF). However, complicated image analyzing procedures are required, which may limit the practicality of this approach. We have designed a new practical algorithm, which allows stable, rapid, and automated quantification of regional MBF (rMBF) using (15)O-water PET. We designed an algorithm for setting the 3-dimensional (3D) region of interest (ROI) of the whole myocardium semiautomatically. Subsequently, a uniform input function was calculated for each subject using a time-activity curve in the 3D whole myocardial ROI. The uniform input function allows the mathematically simple and robust algorithm to estimate rMBF.

Methods: Thirty-six volunteers were used in the static (15)O-CO and dynamic (15)O-water PET studies. To evaluate the reproducibility of the estimates, a repeated (15)O-water scan was obtained under resting condition. In addition, to evaluate the stability of the new algorithm in the hyperemic state, a (15)O-water scan was obtained with adenosine triphosphate. This algorithm includes a procedure for positioning a 3D ROI of the whole myocardium from 3D images and dividing it into 16 segments. Subsequently, the uniform input function was calculated using time-activity curves in the whole myocardial ROI and in the LV ROI. The uniform input function allowed this simple and robust algorithm to estimate the rMBF, perfusable tissue fraction (PTF), and spillover fraction (Va) according to a single tissue compartment model. These estimates were compared with those calculated using the original method. A simulation study was performed to compare the effects of errors in PTF or Va on the MBF using the 2 methods.

Results: The average operating time for positioning a whole myocardial ROI and 16 regional myocardial ROIs was <5 min. The new method yielded less deviation in rMBF (0.876 +/- 0.177 mL/min/g, coefficient of variation [CV] = 20.2%, n = 576) than those with the traditional method (0.898 +/- 0.271 mL/min/g, CV = 30.1%, n = 576) (P < 0.01). In the hyperemic state, the new method yielded less deviation in rMBF (3.890 +/- 1.250 mL/min/g, CV = 32.1%) than those with the traditional method (3.962 +/- 1.762 mL/min/g, CV = 44.4%) (P < 0.05). This method yielded significantly higher reproducibility of rMBF (r = 0.806, n = 576) than the original method (r = 0.756, n = 576) (P < 0.05). Our new method yielded a better correlation in the repeated measurement values of rMBF and less variability among the regions in the myocardium than with the original theory of the (15)O-water technique. The simulation study demonstrated fewer effects of error in the PTF or Va on the MBF value with the new method.

Conclusion: We have developed a technique for an automated, simplified, and stable algorithm to quantify rMBF. This software is considered to be practical for clinical use in myocardial PET studies using (15)O-water with a high reproducibility and a short processing time.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15534062/

Twelve patients with NSCLC were enrolled. Six patients underwent chemotherapy with bevacizumab and the other six without bevacizumab.15O-water dynamic PET scans were performed within 1 week before the start of chemotherapy and within 1 week after the first day of chemotherapy. Tumor blood flow was analyzed quantitatively using a single one-tissue compartment model with the correction of pulmonary circulation blood volume and arterial blood volume via an image-derived input function.

The diagnostic value of (18)F-FPRGD2 was evaluated in subcutaneous U87MG glioblastoma xenografted mice and in c-neu transgenic mice by quantitative microPET imaging studies.

Results: The decay-corrected radiochemical yield based on (18)F-SFB was more than 60% with radiochemical purity of >99%. (18)F-FPRGD2 had high receptor binding affinity, metabolic stability, and integrin alpha(v)beta(3)-specific tumor uptake in the U87MG glioma xenograft model comparable to those of (18)F-FRGD2. The kidney uptake was appreciably lower for (18)F-FPRGD2 compared with (18)F-FRGD2 [2.0 +/- 0.2%ID/g for (18)F-FPRGD2 vs 3.0 +/- 0.2%ID/g for (18)F-FRGD2 at 1 h post injection (p.i.)]. The uptake in all the other organs except the urinary bladder was at background level. (18)F-FPRGD2 also exhibited excellent tumor uptake in c-neu oncomice (3.6 +/- 0.1%ID/g at 30 min p.i.).

Conclusion: Incorporation of a mini-PEG spacer significantly improved the overall radiolabeling yield of (18)F-FPRGD2. (18)F-FPRGD2 also had reduced renal uptake and similar tumor targeting efficacy as compared with (18)F-FRGD2. Further testing and clinical translation of (18)F-FPRGD2 are warranted.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17492285/
Dynamic 2D and 3D mapping of hyperpolarized pyruvate to lactate conversion in vivo with efficient multi-echo balanced steady-state free precession at 3 T,"Christoph A Müller, Christian Hundshammer, Miriam Braeuer, Jason G Skinner, Stephan Berner, Jochen Leupold, Stephan Düwel, Stephan G Nekolla, Sven Månsson, Adam E Hansen, Dominik von Elverfeldt, Jan H Ardenkjaer-Larsen, Franz Schilling, Markus Schwaiger, Jürgen Hennig, Jan-Bernd Hövener","The aim of this study was to acquire the transient MRI signal of hyperpolarized tracers and their metabolites efficiently, for which specialized imaging sequences are required. In this work, a multi-echo balanced steady-state free precession (me-bSSFP) sequence with Iterative Decomposition with Echo Asymmetry and Least squares estimation (IDEAL) reconstruction was implemented on a clinical 3 T positron-emission tomography/MRI system for fast 2D and 3D metabolic imaging. Simulations were conducted to obtain signal-efficient sequence protocols for the metabolic imaging of hyperpolarized biomolecules. The sequence was applied in vitro and in vivo for probing the enzymatic exchange of hyperpolarized [1-13C]pyruvate and [1-13C]lactate. Chemical shift resolution was achieved using a least-square, iterative chemical species separation algorithm in the reconstruction. In vitro, metabolic conversion rate measurements from me-bSSFP were compared with NMR spectroscopy and free induction decay-chemical shift imaging (FID-CSI). In vivo, a rat MAT-B-III tumor model was imaged with me-bSSFP and FID-CSI. 2D metabolite maps of [1-13C]pyruvate and [1-13C]lactate acquired with me-bSSFP showed the same spatial distributions as FID-CSI. The pyruvate-lactate conversion kinetics measured with me-bSSFP and NMR corresponded well. Dynamic 2D metabolite mapping with me-bSSFP enabled the acquisition of up to 420 time frames (scan time: 180-350 ms/frame) before the hyperpolarized [1-13C]pyruvate was relaxed below noise level. 3D metabolite mapping with a large field of view (180 × 180 × 48 mm3) and high spatial resolution (5.6 × 5.6 × 2 mm3) was conducted with me-bSSFP in a scan time of 8.2 seconds. It was concluded that Me-bSSFP improves the spatial and temporal resolution for metabolic imaging of hyperpolarized [1-13C]pyruvate and [1-13C]lactate compared with either of the FID-CSI or EPSI methods reported at 3 T, providing new possibilities for clinical and preclinical applications.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32154970/
Cell-sheet therapy with omentopexy promotes arteriogenesis and improves coronary circulation physiology in failing heart,"Satoshi Kainuma, Shigeru Miyagawa, Satsuki Fukushima, James Pearson, Yi Ching Chen, Atsuhiro Saito, Akima Harada, Motoko Shiozaki, Hiroko Iseoka, Tadashi Watabe, Hiroshi Watabe, Genki Horitsugi, Mana Ishibashi, Hayato Ikeda, Hirotsugu Tsuchimochi, Takashi Sonobe, Yutaka Fujii, Hisamichi Naito, Keiji Umetani, Tatsuya Shimizu, Teruo Okano, Eiji Kobayashi, Takashi Daimon, Takayoshi Ueno, Toru Kuratani, Koichi Toda, Nobuyuki Takakura, Jun Hatazawa, Mikiyasu Shirai, Yoshiki Sawa","Cell-sheet transplantation induces angiogenesis for chronic myocardial infarction (MI), though insufﬁcient capillary maturation and paucity of arteriogenesis may limit its therapeutic effects. Omentum has been used clinically to promote revascularization and healing of ischemic tissues. We hypothesized that cell-sheet transplantation covered with an omentum-flap would effectively establish mature blood vessels and improve coronary microcirculation physiology, enhancing the therapeutic effects of cell-sheet therapy. Rats were divided into four groups after coronary ligation; skeletal myoblast cell-sheet plus omentum-flap (combined), cell-sheet only, omentum-flap only, and sham operation. At 4 weeks after the treatment, the combined group showed attenuated cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis, and a greater amount of functionally (CD31(+)/lectin(+)) and structurally (CD31(+)/α-SMA(+)) mature blood vessels, along with myocardial upregulation of relevant genes. Synchrotron-based microangiography revealed that the combined procedure increased vascularization in resistance arterial vessels with better dilatory responses to endothelium-dependent agents. Serial (13)N-ammonia PET showed better global coronary flow reserve in the combined group, mainly attributed to improvement in the basal left ventricle. Consequently, the combined group had sustained improvements in cardiac function parameters and better functional capacity. Cell-sheet transplantation with an omentum-flap better promoted arteriogenesis and improved coronary microcirculation physiology in ischemic myocardium, leading to potent functional recovery in the failing heart.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25421595/
Labeling of Anti-HER2 Nanobodies with Astatine-211: Optimization and the Effect of Different Coupling Reagents on Their in Vivo Behavior,"Yana Dekempeneer, Tom Bäck, Emma Aneheim, Holger Jensen, Janik Puttemans, Catarina Xavier, Marleen Keyaerts, Stig Palm, Per Albertsson, Tony Lahoutte, Vicky Caveliers, Sture Lindegren, Matthias D'Huyvetter","The use of nanobodies (Nbs) as vehicles in targeted alpha therapy (TAT) has gained great interest because of their excellent properties. They combine high in vivo affinity and specificity of binding with fast kinetics. This research investigates a novel targeted therapy that combines the α-particle emitter astatine-211 (211At) and the anti-HER2 Nb 2Rs15d to selectively target HER2+ cancer cells. Two distinctive radiochemical methodologies are investigated using three different coupling reagents. The first method uses the coupling reagents,N-succinimidyl 4-(1,2-bis-tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidinomethyl-3-(trimethylstannyl)benzoate (Boc2-SGMTB) andN-succinimidyl-3-(trimethylstannyl)benzoate (m-MeATE), which are both directed to amino groups on the Nb, resulting in random conjugation. The second method aims at obtaining a homogeneous tracer population, via a site-specific conjugation of theN-[2-(maleimido)ethyl]-3-(trimethylstannyl)benzamide (MSB) reagent onto the carboxyl-terminal cysteine of the Nb. The resulting radioconjugates are evaluated in vitro and in vivo. 2Rs15d is labeled with211At using Boc2-SGMTB,m-MeATE, and MSB. After astatination and purification, the binding specificity of the radioconjugates is validated on HER2+ cells, followed by an in vivo biodistribution assessment in SKOV-3 xenografted mice. α-camera imaging is performed to determine uptake and activity distribution in kidneys/tumors. 2Rs15d astatination resulted in a high radiochemical purity >95% for all radioconjugates. The biodistribution studies of all radioconjugates revealed comparable tumor uptake (higher than 8% ID/g at 1 h). [211At]SAGMB-2Rs15d showed minor uptake in normal tissues. Only in the kidneys, a higher uptake was measured after 1 h, but decreased rapidly after 3 h. Astatinated Nbs consisting ofm-MeATE or MSB reagents revealed elevated uptake in lungs and stomach, indicating the presence of released211At. α-Camera imaging of tumors revealed a homogeneous activity distribution. The radioactivity in the kidneys was initially concentrated in the renal cortex, while after 3 h most radioactivity was measured in the medulla, confirming the fast washout into urine. Changing the reagents for Nb astatination resulted in different in vivo biodistribution profiles, while keeping the targeting moiety identical. Boc2-SGMTB is the preferred reagent for Nb astatination because of its high tumor uptake, its low background signals, and its fast renal excretion. We envision [211At]SAGMB-2Rs15d to be a promising therapeutic agent for TAT and aim toward efficacy evaluation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31268724/
