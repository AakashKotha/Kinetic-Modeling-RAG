TITLE: Total-Body PET Kinetic Modeling and Potential Opportunities Using Deep Learning

AUTHORS: Yiran Wang, Elizabeth Li, Simon R Cherry, Guobao Wang

JOURNAL: PET clinics

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
The uEXPLORER total-body PET/CT system provides a very high level of detection sensitivity and simultaneous coverage of the entire body for dynamic imaging for quantification of tracer kinetics. This article describes the fundamentals and potential benefits of total-body kinetic modeling and parametric imaging focusing on the noninvasive derivation of blood input function, multiparametric imaging, and high-temporal resolution kinetic modeling. Along with its attractive properties, total-body kinetic modeling also brings significant challenges, such as the large scale of total-body dynamic PET data, the need for organ and tissue appropriate input functions and kinetic models, and total-body motion correction. These challenges, and the opportunities using deep learning, are discussed.

TITLE: Kinetic modeling and parameter estimation of TSPO PET imaging in the human brain

AUTHORS: Catriona Wimberley, Sonia Lavisse, Ansel Hillmer, Rainer Hinz, Federico Turkheimer, Paolo Zanotti-Fregonara

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Translocator protein 18-kDa (TSPO) imaging with positron emission tomography (PET) is widely used in research studies of brain diseases that have a neuro-immune component. Quantification of TSPO PET images, however, is associated with several challenges, such as the lack of a reference region, a genetic polymorphism affecting the affinity of the ligand for TSPO, and a strong TSPO signal in the endothelium of the brain vessels. These challenges have created an ongoing debate in the field about which type of quantification is most useful and whether there is an appropriate simplified model.

Methods: This review focuses on the quantification of TSPO radioligands in the human brain. The various methods of quantification are summarized, including the gold standard of compartmental modeling with metabolite-corrected input function as well as various alternative models and non-invasive approaches. Their advantages and drawbacks are critically assessed.

Results and conclusions: Researchers employing quantification methods for TSPO should understand the advantages and limitations associated with each method. Suggestions are given to help researchers choose between these viable alternative methods.

TITLE: Kinetic modeling and parametric imaging with dynamic PET for oncological applications: general considerations, current clinical applications, and future perspectives

AUTHORS: Antonia Dimitrakopoulou-Strauss, Leyun Pan, Christos Sachpekidis

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Dynamic PET (dPET) studies have been used until now primarily within research purposes. Although it is generally accepted that the information provided by dPET is superior to that of conventional static PET acquisitions acquired usually 60 min post injection of the radiotracer, the duration of dynamic protocols, the limited axial field of view (FOV) of current generation clinical PET systems covering a relatively small axial extent of the human body for a dynamic measurement, and the complexity of data evaluation have hampered its implementation into clinical routine. However, the development of new-generation PET/CT scanners with an extended FOV as well as of more sophisticated evaluation software packages that offer better segmentation algorithms, automatic retrieval of the arterial input function, and automatic calculation of parametric imaging, in combination with dedicated shorter dynamic protocols, will facilitate the wider use of dPET. This is expected to aid in oncological diagnostics and therapy assessment. The aim of this review is to present some general considerations about dPET analysis in oncology by means of kinetic modeling, based on compartmental and noncompartmental approaches, and parametric imaging. Moreover, the current clinical applications and future perspectives of the modality are outlined.

TITLE: Metabolic kinetic modeling of [11C]methionine based on total-body PET in multiple myeloma

AUTHORS: Jiajin Li, Beiwen Ni, Xiaofeng Yu, Cheng Wang, Lianghua Li, Yun Zhou, Yue Gu, Gang Huang, Jian Hou, Jianjun Liu, Yumei Chen

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Multiple myeloma (MM) is a malignant disease characterized by the secretion of monoclonal immunoglobulins and has a high demand for amino acids. [11C]methionine total-body PET is capable of noninvasive dynamic monitoring of radiotracer in vivo, thus providing a way to reveal the dynamic changes of myeloma metabolism. This study aims to analyze the metabolic process of [11C]methionine based on kinetic modeling, and to preliminary reveal its application value in MM.

Methods: Dynamic total-body [11C]methionine PET/CT was conducted with uEXPLORER in 12 subjects (9 MM patients and 3 controls). The tissue time activity curves (TACs) of organs and bone marrows were extracted. Model fitting of TACs was operated using PMOD Kinetic Modeling. After validation by Goodness of fit (GOF), the reversible two-tissue compartment model (2T4k) was used to further analysis. R software was used to analyze the correlation between kinetic parameters and clinical indicators.

Results: The 2T4k has passed the criterion of GOF and was used to fit the data of 0-20 minutes. The [11C]methionine net uptake rate (Ki) was significantly higher in the MM lesions than in the non-myeloma controls (control: 0.040±0.007 mL/g/min, MM: 0.171±0.108 mL/g/min, p=0.009). The Ki values were found to be correlated with M protein levels in MM patients. MM patients with t(4;14) translocations had an elevated k4 value compared with t(4;14) negative patients.

Conclusion: MM lesions have a propensity for uptake of [11C]methionine. The serum levels of M protein are correlated with [11C]methionine uptake rate in myeloma. Metabolic classification based on the k4 value may be a promising strategy for risk stratification in MM.

TITLE: High-Temporal-Resolution Lung Kinetic Modeling Using Total-Body Dynamic PET with Time-Delay and Dispersion Corrections

AUTHORS: Yiran Wang, Benjamin A Spencer, Jeffrey Schmall, Elizabeth Li, Ramsey D Badawi, Terry Jones, Simon R Cherry, Guobao Wang

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Tracer kinetic modeling in dynamic PET has the potential to improve the diagnosis, prognosis, and research of lung diseases. The advent of total-body PET systems with much greater detection sensitivity enables high-temporal-resolution (HTR) dynamic PET imaging of the lungs. However, existing models may become insufficient for modeling the HTR data. In this paper, we investigate the necessity of additional corrections to the input function for HTR lung kinetic modeling.Methods:Dynamic scans with HTR frames of as short as 1 s were performed on 13 healthy subjects with a bolus injection of about [Formula: see text] of18F-FDG using the uEXPLORER total-body PET/CT system. Three kinetic models with and without time-delay and dispersion corrections were compared for the quality of lung time-activity curve fitting using the Akaike information criterion. The impact on quantification of18F-FDG delivery rate [Formula: see text], net influx rate [Formula: see text] and fractional blood volume [Formula: see text] was assessed. Parameter identifiability analysis was also performed to evaluate the reliability of kinetic quantification with respect to noise. Correlation of kinetic parameters with age was investigated.Results:HTR dynamic imaging clearly revealed the rapid change in tracer concentration in the lungs and blood supply (i.e., the right ventricle). The uncorrected input function led to poor time-activity curve fitting and biased quantification in HTR kinetic modeling. The fitting was improved by time-delay and dispersion corrections. The proposed model resulted in an approximately 85% decrease in [Formula: see text], an approximately 75% increase in [Formula: see text], and a more reasonable [Formula: see text] (∼0.14) than the uncorrected model (∼0.04). The identifiability analysis showed that the proposed models had good quantification stability for [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], and [Formula: see text] The [Formula: see text] estimated by the proposed model with simultaneous time-delay and dispersion corrections correlated inversely with age, as would be expected.Conclusion:Corrections to the input function are important for accurate lung kinetic analysis of HTR dynamic PET data. The modeling of both delay and dispersion can improve model fitting and significantly impact quantification of [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], and [Formula: see text].

TITLE: Efficient Delay Correction for Total-Body PET Kinetic Modeling Using Pulse Timing Methods

AUTHORS: Elizabeth J Li, Benjamin A Spencer, Jeffrey P Schmall, Yasser Abdelhafez, Ramsey D Badawi, Guobao Wang, Simon R Cherry

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Quantitative kinetic modeling requires an input function. A noninvasive image-derived input function (IDIF) can be obtained from dynamic PET images. However, a robust IDIF location (e.g., aorta) may be far from a tissue of interest, particularly in total-body PET, introducing a time delay between the IDIF and the tissue. The standard practice of joint estimation (JE) of delay, along with model fitting, is computationally expensive. To improve the efficiency of delay correction for total-body PET parametric imaging, this study investigated the use of pulse timing methods to estimate and correct for delay.Methods:Simulation studies were performed with a range of delay values, frame lengths, and noise levels to test the tolerance of 2 pulse timing methods-leading edge (LE) and constant fraction discrimination and their thresholds. The methods were then applied to data from 21 subjects (14 healthy volunteers, 7 cancer patients) who underwent a 60-min dynamic total-body18F-FDG PET acquisition. Region-of-interest kinetic analysis was performed and parametric images were generated to compare LE and JE methods of delay correction, as well as no delay correction.Results:Simulations demonstrated that a 10% LE threshold resulted in biases and SDs at tolerable levels for all noise levels tested, with 2-s frames. Pooled region-of-interest-based results (n= 154) showed strong agreement between LE (10% threshold) and JE methods in estimating delay (Pearsonr =0.96,P <0.001) and the kinetic parameters(r =0.96,P <0.001),(r =1.00,P <0.001), andK1(r =0.97,P <0.001). When tissues with minimal delay were excluded from pooled analyses, there were reductions in(69.4%) andK1(4.8%) when delay correction was not performed. Similar results were obtained for parametric images; additionally, lesioncontrast was improved overall with LE and JE delay correction compared with no delay correction and Patlak analysis.Conclusion:This study demonstrated the importance of delay correction in total-body PET. LE delay correction can be an efficient surrogate for JE, requiring a fraction of the computational time and allowing for rapid delay correction across more than 106voxels in total-body PET datasets.

TITLE: Full kinetic modeling analysis of [18F]fluorocholine Positron Emission Tomography (PET) at initial diagnosis of high-grade glioma

AUTHORS: Sebastià Rubí, Pedro Bibiloni, Marina Villar, Marta Brell, Manuel Valiente, Margalida Galmés, María Toscano, Gabriel Matheu, José Luis Chinchilla, Jesús Molina, José Luis Valera, Ángel Ríos, Meritxell López, Cristina Peña

JOURNAL: NeuroImage. Clinical

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: The main objective was to characterize the tracer uptake kinetics of [18F]fluoromethylcholine ([18F]F-CHO) in high-grade gliomas (HGG) through a full PET kinetic modeling approach. Secondarily, we aimed to explore the relationship between the PET uptake measures and the HGG molecular features.

Materials and methods: Twenty-four patients with a suspected diagnosis of HGG were prospectively included. They underwent a dynamic brain [18F]F-CHO-PET/CT, from which a tumoral time-activity curve was extracted. The plasma input function was obtained through arterial blood sampling with metabolite correction. These data were fitted to 1- and 2-tissue-compartment models, the best of which was selected through the Akaike information criterion. We assessed the correlation between the kinetic parameters and the conventional static PET metrics (SUVmax, SUVmeanand tumor-to-background ratio TBR). We explored the association between the [18F]F-CHO-PET quantitative parameters and relevant molecular biomarkers in HGG.

Results: Tumoral time-activity curves in all patients showed a rapid rise of [18F]F-CHO uptake followed by a plateau-like shape. Best fits were obtained with near-irreversible 2-tissue-compartment models. The perfusion-transport constant K1and the net influx rate Kishowed strong correlation with SUVmax(r = 0.808-0.861), SUVmean(r = 0.794-0.851) and TBR (r = 0.643-0.784), p < 0.002. HGG was confirmed in 21 patients, of which those with methylation of the O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) gene promoter showed higher mean Ki(p = 0.020), K1(p = 0.025) and TBR (p = 0.001) than the unmethylated ones.

Conclusion: [18F]F-CHO uptake kinetics in HGG is best explained by a 2-tissue-compartment model. The conventional static [18F]F-CHO-PET measures have been validated against the perfusion-transport constant (K1) and the net influx rate (Ki) derived from kinetic modeling. A relationship between [18F]F-CHO uptake rate and MGMT methylation is suggested but needs further confirmation.

TITLE: Optimized Methodology for Reference Region and Image-Derived Input Function Kinetic Modeling in Preclinical PET

AUTHORS: Jason Bini, Christine R Lattin, Takuya Toyonaga, Sjoerd J Finnema, Richard Carson

JOURNAL: IEEE transactions on radiation and plasma medical sciences

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
PET imaging of small animals is often used for assessing biodistribution of a novel radioligand and pharmacology in small animal models of disease. PET acquisition and processing settings may affect reference region or image-derived input function (IDIF) kinetic modeling estimates. We examined four different factors in comparing quantitative results: 1) effect of reconstruction algorithm, 2) number of MAP iterations, 3) strength of the MAP prior, and 4) Attenuation and scatter. The effect of these parameters has not been explored for small-animal reference region and IDIF kinetic modeling approaches. Dynamic PET/CT scans were performed in 3 species with 3 different tracers: house sparrows with [11C]raclopride, rats with [18F]AS2471907 (11βHSD1) and mice with [11C]UCB-J (SV2A). FBP yielded lower kinetic modeling estimates compared to 3D-OSEM-MAP reconstructions, in sparrow and rat studies. Target resolutions (MAP prior strength) of 1.5 and 3.0mm demonstrated reducedin rats but only 3.0mm reduced BPNDin sparrows. Therefore, use of the highest target resolution (0.8mm) is warranted. We demonstrated using kinetic modeling that forgoing CT-based attenuation and scatter correction may be appropriate to improve animal throughput when using short-lived radioisotopes in sparrows and mice. This work provides recommendations and a framework for future optimization of kinetic modeling for preclinical PET methodology with novel radioligands.

TITLE: Spatially constrained kinetic modeling with dual reference tissues improves 18F-flortaucipir PET in studies of Alzheimer disease

AUTHORS: Yun Zhou, Shaney Flores, Syahir Mansor, Russ C Hornbeck, Zhude Tu, Joel S Perlmutter, Beau Ances, John C Morris, Robert J Gropler, Tammie L S Benzinger

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Recent studies have shown that standard compartmental models using plasma input or the cerebellum reference tissue input are generally not reliable for quantifying tau burden in dynamic18F-flortaucipir PET studies of Alzheimer disease. So far, the optimal reference region for estimating18F-flortaucipir delivery and specific tau binding has yet to be determined. The objective of the study is to improve18F-flortaucipir brain tau PET quantification using a spatially constrained kinetic model with dual reference tissues.

Methods: Participants were classified as either cognitively normal (CN) or cognitively impaired (CI) based on clinical assessment. T1-weighted structural MRI and 105-min dynamic18F-flortaucipir PET scans were acquired for each participant. Using both a simplified reference tissue model (SRTM2) and Logan plot with either cerebellum gray matter or centrum semiovale (CS) white matter as the reference tissue, we estimated distribution volume ratios (DVRs) and the relative transport rate constant R1for region of interest-based (ROI) and voxelwise-based analyses. Conventional linear regression (LR) and LR with spatially constrained (LRSC) parametric imaging algorithms were then evaluated. Noise-induced bias in the parametric images was compared to estimates from ROI time activity curve-based kinetic modeling. We finally evaluated standardized uptake value ratios at early phase (SUVREP, 0.7-2.9 min) and late phase (SUVRLP, 80-105 min) to approximate R1and DVR, respectively.

Results: The percent coefficients of variation of R1and DVR estimates from SRTM2 with spatially constrained modeling were comparable to those from the Logan plot and SUVRs. The SRTM2 using CS reference tissue with LRSC reduced noise-induced underestimation in the LR generated DVR images to negligible levels (< 1%). Inconsistent overestimation of DVR in the SUVRLPonly occurred using the cerebellum reference tissue-based measurements. The CS reference tissue-based DVR and SUVRLP, and cerebellum-based SUVREPand R1provided higher Cohen's effect size d to detect increased tau deposition and reduced relative tracer transport rate in CI individuals.

Conclusion: Using a spatially constrained kinetic model with dual reference tissues significantly improved quantification of relative perfusion and tau binding. Cerebellum and CS are the suggested reference tissues to estimate R1and DVR, respectively, for dynamic18F-flortaucipir PET studies. Cerebellum-based SUVREPand CS-based SUVRLPmay be used to simplify18F-flortaucipir PET study.

TITLE: A new framework for metabolic connectivity mapping using bolus [18F]FDG PET and kinetic modeling

ABSTRACT:
Metabolic connectivity (MC) has been previously proposed as the covariation of static [18F]FDG PET images across participants, i.e.,across-individualMC (ai-MC). In few cases, MC has been inferred from dynamic [18F]FDG signals, i.e.,within-individualMC (wi-MC), as for resting-state fMRI functional connectivity (FC). The validity and interpretability of both approaches is an important open issue. Here we reassess this topic, aiming to 1) develop a novel wi-MC methodology; 2) compare ai-MC maps from standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) vs. [18F]FDG kinetic parameters fully describing the tracer behavior (i.e.,Ki,K1,k3); 3) assess MC interpretability in comparison to structural connectivity and FC. We developed a new approach based on Euclidean distance to calculate wi-MC from PET time-activity curves. The across-individual correlation ofSUVR,Ki,K1,k3produced different networks depending on the chosen [18F]FDG parameter (k3MC vs.SUVRMC, r = 0.44). We found that wi-MC and ai-MC matrices are dissimilar (maximum r = 0.37), and that the match with FC is higher for wi-MC (Dice similarity: 0.47-0.63) than for ai-MC (0.24-0.39). Our analyses demonstrate that calculating individual-level MC from dynamic PET is feasible and yields interpretable matrices that bear similarity to fMRI FC measures.

ABSTRACT:
Fibroblast activation protein inhibitor (FAPI) is an ideal diagnostic and therapeutic target in malignant tumors. However, the knowledge of kinetic modeling and parametric imaging of68Ga-FAPI is limited.Purpose:The purpose of this study was to explore the pharmacokinetics of68Ga-FAPI-04 PET/CT in pancreatic cancer and gastric cancer and to conduct parametric imaging of dynamic total-body data compared with SUV imaging.Methods:Dynamic total-body68Ga-FAPI-04 PET/CT was performed on 13 patients. The lesion time-activity curves were fitted by 3-compartment models and multigraphical models. The kinetics parameters derived from the 2-tissue reversible compartment model (2T4K) and multigraphical models were analyzed. Parametric [Formula: see text] imaging was generated using the 2T4K and Logan models, and their performances were evaluated compared with SUV images.Results:2T4K had the lowest Akaike information criterion value, and its fitting curves matched excellently with the origin time-activity curves. Visual assessment revealed that the [Formula: see text](2T4K) images and [Formula: see text](Logan with spatial constraint [SC]) images both showed less image noise and higher lesion conspicuity compared with SUV images. Objective image quality assessment demonstrated that parametric [Formula: see text](2T4K) images and parametric [Formula: see text](Logan with SC) images had a 5.0-fold and 5.0-fold higher average signal-to-noise ratio and 3.6-fold and 4.1-fold higher average contrast-to-noise ratio compared with conventional SUV images, respectively. In addition, no significant differences in signal-to-noise ratio and contrast-to-noise of pathologic lesions were observed between parametric [Formula: see text](2T4K) images and parametric [Formula: see text](Logan with SC) images (allP> 0.05).Conclusions:The 2T4K model was the preferred compartment model. Total-body parametric imaging of68Ga-FAPI-04 PET yielded superior quantification beyond SUV with enhanced lesion contrast, which may serve as a promising imaging method to make an early diagnosis, to better reflect tumor characterization, or to allow evaluation of treatment response. [Formula: see text](2T4K) images are comparable in image quality and consistent to [Formula: see text](Logan with SC) images in lesions conspicuity; however, [Formula: see text](Logan with SC) images presented an appealing alternative to [Formula: see text](2T4K) images because of their simplicity.

TITLE: Spatiotemporal Kernel Reconstruction for Linear Parametric Neurotransmitter PET Kinetic Modeling in Motion Correction Brain PET of Awake Rats

AUTHORS: Alan Miranda, Daniele Bertoglio, Sigrid Stroobants, Steven Staelens, Jeroen Verhaeghe

JOURNAL: Frontiers in neuroscience

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
The linear parametric neurotransmitter positron emission tomography (lp-ntPET) kinetic model can be used to detect transient changes (activation) in endogenous neurotransmitter levels. Preclinical PET scans in awake animals can be performed to investigate neurotransmitter transient changes. Here we use the spatiotemporal kernel reconstruction (Kernel) for noise reduction in dynamic PET, and lp-ntPET kinetic modeling. Kernel is adapted for motion correction reconstruction, applied in awake rat PET scans. We performed 2D rat brain phantom simulation using the ntPET model at 3 different noise levels. Data was reconstructed with independent frame reconstruction (IFR), IFR with HYPR denoising, and Kernel, and lp-ntPET kinetic parameters (k2a: efflux rate, γ: activation magnitude,td: activation onset time, andtp: activation peak time) were calculated. Additionally, significant activation magnitude (γ) difference with respect to a region with no activation (rest) was calculated. Finally, [11C]raclopride experiments were performed in anesthetized and awake rats, injecting cold raclopride at 20 min after scan start to simulate endogenous neurotransmitter release. For simulated data at the regional level, IFR coefficient of variation (COV) ofk2a, γ,tdandtpwas reduced with HYPR denoising, but Kernel showed the lowest COV (2 fold reduction compared with IFR). At the pixel level the same trend is observed fork2a, γ,tdandtpCOV, but reduction is larger with Kernel compared with IFR (10-14 fold). Bias in γ with respect with noise-free values was additionally reduced using Kernel (difference of 292, 72.4, and -6.92% for IFR, IFR+KYPR, and Kernel, respectively). Significant difference in activation between the rest and active region could be detected at a simulated activation of 160% for IFR and IFR+HYPR, and of 120% for Kernel. In rat experiments, lp-ntPET parameters have better confidence intervals using Kernel. In the γ, andtdparametric maps, the striatum structure can be identified with Kernel but not with IFR. Striatum voxel-wise γ,tdandtpvalues have lower variability using Kernel compared with IFR and IFR+HYPR. The spatiotemporal kernel reconstruction adapted for motion correction reconstruction allows to improve lp-ntPET kinetic modeling noise in awake rat studies, as well as detection of subtle neurotransmitter activations.

TITLE: Multi-organ kinetic modeling for Na[18F]F pre-clinical total-body PET studies

AUTHORS: Jose Benitez-Aurioles, Paul S Clegg, Carlos J Alcaide-Corral, Catriona Wimberley, Adriana A S Tavares

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Background: Total-body positron emission tomography (PET), already well-established in the pre-clinical setting, makes it possible to study multi-parameters in biological systems as a whole, rather than focusing on single tissues analysis. Simultaneous kinetic analysis of multiple organs poses some daunting new challenges.

Purpose: To explore quantifying the pharmacokinetics of Na[18F]F in multiple dissimilar murine organs simultaneously in vivo with total-body PET imaging using different compartmental models for each organ and a shared cardiovascular system.

Methods: Six mice underwent a 60-min total-body PET scan following intravenous bolus injection of Na[18F]F. Compartmental models were constructed for each organ (heart, lungs, liver, kidneys, and bone) using an image derived input function. Non-linear least squares fitting of a model that connects the five organs to a shared cardiovascular system was used to analyze both the first 3 min of data and the full hour. Analysis was repeated 5000 times using different initial parameter values for each duration, permitting analysis of correlations between parameters.

Results: The models give a good qualitative account of the activity curves irrespective of the duration of the data; however, the quality of the fits to 3 min of data (averageis 2.72) was generally better. Comparison of perfusion values to literature values was possible for the liver and lungs with the former (liver, 0.540 ± 0.177 mL/ml/min) being well-above expectations and the latter (lungs, 0.184 ± 0.413 mL/ml/min) in rough agreement. Correlations between microparameter values (especially affecting k2) caused very noticeable problems for data modeling from both the kidneys and the femur.

Conclusion: The present study demonstrates an approach to performing kinetic modeling for multiple organs simultaneously with Na[18F]F. The observed correlations between microparameter values remain a challenge. Nonetheless, many microparameters can be estimated reliably with a quantitative analysis of perfusion being possible for some organs.

TITLE: Feasibility of using abbreviated scan protocols with population-based input functions for accurate kinetic modeling of [18F]-FDG datasets from a long axial FOV PET scanner

AUTHORS: Hasan Sari, Lars Eriksson, Clemens Mingels, Ian Alberts, Michael E Casey, Ali Afshar-Oromieh, Maurizio Conti, Paul Cumming, Kuangyu Shi, Axel Rominger

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Background: Accurate kinetic modeling of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) data requires accurate knowledge of the available tracer concentration in the plasma during the scan time, known as the arterial input function (AIF). The gold standard method to derive the AIF requires collection of serial arterial blood samples, but the introduction of long axial field of view (LAFOV) PET systems enables the use of non-invasive image-derived input functions (IDIFs) from large blood pools such as the aorta without any need for bed movement. However, such protocols require a prolonged dynamic PET acquisition, which is impractical in a busy clinical setting. Population-based input functions (PBIFs) have previously shown potential in accurate Patlak analysis of [18F]-FDG datasets and can enable the use of shortened dynamic imaging protocols. Here, we exploit the high sensitivity and temporal resolution of a LAFOV PET system and explore the use of PBIF with abbreviated protocols in [18F]-FDG total body kinetic modeling.

Methods: Dynamic PET data were acquired in 24 oncological subjects for 65 min following the administration of [18F]-FDG. IDIFs were extracted from the descending thoracic aorta, and a PBIF was generated from 16 datasets. Five different scaled PBIFs (sPBIFs) were generated by scaling the PBIF with the AUC of IDIF curve tails using various portions of image data (35-65, 40-65, 45-65, 50-65, and 55-65 min post-injection). The sPBIFs were compared with the IDIFs using the AUCs and Patlak Kiestimates in tumor lesions and cerebral gray matter. Patlak plot start time (t*) was also varied to evaluate the performance of shorter acquisitions on the accuracy of Patlak Kiestimates. Patlak Kiestimates with IDIF and t* = 35 min were used as reference, and mean bias and precision (standard deviation of bias) were calculated to assess the relative performance of different sPBIFs. A comparison of parametric images generated using IDIF and sPBIFs was also performed.

Results: There was no statistically significant difference between AUCs of the IDIF and sPBIFs (Wilcoxon test: P > 0.05). Excellent agreement was shown between Patlak Kiestimates obtained using sPBIF and IDIF. Using the sPBIF55-65with the Patlak model, 20 min of PET data (i.e., 45 to 65 min post-injection) achieved < 15% precision error in Kiestimates in tumor lesions compared to the estimates with the IDIF. Parametric images reconstructed using the IDIF and sPBIFs with and without an abbreviated protocol were visually comparable. Using Patlak Kigenerated with an IDIF and 30 min of PET data as reference, Patlak Kiimages generated using sPBIF55-65with 20 min of PET data (t* = 45 min) provided excellent image quality with structural similarity index measure > 0.99 and peak signal-to-noise ratio > 55 dB.

Conclusion: We demonstrate the feasibility of performing accurate [18F]-FDG Patlak analysis using sPBIFs with only 20 min of PET data from a LAFOV PET scanner.

ABSTRACT:
Positron emission tomography (PET) radioligands that bind with high-affinity to α4β2-type nicotinic receptors (α4β2Rs) allow for in vivo investigations of the mechanisms underlying nicotine addiction and smoking cessation. Here, we investigate the use of an image-derived arterial input function and the cerebellum for kinetic analysis of radioligand binding in mice. Two radioligands were explored: 2-[18F]FA85380 (2-FA), displaying similar pKa and binding affinity to the smoking cessation drug varenicline (Chantix), and [18F]Nifene, displaying similar pKa and binding affinity to nicotine. Time-activity curves of the left ventricle of the heart displayed similar distribution across wild type mice, mice lacking the β2-subunit for ligand binding, and acute nicotine-treated mice, whereas reference tissue binding displayed high variation between groups. Binding potential estimated from a two-tissue compartment model fit of the data with the image-derived input function were higher than estimates from reference tissue-based estimations. Rate constants of radioligand dissociation were very slow for 2-FA and very fast for Nifene. We conclude that using an image-derived input function for kinetic modeling of nicotinic PET ligands provides suitable results compared to reference tissue-based methods and that the chemical properties of 2-FA and Nifene are suitable to study receptor response to nicotine addiction and smoking cessation therapies.

TITLE: Quantitative Total-Body Imaging of Blood Flow with High Temporal Resolution Early Dynamic 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose PET Kinetic Modeling

AUTHORS: Kevin J Chung, Abhijit J Chaudhari, Lorenzo Nardo, Terry Jones, Moon S Chen Jr, Ramsey D Badawi, Simon R Cherry, Guobao Wang

JOURNAL: medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Quantitative total-body PET imaging of blood flow can be performed with freely diffusible flow radiotracers such as15O-water and11C-butanol, but their short half-lives necessitate close access to a cyclotron. Past efforts to measure blood flow with the widely available radiotracer18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) were limited to tissues with high18F-FDG extraction fraction. In this study, we developed an early-dynamic18F-FDG PET method with high temporal resolution kinetic modeling to assess total-body blood flow based on deriving the vascular transit time of18F-FDG and conducted a pilot comparison study against a11C-butanol reference.

Methods: The first two minutes of dynamic PET scans were reconstructed at high temporal resolution (60×1 s, 30×2 s) to resolve the rapid passage of the radiotracer through blood vessels. In contrast to existing methods that use blood-to-tissue transport rate () as a surrogate of blood flow, our method directly estimates blood flow using a distributed kinetic model (adiabatic approximation to the tissue homogeneity model; AATH). To validate our18F-FDG measurements of blood flow against a flow radiotracer, we analyzed total-body dynamic PET images of six human participants scanned with both18F-FDG and11C-butanol. An additional thirty-four total-body dynamic18F-FDG PET scans of healthy participants were analyzed for comparison against literature blood flow ranges. Regional blood flow was estimated across the body and total-body parametric imaging of blood flow was conducted for visual assessment. AATH and standard compartment model fitting was compared by the Akaike Information Criterion at different temporal resolutions.

Results: 18F-FDG blood flow was in quantitative agreement with flow measured from11C-butanol across same-subject regional measurements (Pearson R=0.955, p<0.001; linear regression y=0.973x-0.012), which was visually corroborated by total-body blood flow parametric imaging. Our method resolved a wide range of blood flow values across the body in broad agreement with literature ranges (e.g., healthy cohort average: 0.51±0.12 ml/min/cm3in the cerebral cortex and 2.03±0.64 ml/min/cm3in the lungs, respectively). High temporal resolution (1 to 2 s) was critical to enabling AATH modeling over standard compartment modeling.

Conclusions: Total-body blood flow imaging was feasible using early-dynamic18F-FDG PET with high-temporal resolution kinetic modeling. Combined with standard18F-FDG PET methods, this method may enable efficient single-tracer flow-metabolism imaging, with numerous research and clinical applications in oncology, cardiovascular disease, pain medicine, and neuroscience.

TITLE: Understanding Rapid PET Degradation via Reactive Molecular Dynamics Simulation and Kinetic Modeling

JOURNAL: The journal of physical chemistry. A

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
As the demand for PET plastic products continues to grow, developing effective processes to reduce their pollution is of critical importance. Pyrolysis, a promising technology to produce lighter and recyclable components from wasted plastic products, has therefore received considerable attention. In this work, the rapid pyrolysis of PET was studied by using reactive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Mechanisms for yielding gas species were unraveled, which involve the generation of ethylene and TPA radicals from ester oxygen-alkyl carbon bond dissociation and condensation reactions to consume TPA radicals with the products of long chains containing a phenyl benzoate structure and CO2. As atomistic simulations are typically conducted at the time scale of a few nanoseconds, a high temperature (i.e., >1000 K) is adopted for accelerated reaction events. To apply the results from MD simulations to practical pyrolysis processes, a kinetic model based on a set of ordinary differential equations was established, which is capable of describing the key products of PET pyrolysis as a function of time and temperature. It was further exploited to determine the optimal reaction conditions for low environmental impact. Overall, this study conducted a detailed mechanism study of PET pyrolysis and established an effective kinetic model for the main species. The approach presented herein to extract kinetic information such as detailed kinetic constants and activation energies from atomistic MD simulations can also be applied to related systems such as the pyrolysis of other polymers.

TITLE: Validation of kinetic modeling of [15O]H2O PET using an image derived input function on hybrid PET/MRI

AUTHORS: Mark B Vestergaard, Oriol P Calvo, Adam E Hansen, Sverre Rosenbaum, Henrik B W Larsson, Otto M Henriksen, Ian Law

JOURNAL: NeuroImage

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
In present study we aimed to validate the use of image-derived input functions (IDIF) in the kinetic modeling of cerebral blood flow (CBF) measured by [15O]H2O PET by comparing with the accepted reference standard arterial input function (AIF). Additional comparisons were made to mean cohort AIF and CBF values acquired by methodologically independent phase-contrast mapping (PCM) MRI. Using hybrid PET/MRI an IDIF was generated by measuring the radiotracer concentration in the internal carotid arteries and correcting for partial volume effects using the intravascular volume measured from MRI-angiograms. Seven patients with carotid steno-occlusive disease and twelve healthy controls were examined at rest, after administration of acetazolamide, and, in the control group, during hyperventilation. Agreement between the techniques was examined by linear regression and Bland-Altman analysis. Global CBF values modeled using IDIF correlated with values from AIF across perfusion states in both patients (p<10-6, R2=0.82, 95% limits of agreement (LoA)=[-11.3-9.9] ml/100 g/min) and controls (p<10-6, R2=0.87, 95% LoA=[-17.1-13.7] ml/100 g/min). The reproducibility of gCBF using IDIF was identical to AIF (15.8%). Values from IDIF and AIF had equally good correlation to measurements by PCM MRI, R2=0.86 and R2=0.84, (p<10-6), respectively. Mean cohort AIF performed substantially worse than individual IDIFs (p<10-6, R2=0.63, LoA=[-12.8-25.3] ml/100 g/min). In the patient group, use of IDIF provided similar reactivity maps compared to AIF. In conclusion, global CBF values modeled using IDIF correlated with values modeled by AIF and similar perfusion deficits could be established in a patient group.

ABSTRACT:
Alterations in synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2 A (SV2A) have been associated with several neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. Therefore, SV2A positron emission tomography (PET) imaging may provide a unique tool to investigate synaptic density dynamics during disease progression and after therapeutic intervention. This study aims to extensively characterize the novel radioligand [18F]SynVesT-1 for preclinical applications. In C57Bl/6J mice (n= 39), we assessed the plasma profile of [18F]SynVesT-1, validated the use of a noninvasive image-derived input function (IDIF) compared to an arterial input function (AIF), performed a blocking study with levetiracetam (50 and 200 mg/kg, i.p.) to verify the specificity towards SV2A, examined kinetic models for volume of distribution (VT) quantification, and explored test-retest reproducibility of [18F]SynVesT-1 in the central nervous system (CNS). Plasma availability of [18F]SynVesT-1 decreased rapidly (13.4 ± 1.5% at 30 min post-injection).VTbased on AIF and IDIF showed excellent agreement (r2= 0.95,p< 0.0001) and could be reliably estimated with a 60-min acquisition. The blocking study resulted in a complete blockade with no suitable reference region. Test-retest analysis indicated good reproducibility (mean absolute variability <10%). In conclusion, [18F]SynVesT-1 is selective for SV2A with optimal kinetics representing a candidate tool to quantify CNS synaptic density non-invasively.

TITLE: 18F-FDG PET and DCE kinetic modeling and their correlations in primary NSCLC: first voxel-wise correlative analysis of human simultaneous [18F]FDG PET-MRI data

JOURNAL: EJNMMI research

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Objectives: To decipher the correlations between PET and DCE kinetic parameters in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), by using voxel-wise analysis of dynamic simultaneous [18F]FDG PET-MRI.

Material and methods: Fourteen treatment-naïve patients with biopsy-proven NSCLC prospectively underwent a 1-h dynamic [18F]FDG thoracic PET-MRI scan including DCE. The PET and DCE data were normalized to their corresponding T1-weighted MR morphological space, and tumors were masked semi-automatically. Voxel-wise parametric maps of PET and DCE kinetic parameters were computed by fitting the dynamic PET and DCE tumor data to the Sokoloff and Extended Tofts models respectively, by using in-house developed procedures. Curve-fitting errors were assessed by computing the relative root mean square error (rRMSE) of the estimated PET and DCE signals at the voxel level. For each tumor, Spearman correlation coefficients (rs) between all the pairs of PET and DCE kinetic parameters were estimated on a voxel-wise basis, along with their respective bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals (n = 1000 iterations).

Results: Curve-fitting metrics provided fit errors under 20% for almost 90% of the PET voxels (median rRMSE = 10.3, interquartile ranges IQR = 8.1; 14.3), whereas 73.3% of the DCE voxels showed fit errors under 45% (median rRMSE = 31.8%, IQR = 22.4; 46.6). The PET-PET, DCE-DCE, and PET-DCE voxel-wise correlations varied according to individual tumor behaviors. Beyond this wide variability, the PET-PET and DCE-DCE correlations were mainly high (absolute rsvalues > 0.7), whereas the PET-DCE correlations were mainly low to moderate (absolute rsvalues < 0.7). Half the tumors showed a hypometabolism with low perfused/vascularized profile, a hallmark of hypoxia, and tumor aggressiveness.

Conclusion: A dynamic "one-stop shop" procedure applied to NSCLC is technically feasible in clinical practice. PET and DCE kinetic parameters assessed simultaneously are not highly correlated in NSCLC, and these correlations showed a wide variability among tumors and patients. These results tend to suggest that PET and DCE kinetic parameters might provide complementary information. In the future, this might make PET-MRI a unique tool to characterize the individual tumor biological behavior in NSCLC.

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Introduction: 11C-DPA-713 is a positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer developed for imaging the expression of the translocator protein (TSPO) in glial cells, which is considered to be a marker of the neuroinflammatory burden. This study investigated the pharmacokinetic profile of11C-DPA-713 and evaluated kinetic modeling and non-invasive TSPO quantification using dynamic PET imaging data in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cognitive normal (CN) participants.

Methods: Eleven patients with AD and 6 CN participants were examined using dynamic11C-DPA-713 PET imaging for 60 min with arterial blood sampling. Time-activity curves were calculated from the cerebellum and three composite regions of interest (ROIs), according to the anatomical definitions of Braak's stages 1 to 3, stage 4, stage 5, and stage 6 that correspond to the pathological stages of tangle deposition. The total distribution volume (VT) was evaluated using compartmental modeling and graphical analysis. Reference region-based methods were implemented using an optimal area that was assumed to be void of the radiotracer target as reference tissue.

Results: The concentration of radioactivity in plasma demonstrated rapid clearance.11C-DPA-713 peaked rapidly in the gray matter. Compartmental modeling resulted in a good fit, and the one-tissue model with estimated blood volume correction (1Tv) showed the best performance. The estimated VTobtained from the graphical plasma methods was highly correlated with that obtained from 1Tv. Reference region-based analysis was conducted using the Braak 6 area as the reference region, and the estimated non-displaceable binding potential was highly correlated with that obtained from 1Tv.

Conclusion: 11C-DPA-713 possesses properties suitable for TSPO quantification with PET imaging. The Braak 6 area was shown to be a useful reference region in the patients with AD and the CN participants, and non-invasive reference tissue models using the Braak 6 area as a reference region can be employed for TSPO quantification with11C-DPA-713-PET imaging as an alternative to the invasive compartmental model.

TITLE: Clinical Characterization of [18F]T-008, a Cholesterol 24-Hydroxylase PET Ligand: Dosimetry, Kinetic Modeling, Variability, and Soticlestat Occupancy

AUTHORS: Cristian C Constantinescu, Terry Brown, Shining Wang, Wei Yin, Olivier Barret, Danna Jennings, Johannes Tauscher

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
This series of studies characterized [18F]T-008, a PET radiotracer for imaging cholesterol 24-hydroxylase (CH24H), in healthy volunteers (ClinicalTrials.gov identifierNCT02497235). Assessments included radiation dosimetry, kinetic modeling, test-retest variability (TRT) evaluation, and a dose occupancy evaluation using soticlestat, a selective CH24H inhibitor. Soticlestat is currently in phase 3 development for the treatment of seizures in Dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.Methods:In the dosimetry study, 5 participants (3 men) underwent serial whole-body scans to estimate organ-absorbed doses and effective doses of [18F]T-008 using OLINDA/EXM 1.1. For the kinetic modeling and TRT study, 6 participants (all men) underwent two 210-min dynamic [18F]T-008 PET scans with arterial blood sampling. The regional total volume of distribution was estimated using a 1-tissue-compartment model, a 2-tissue-compartment model, and Logan graphic analysis. In the dose occupancy study, 11 participants (all men) underwent 120-min scans at baseline and 2 time points (peak and trough) after receiving single oral doses of soticlestat (50-600 mg). The relationship between effect-site soticlestat concentration and brain occupancy was evaluated with a specially developed pharmacokinetic model and a saturable maximal occupancy model.Results:The estimated mean whole-body effective dose was 0.0292 mSv/MBq (SD, 0.00147 mSv/MBq). [18F]T-008 entered the brain rapidly, with a distribution consistent with known CH24H distribution densities. The 2-tissue-compartment model and Logan graphic analysis best described the tracer kinetics. The mean TRT for estimating total volume of distribution was 7%-15%. Single doses of soticlestat in the range 50-600 mg resulted in occupancies of 64%-96% at 2 h and 11%-79% at 24 h. The estimated half-maximal effect-site concentration of soticlestat was 5.52 ng/mL.Conclusion:[18F]T-008 is a suitable PET radiotracer for quantitatively analyzing CH24H in the human brain. Using [18F]T-008 and PET, we demonstrated that soticlestat was brain-penetrant and established target engagement by displacing [18F]T-008 in a dose-dependent manner in the brain.

JOURNAL: Polymers

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
The pyrolysis of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is a well-known process for producing high fuel value. This paper aims to study the kinetics of PET pyrolysis reactions at 4 different heating rates (2, 5, 10, and 20 K min-1) using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) data. TGA data show only one kinetic reaction within the temperature ranges of 650 to 750 K. Five different model-free models, namely, the Freidman (FR), Flynn-Wall-Qzawa (FWO), Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose (KAS), Starink (STK), and distributed activation energy model (DAEM), were fitted to the experimental data to obtain the activation energy () and the pre-exponential factor (A0) of the reaction kinetics. The Coats-Redfern (CR) model equation was fitted with the help of master plot (Criado's) to identify the most convenient reaction mechanism for this system.'s values were determined by the application of the five aforementioned models and were found to possess an average value of 212 kJ mol-1. The mechanism of PET pyrolysis reaction was best described by first-order reaction kinetics; this was confirmed by the compensation. Further thermodynamic parameter analysis indicated that the reaction was endothermic in nature.

TITLE: High-Temporal-Resolution Kinetic Modeling of Lung Tumors with Dual-Blood Input Function Using Total-Body Dynamic PET

AUTHORS: Yiran Wang, Yasser G Abdelhafez, Benjamin A Spencer, Rashmi Verma, Mamta Parikh, Nicholas Stollenwerk, Lorenzo Nardo, Terry Jones, Ramsey D Badawi, Simon R Cherry, Guobao Wang

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
The lungs are supplied by both the pulmonary arteries carrying deoxygenated blood originating from the right ventricle and the bronchial arteries carrying oxygenated blood downstream from the left ventricle. However, this effect of dual blood supply has never been investigated using PET, partially because the temporal resolution of conventional dynamic PET scans is limited. The advent of PET scanners with a long axial field of view, such as the uEXPLORER total-body PET/CT system, permits dynamic imaging with high temporal resolution (HTR). In this work, we modeled the dual-blood input function (DBIF) and studied its impact on the kinetic quantification of normal lung tissue and lung tumors using HTR dynamic PET imaging.Methods:Thirteen healthy subjects and 6 cancer subjects with lung tumors underwent a dynamic18F-FDG scan with the uEXPLORER for 1 h. Data were reconstructed into dynamic frames of 1 s in the early phase. Regional time-activity curves of lung tissue and tumors were analyzed using a 2-tissue compartmental model with 3 different input functions: the right ventricle input function, left ventricle input function, and proposed DBIF, all with time delay and dispersion corrections. These models were compared for time-activity curve fitting quality using the corrected Akaike information criterion and for differentiating lung tumors from lung tissue using the Mann-WhitneyUtest. Voxelwise multiparametric images by the DBIF model were further generated to verify the regional kinetic analysis.Results:The effect of dual blood supply was pronounced in the high-temporal-resolution time-activity curves of lung tumors. The DBIF model achieved better time-activity curve fitting than the other 2 single-input models according to the corrected Akaike information criterion. The estimated fraction of left ventricle input was low in normal lung tissue of healthy subjects but much higher in lung tumors (∼0.04 vs. ∼0.3,P< 0.0003). The DBIF model also showed better robustness in the difference in18F-FDG net influx rate [Formula: see text] and delivery rate [Formula: see text] between lung tumors and normal lung tissue. Multiparametric imaging with the DBIF model further confirmed the differences in tracer kinetics between normal lung tissue and lung tumors.Conclusion:The effect of dual blood supply in the lungs was demonstrated using HTR dynamic imaging and compartmental modeling with the proposed DBIF model. The effect was small in lung tissue but nonnegligible in lung tumors. HTR dynamic imaging with total-body PET can offer a sensitive tool for investigating lung diseases.

TITLE: PET imaging of M4 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in rhesus macaques using [11C]MK-6884: Quantification with kinetic modeling and receptor occupancy by CVL-231 (emraclidine), a novel positive allosteric modulator

ABSTRACT:
Stimulation of the M4muscarinic acetylcholine receptor reduces striatal hyperdopaminergia, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target for schizophrenia. Emraclidine (CVL-231) is a novel, highly selective, positive allosteric modulator (PAM) of M4 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors i.e. acts as a modulator that increases the response of these receptors. First, we aimed to further characterize the positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and quantification performance of a recently developed M4PAM radiotracer, [11C]MK-6884, in non-human primates (NHPs). Second, we applied these results to determine the receptor occupancy of CVL-231 as a function of dose. Using paired baseline-blocking PET scans, we quantified total volume of distribution, binding potential, and receptor occupancy. Both blood-based and reference region-based methods quantified M4receptor levels across brain regions. The 2-tissue 4-parameter kinetic model best fitted regional [11C]MK-6884-time activity curves. Only the caudate nucleus and putamen displayed statistically significant [11C]MK-6884 uptake and dose-dependent blocking by CVL-231. For binding potential and receptor occupancy quantification, the simplified reference tissue model using the grey cerebellum as a reference region was employed. CVL-231 demonstrated dose-dependent M4receptor occupancy in the striatum of the NHP brain and shows promise for further development in clinical trials.

TITLE: Modeling PET Data Acquired During Nonsteady Conditions: What If Brain Conditions Change During the Scan?

ABSTRACT:
Researchers use dynamic PET imaging with target-selective tracer molecules to probe molecular processes. Kinetic models have been developed to describe these processes. The models are typically fitted to the measured PET data with the assumption that the brain is in a steady-state condition for the duration of the scan. The end results are quantitative parameters that characterize the molecular processes. The most common kinetic modeling endpoints are estimates of volume of distribution or the binding potential of a tracer. If the steady state is violated during the scanning period, the standard kinetic models may not apply. To address this issue, time-variant kinetic models have been developed for the characterization of dynamic PET data acquired while significant changes (e.g., short-lived neurotransmitter changes) are occurring in brain processes. These models are intended to extract a transient signal from data. This work in the PET field dates back at least to the 1990s. As interest has grown in imaging nonsteady events, development and refinement of time-variant models has accelerated. These new models, which we classify as belonging to the first, second, or third generation according to their innovation, have used the latest progress in mathematics, image processing, artificial intelligence, and statistics to improve the sensitivity and performance of the earliest practical time-variant models to detect and describe nonsteady phenomena. This review provides a detailed overview of the history of time-variant models in PET. It puts key advancements in the field into historical and scientific context. The sum total of the methods is an ongoing attempt to better understand the nature and implications of neurotransmitter fluctuations and other brief neurochemical phenomena.

TITLE: Short-term PET-derived kinetic estimation for the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma: a combination of the maximum-slope method and dual-input three-compartment model

AUTHORS: Tao Wang, Boqiao Li, Hong Shi, Pengfei Li, Yinglei Deng, Siyu Wang, Qiao Luo, Dongdong Xv, Jianfeng He, Shaobo Wang

JOURNAL: Insights into imaging

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Background: Kinetic estimation provides fitted parameters related to blood flow perfusion and fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) transport and intracellular metabolism to characterize hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) but usually requires 60 min or more for dynamic PET, which is time-consuming and impractical in a busy clinical setting and has poor patient tolerance.

Methods: This study preliminarily evaluated the equivalence of liver kinetic estimation between short-term (5-min dynamic data supplemented with 1-min static data at 60 min postinjection) and fully 60-min dynamic protocols and whether short-term18F-FDG PET-derived kinetic parameters using a three-compartment model can be used to discriminate HCC from the background liver tissue. Then, we proposed a combined model, a combination of the maximum-slope method and a three-compartment model, to improve kinetic estimation.

Results: There is a strong correlation between the kinetic parameters K1~ k3, HPI and [Formula: see text] in the short-term and fully dynamic protocols. With the three-compartment model, HCCs were found to have higher k2, HPI and k3values than background liver tissues, while K1, k4and [Formula: see text] values were not significantly different between HCCs and background liver tissues. With the combined model, HCCs were found to have higher HPI, K1and k2, k3and [Formula: see text] values than background liver tissues; however, the k4value was not significantly different between HCCs and the background liver tissues.

Conclusions: Short-term PET is closely equivalent to fully dynamic PET for liver kinetic estimation. Short-term PET-derived kinetic parameters can be used to distinguish HCC from background liver tissue, and the combined model improves the kinetic estimation.

Clinical relevance statement: Short-term PET could be used for hepatic kinetic parameter estimation. The combined model could improve the estimation of liver kinetic parameters.

JOURNAL: EJNMMI research

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Background: Antiepileptic drugs, levetiracetam (LEV) and brivaracetam (BRV), bind to synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A). In their anti-seizure activity, speed of brain entry may be an important factor. BRV showed faster entry into the human and non-human primate brain, based on more rapid displacement of SV2A tracer11C-UCB-J. To extract additional information from previous human studies, we developed a nonlinear model that accounted for drug entry into the brain and binding to SV2A using brain11C-UCB-J positron emission tomography (PET) data and the time-varying plasma drug concentration, to assess the kinetic parameter K1(brain entry rate) of the drugs.

Method: Displacement (LEV or BRV p.i. 60 min post-tracer injection) and post-dose scans were conducted in five healthy subjects. Blood samples were collected for measurement of drug concentration and the tracer arterial input function. Fitting of nonlinear differential equations was applied simultaneously to time-activity curves (TACs) from displacement and post-dose scans to estimate 5 parameters: K1(drug), K1(11C-UCB-J, displacement), K1(11C-UCB-J, post-dose), free fraction of11C-UCB-J in brain (fND(11C-UCB-J)), and distribution volume of11C-UCB-J (VT(UCB-J)). Other parameters (KD(drug), KD(11C-UCB-J), fP(drug), fP(11C-UCB-J, displacement), fP(11C-UCB-J, post-dose), fND(drug), koff(drug), koff(11C-UCB-J)) were fixed to literature or measured values.

Results: The proposed model described well the TACs in all subjects; however, estimates of drug K1were unstable in comparison with11C-UCB-J K1estimation. To provide a conservative estimate of the relative speed of brain entry for BRV vs. LEV, we determined a lower bound on the ratio BRV K1/LEV K1, by finding the lowest BRV K1or highest LEV K1that were statistically consistent with the data. Specifically, we used the F test to compare the residual sum of squares with fixed BRV K1to that with floating BRV K1to obtain the lowest possible BRV K1; the same analysis was performed to find the highest LEV K1. The lower bound of the ratio BRV K1/LEV K1was ~ 7.

Conclusions: Under appropriate conditions, this advanced nonlinear model can directly estimate entry rates of drugs into tissue by analysis of PET TACs. Using a conservative statistical cutoff, BRV enters the brain at least sevenfold faster than LEV.

ABSTRACT:
Accurate quantification of tau binding from18F-PI-2620 PET requires kinetic modeling and an input function. Here, we implemented a non-invasive Image-derived input function (IDIF) derived using the state-of-the-art total-body uEXPLORER PET/CT scanner to quantify tau binding and tracer delivery rate from18F-PI-2620 in the brain. Additionally, we explored the impact of scan duration on the quantification of kinetic parameters. Total-body PET dynamic data from 15 elderly participants were acquired. Time-activity curves from the grey matter regions of interest (ROIs) were fitted to the two-tissue compartmental model (2TCM) using a subject-specific IDIF derived from the descending aorta. ROI-specific kinetic parameters were estimated for different scan durations ranging from 10 to 90 minutes. Logan graphical analysis was also used to estimate the total distribution volume (VT). Differences in kinetic parameters were observed between ROIs, including significant reduction in tracer delivery rate (K1) in the medial temporal lobe. All kinetic parameters remained relatively stable after the 60-minute scan window across all ROIs, with K1showing high stability after 30 minutes of scan duration. Excellent correlation was observed between VTestimated using 2TCM and Logan plot analysis. This study demonstrated the utility of IDIF with total-body PET in investigating18F-PI-2620 kinetics in the brain.

ABSTRACT:
The traditional design of PET target engagement studies is based on a baseline scan and one or more scans after drug administration. We here evaluate an alternative design in which the drug is administered during an on-going scan (i.e., a displacement study). This approach results both in lower radiation exposure and lower costs. Existing kinetic models assume steady state. This condition is not present during a drug displacement and consequently, our aim here was to develop kinetic models for analysing PET displacement data. We modified existing compartment models to accommodate a time-variant increase in occupancy following the pharmacological in-scan intervention. Since this implies the use of differential equations that cannot be solved analytically, we developed instead one approximate and one numerical solution. Through simulations, we show that if the occupancy is relatively high, it can be estimated without bias and with good accuracy. The models were applied to PET data from six pigs where [11C]UCB-J was displaced by intravenous brivaracetam. The dose-occupancy relationship estimated from these scans showed good agreement with occupancies calculated with Lassen plot applied to baseline-block scans of two pigs. In summary, the proposed models provide a framework to determine target occupancy from a single displacement scan.

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Background: Accurate quantification of tau binding from18F-PI-2620 PET requires kinetic modeling and an input function. We aimed to implement a non-invasive Image-derived input function (IDIF) using the state-of-the-art total-body uEXPLORER PET/CT scanner to quantify tau binding and tracer delivery rate from18F-PI-2620 in the brain. Additionally, we investigated the impact of scan duration on the quantification of kinetic parameters.

Results: 18F-PI-2620 total-body PET dynamic (90 min) data from 15 elderly (66-92 years) participants were acquired. Time-activity curves were obtained from grey matter regions of interest (ROIs) known to be affected in Alzheimer's disease, including the medial temporal lobe, posterior cingulate, and lateral parietal cortex. These curves were fitted to the two-tissue compartmental model (2TCM) using a subject-specific IDIF (plasma and metabolite corrected) derived from the descending aorta. ROI-specific kinetic parameters were estimated for different scan durations ranging from 10 to 90 min. The parameters included blood fraction volume (vb), rate constants (K1, k2, k3, k4), total distribution volume (VT), distribution volume ratio (DVR), and tracer arrival delay. Logan graphical analysis was also used to estimate VTand compared with 2TCM. Differences in kinetic parameters were observed between ROIs, including significant reduction in tracer delivery rate (K1) in the medial temporal lobe (q < 0.001). All kinetic parameters remained relatively stable (compared to parameters quantified with full 90-minute data) after the 60-minute scan window across all ROIs (r ≥ 0.89; p < 0.001), with K1showing high stability after 30 min of scan duration (r ≥ 0.92; p < 0.001). Excellent correlation was observed between VTestimated using 2TCM and Logan plot analysis (r ≥ 0.96; p < 0.001).

Conclusions: This study demonstrated the utility of IDIF from a lager blood pool, derived using the total-body PET in quantifying18F-PI-2620 kinetics in the brain. Our findings suggest that a 60-minute scan window may be required for the reliable quantification of kinetic parameters using IDIF, whereas a 30-minute scan time may be sufficient for the quantification of K1.

ABSTRACT:
The histamine H3receptor has been considered as a target for the treatment of various central nervous system diseases. Positron emission tomography (PET) studies with the radiolabeled potent and selective histamine H3receptor antagonist [11C]GSK-189254 in rodents could be used to examine the mechanisms of action of novel therapeutic drugs or to assess changes of regional H3receptor density in animal models of neurodegenerative disease. [11C]GSK-189254 was intravenously administered to healthy Wistar rats (n= 10), and a 60 min dynamic PET scan was carried out. Arterial blood samples were obtained during the scan to generate a metabolite-corrected plasma input function. PET data were analyzed using a one-tissue compartment model (1T2k), irreversible (2T3k) or reversible two-tissue compartment models (2T4k), graphical analysis (Logan and Patlak), reference tissue models (SRTM and SRTM2), and standard uptake values (SUVs). The Akaike information criterion and the standard error of the estimated parameters were used to select the most optimal quantification method. This study demonstrated that the 2T4k model with a fixed blood volume fraction and Logan graphical analysis can best describe the kinetics of [11C]GSK-189254 in the rat brain. SUV40-60and the reference tissue-based measurements DVR(2T4k), BPND(SRTM), and SUV ratio could also be used as a simplified method to estimate H3receptor availability in case blood sampling is not feasible.

ABSTRACT:
The κ-opioid receptor (KOR) is implicated in various neuropsychiatric disorders. We previously evaluated an agonist tracer,11C-GR103545, for PET imaging of KOR in humans. Although11C-GR103545 showed high brain uptake, good binding specificity, and selectivity for KOR, it displayed slow kinetics and relatively large test-retest variability of total distribution volume (VT) estimates (15%). Therefore, we set out to develop 2 novel KOR agonist radiotracers,11C-EKAP and11C-FEKAP. In nonhuman primates, both tracers exhibited faster kinetics than11C-GR103545 and comparable binding parameters to11C-GR103545. The aim of this study was to assess their kinetic and binding properties in humans.Methods:Six healthy subjects underwent 120-min test-retest PET scans with both11C-EKAP and11C-FEKAP. Metabolite-corrected arterial input functions were measured. Regional time-activity curves were generated for 14 regions of interest. One-tissue-compartment and 2-tissue-compartment (2TC) models and the multilinear analysis-1 (MA1) method were applied to the regional time-activity curves to calculateVTThe time stability ofVTand test-retest reproducibility were evaluated. Levels of specific binding, as measured by the nondisplaceable binding potential (BPND) for the 3 tracers (11C-EKAP,11C-FEKAP, and11C-GR103545), were compared using a graphical method.Results:For both tracers, regional time-activity curves were fitted well with the 2TC model and MA1 method (t* = 20 min) but not with the 1-tissue-compartment model. Given the unreliably estimated parameters in several fits with the 2TC model and a goodVTmatch between MA1 and 2TC, MA1 was chosen as the appropriate model for both tracers. Mean MA1VTwas highest for11C-GR103545, followed by11C-EKAP and then11C-FEKAP. The minimum scan time for stableVTmeasurement was 90 and 110 min for11C-EKAP and11C-FEKAP, respectively, compared with 140 min for11C-GR103545. The mean absolute test-retest variability in MA1VTestimates was 7% and 18% for11C-EKAP and11C-FEKAP, respectively.BPNDlevels were similar for11C-FEKAP and11C-GR103545 but were about 25% lower for11C-EKAP.Conclusion:The 2 novel KOR agonist tracers showed faster tissue kinetics than11C-GR103545. Even with a slightly lowerBPND,11C-EKAP is judged to be a better tracer for imaging and quantification of KOR in humans, on the basis of the shorter minimum scan time and the excellent test-retest reproducibility of regionalVT.

ABSTRACT:
Recently, PET systems with a long axial field of view have become the current state of the art. Total-body PET scanners enable unique possibilities for scientific research and clinical diagnostics, but this new technology also raises numerous challenges. A key advantage of total-body imaging is that having all the organs in the field of view allows studying biologic interaction of all organs simultaneously. One of the new, promising imaging techniques is total-body quantitative perfusion imaging. Currently,15O-labeled water provides a feasible option for quantitation of tissue perfusion at the total-body level. This review summarizes the status of the methodology and the analysis and provides examples of preliminary findings on applications of quantitative parametric perfusion images for research and clinical work. We also describe the opportunities and challenges arising from moving from single-organ studies to modeling of a multisystem approach with total-body PET, and we discuss future directions for total-body imaging.

TITLE: Comparison of Tracer Kinetic Models for 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET in Intermediate Risk Primary Prostate Cancer Patients

AUTHORS: Nathaniel J Smith, Mark A Green, Clinton D Bahler, Mark Tann, Wendy Territo, Anne M Smith, Gary D Hutchins

JOURNAL: Research square

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Background: 68Ga-PSMA-11 positron emission tomography enables the detection of primary, recurrent, and metastatic prostate cancer. Regional radiopharmaceutical uptake is generally evaluated in static images and quantified as standard uptake values (SUV) for clinical decision-making. However, analysis of dynamic images characterizing both tracer uptake and pharmacokinetics may offer added insights into the underlying tissue pathophysiology. This study was undertaken to evaluate the suitability of various kinetic models for68Ga-PSMA-11 PET analysis. Twenty-three lesions in 18 patients were included in a retrospective kinetic evaluation of 55-minute dynamic68Ga-PSMA-11 pre-prostatectomy PET scans from patients with biopsy-demonstrated intermediate to high-risk prostate cancer. A reversible one-tissue compartment model, irreversible two-tissue compartment model, and a reversible two-tissue compartment model were evaluated for their goodness-of-fit to lesion and normal reference prostate time-activity curves. Kinetic parameters obtained through graphical analysis and tracer kinetic modeling techniques were compared for reference prostate tissue and lesion regions of interest.

Results: Supported by goodness-of-fit and information loss criteria, the irreversible two-tissue compartment model was selected as optimally fitting the time-activity curves. Lesions exhibited significant differences in kinetic rate constants (K1, k2, k3, Ki) and semiquantitative measures (SUV) when compared with reference prostatic tissue. The two-tissue irreversible tracer kinetic model was consistently appropriate across prostatic zones.

Conclusions: An irreversible tracer kinetic model is appropriate for dynamic analysis of68Ga-PSMA-11 PET images. Kinetic parameters estimated by Patlak graphical analysis or full compartmental analysis can distinguish tumor from normal prostate tissue.

AUTHORS: Mohammad Amin Abazari, Madjid Soltani, Farshad Moradi Kashkooli, Kaamran Raahemifar

JOURNAL: Cancers

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
No previous works have attempted to combine generative adversarial network (GAN) architectures and the biomathematical modeling of positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer uptake in tumors to generate extra training samples. Here, we developed a novel computational model to produce synthetic 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) PET images of solid tumors in different stages of progression and angiogenesis. First, a comprehensive biomathematical model is employed for creating tumor-induced angiogenesis, intravascular and extravascular fluid flow, as well as modeling of the transport phenomena and reaction processes of 18F-FDG in a tumor microenvironment. Then, a deep convolutional GAN (DCGAN) model is employed for producing synthetic PET images using 170 input images of 18F-FDG uptake in each of 10 different tumor microvascular networks. The interstitial fluid parameters and spatiotemporal distribution of 18F-FDG uptake in tumor and healthy tissues have been compared against previously published numerical and experimental studies, indicating the accuracy of the model. The structural similarity index measure (SSIM) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of the generated PET sample and the experimental one are 0.72 and 28.53, respectively. Our results demonstrate that a combination of biomathematical modeling and GAN-based augmentation models provides a robust framework for the non-invasive and accurate generation of synthetic PET images of solid tumors in different stages.

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear cardiology : official publication of the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Objective: To evaluate the feasibility of kinetic modeling-based approaches from [18F]-Flobetaben dynamic PET images as a non-invasive diagnostic method for cardiac amyloidosis (CA) and to identify the two AL- and ATTR-subtypes.

Methods and results: Twenty-one patients with diagnoses of CA (11 patients with AL-subtype and 10 patients with ATTR-subtype of CA) and 15 Control patients with no-CA conditions underwent PET/CT imaging after [18F]Florbetaben bolus injection. A two-tissue-compartment (2TC) kinetic model was fitted to time-activity curves (TAC) obtained from left ventricle wall and left atrium cavity ROIs to estimate kinetic micro- and macro-parameters. Combinations of kinetic parameters were evaluated with the purpose of distinguishing Control subjects and CA patients, and to correctly label the last ones as AL- or ATTR-subtype. Resulting sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for Control subjects were: 0.87, 0.9, 0.89; as far as CA patients, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were respectively 0.9, 1, and 0.97 for AL-CA patients and 0.9, 0.92, 0.97 for ATTR-CA patients.

Conclusion: Pharmacokinetic analysis based on a 2TC model allows cardiac amyloidosis characterization from dynamic [18F]Florbetaben PET images. Estimated model parameters allows to not only distinguish between Control subjects and patients, but also between AL- and ATTR-amyloid patients.

TITLE: Pyrolysis Kinetic Behavior and Thermodynamic Analysis of PET Nonwoven Fabric

AUTHORS: Samy Yousef, Justas Eimontas, Nerijus Striūgas, Alaa Mohamed, Mohammed Ali Abdelnaby

JOURNAL: Materials (Basel, Switzerland)

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
This research aims to maximize polyethylene terephthalate (PET) nonwoven fabric waste and make it as a new source for benzoic acid extraction using a pyrolysis process. The treatment was performed using a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) and released products were characterized using FTIR spectroscopy and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The pyrolysis kinetic and thermodynamic behavior of PET fabric was also studied and simulated using different linear and nonlinear models. The results show that the PET fabric is very rich in volatile matter (80 wt.%) and can completely degrade under 490 °C with a weight loss of 84%. Meanwhile, the generated vapor was rich in the carbonylic C=O functional group (FTIR), and the GC-MS analysis concluded that benzoic acid was the major compound with an abundance of 75% that was achieved at the lowest heating rate (5 °C/min). The linear kinetic results showed that PET samples had an activation energy in the ranges of 193-256 kJ/mol (linear models) and ~161 kJ/mol (nonlinear models). The thermodynamic parameters, including enthalpy, Gibbs free energy, and entropy, were estimated in the ranges of 149-250 kJ/mol, 153-232 kJ/mol, and 256-356 J/mol K, respectively. Accordingly, pyrolysis treatment can be used to extract benzoic acid from PET fabric waste with a 134% increase in the benzoic acid abundance that can be recovered from PET bottle plastic waste.

TITLE: Modeling [11C]yohimbine PET human brain kinetics with test-retest reliability, competition sensitivity studies and search for a suitable reference region

AUTHORS: Chloé Laurencin, Sophie Lancelot, Florent Gobert, Jérôme Redouté, Inés Mérida, Thibault Iecker, François Liger, Zacharie Irace, Elise Greusard, Ludovic Lamberet, Didier Le Bars, Nicolas Costes, Bénédicte Ballanger

JOURNAL: NeuroImage

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Previous work introduced the [11C]yohimbine as a suitable ligand of central α2-adrenoreceptors (α2-ARs) for PET imaging. However, reproducibility of [11C]yohimbine PET measurements in healthy humans estimated with a simplified modeling method with reference region, as well as sensitivity of [11C]yohimbine to noradrenergic competition were not evaluated. The objectives of the present study were therefore to fill this gap.

Methods: Thirteen healthy humans underwent two [11C]yohimbine 90-minute dynamic scans performed on a PET-MRI scanner. Seven had arterial blood sampling with metabolite assessment and plasmatic yohimbine free fraction evaluation at the first scan to have arterial input function and test appropriate kinetic modeling. The second scan was a simple retest for 6 subjects to evaluate the test-retest reproducibility. For the remaining 7 subjects the second scan was a challenge study with the administration of a single oral dose of 150 µg of clonidine 90 min before the PET scan. Parametric images of α2-ARs distribution volume ratios (DVR) were generated with two non-invasive models: Logan graphical analysis with Reference (LREF) and Simplified Reference Tissue Method (SRTM). Three reference regions (cerebellum white matter (CERWM), frontal white matter (FLWM), and corpus callosum (CC)) were tested.

Results: We showed high test-retest reproducibility of DVR estimation with LREF and SRTM regardless of reference region (CC, CERWM, FLWM). The best fit was obtained with SRTMCC(r2=0.94). Test-retest showed that the SRTMCCis highly reproducible (mean ICC>0.7), with a slight bias (-1.8%), whereas SRTMCERWMhad lower bias (-0.1%), and excellent ICC (mean>0.8). Using SRTMCC, regional changes have been observed after clonidine administration with a significant increase reported in the amygdala and striatum as well as in several posterior cortical areas as revealed with the voxel-based analysis.

Conclusion: The results add experimental support for the suitability of [11C]yohimbine PET in the quantitative assessment of α2-ARs occupancy in vivo in the human brain. Trial registration EudraCT 2018-000380-82.

Background: Kinetic parameters estimated with dynamic18F-FDG PET/CT can help to characterize hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We aim to evaluate the feasibility of the gravitational search algorithm (GSA) for kinetic parameter estimation and to propose a dynamic chaotic gravitational search algorithm (DCGSA) to enhance parameter estimation.

Methods: Five-minute dynamic PET/CT data of 20 HCCs were prospectively enrolled, and the kinetic parameters k1~ k4and the hepatic arterial perfusion index (HPI) were estimated with a dual-input three-compartment model based on nonlinear least squares (NLLS), GSA and DCGSA.

Results: The results showed that there were significant differences between the HCCs and background liver tissues for k1, k4and the HPI of NLLS; k1, k3, k4and the HPI of GSA; and k1, k2, k3, k4and the HPI of DCGSA. DCGSA had a higher diagnostic performance for k3than NLLS and GSA.

Conclusions: GSA enables accurate estimation of the kinetic parameters of dynamic PET/CT in the diagnosis of HCC, and DCGSA can enhance the diagnostic performance.

ABSTRACT:
Pharmacokinetic modelling with arterial sampling is the gold standard for analysing dynamic PET data of the brain. However, the invasive character of arterial sampling prevents its widespread clinical application. Several methods have been developed to avoid arterial sampling, in particular reference region methods. Unfortunately, for some tracers or diseases, no suitable reference region can be defined. For these cases, other potentially non-invasive approaches have been proposed: (1) a population based input function (PBIF), (2) an image derived input function (IDIF), or (3) simultaneous estimation of the input function (SIME). This systematic review aims to assess the correspondence of these non-invasive methods with the gold standard. Studies comparing non-invasive pharmacokinetic modelling methods with the current gold standard methods using an input function derived from arterial blood samples were retrieved from PubMed/MEDLINE (until December 2021). Correlation measurements were extracted from the studies. The search yielded 30 studies that correlated outcome parameters (VT, DVR, or BPNDfor reversible tracers; Kior CMRglufor irreversible tracers) from a potentially non-invasive method with those obtained from modelling using an arterial input function. Some studies provided similar results for PBIF, IDIF, and SIME-based methods as for modelling with an arterial input function (R2= 0.59-1.00, R2= 0.71-1.00, R2= 0.56-0.96, respectively), if the non-invasive input curve was calibrated with arterial blood samples. Even when the non-invasive input curve was calibrated with venous blood samples or when no calibration was applied, moderate to good correlations were reported, especially for the IDIF and SIME (R2= 0.71-1.00 and R2= 0.36-0.96, respectively). Overall, this systematic review illustrates that non-invasive methods to generate an input function are still in their infancy. Yet, IDIF and SIME performed well, not only with arterial blood calibration, but also with venous or no blood calibration, especially for some tracers without plasma metabolites, which would potentially make these methods better suited for clinical application. However, these methods should still be properly validated for each individual tracer and application before implementation.

TITLE: Compartment model-based nonlinear unmixing for kinetic analysis of dynamic PET images

AUTHORS: Yanna Cruz Cavalcanti, Thomas Oberlin, Vinicius Ferraris, Nicolas Dobigeon, Maria Ribeiro, Clovis Tauber

JOURNAL: Medical image analysis

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
When no arterial input function is available, quantification of dynamic PET images requires a previous step devoted to the extraction of a reference time-activity curve (TAC). Factor analysis is often applied for this purpose. This paper introduces a novel approach that conducts a new kind of nonlinear factor analysis relying on a compartment model, and computes the kinetic parameters of specific binding tissues jointly. To this end, it capitalizes on data-driven parametric imaging methods to provide a physical description of the underlying PET data, directly relating the specific binding with the kinetics of the non-specific binding in the corresponding tissues. This characterization is introduced into the factor analysis formulation to yield a novel nonlinear unmixing model designed for PET image analysis. This model also explicitly introduces global kinetic parameters that allow for a direct estimation of a binding potential that represents the ratio at equilibrium of specifically bound radioligand to the concentration of nondisplaceable radioligand in each non-specific binding tissue. The performance of the method is evaluated on synthetic and real data to demonstrate its potential interest.

TITLE: PET-ABC: fully Bayesian likelihood-free inference for kinetic models

AUTHORS: Yanan Fan, Gaelle Emvalomenos, Clara Grazian, Steven R Meikle

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Aims.We describe an intuitive, easy to use method called PET-ABC that enables full Bayesian statistical inference from single subject dynamic PET data. The performance of PET-ABC was compared with weighted non-linear least squares (WNLS) in terms of reliability of kinetic parameter estimation and statistical power for model selection.Methods.Dynamic PET data based on 1-tissue and 2-tissue compartmental models were simulated with 2 noise models and 3 noise levels. PET-ABC was used to evaluate the reliability of parameter estimates under each condition. It was also used to perform model selection for a simulated noisy dataset composed of a mixture of 1- and 2-tissue compartment kinetics. Finally, PET-ABC was used to analyze a non-steady state dynamic [11C] raclopride study performed on a fully conscious rat administered either 2 mg.kg-1amphetamine or saline 20 min after tracer injection.Results.PET-ABC yielded posterior point estimates for model parameters with smaller variance than WNLS, as well as probability density functions indicating confidence intervals for those estimates. It successfully identified the superiority of a 2-tissue compartment model to fit the simulated mixed model data. For the drug challenge study, the post observation probability of striatal displacement of the PET signal was 0.9 for amphetamine and approximately 0 for saline, indicating a high probability of amphetamine-induced endogenous dopamine release in the striatum. PET-ABC also demonstrated superior statistical power to WNLS (0.87 versus 0.09) for selecting the correct model in a simulated ligand displacement study.Conclusions.PET-ABC is a simple and intuitive method that provides complete Bayesian statistical analysis of single subject dynamic PET data, including the extent to which model parameter estimates and model choice are supported by the data. Software for PET-ABC is freely available as part of thePETabcpackagehttps://github.com/cgrazian/PETabc.

JOURNAL: IEEE transactions on radiation and plasma medical sciences

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Cardiac18F-FDG PET has been used in clinics to assess myocardial glucose metabolism. Its ability for imaging myocardial glucose transport, however, has rarely been exploited in clinics. Using the dynamic FDG-PET scans of ten patients with coronary artery disease, we investigate in this paper appropriate dynamic scan and kinetic modeling protocols for efficient quantification of myocardial glucose transport. Three kinetic models and the effect of scan duration were evaluated by using statistical fit quality, assessing the impact on kinetic quantification, and analyzing the practical identifiability. The results show that the kinetic model selection depends on the scan duration. The reversible two-tissue model was needed for a one-hour dynamic scan. The irreversible two-tissue model was optimal for a scan duration of around 10-15 minutes. If the scan duration was shortened to 2-3 minutes, a one-tissue model was the most appropriate. For global quantification of myocardial glucose transport, we demonstrated that an early dynamic scan with a duration of 10-15 minutes and irreversible kinetic modeling was comparable to the full one-hour scan with reversible kinetic modeling. Myocardial glucose transport quantification provides an additional physiological parameter on top of the existing assessment of glucose metabolism and has the potential to enable single tracer multiparametric imaging in the myocardium.

TITLE: Total-Body PET Multiparametric Imaging of Cancer Using a Voxelwise Strategy of Compartmental Modeling

AUTHORS: Guobao Wang, Lorenzo Nardo, Mamta Parikh, Yasser G Abdelhafez, Elizabeth Li, Benjamin A Spencer, Jinyi Qi, Terry Jones, Simon R Cherry, Ramsey D Badawi

ABSTRACT:
Quantitative dynamic PET with compartmental modeling has the potential to enable multiparametric imaging and more accurate quantification than static PET imaging. Conventional methods for parametric imaging commonly use a single kinetic model for all image voxels and neglect the heterogeneity of physiologic models, which can work well for single-organ parametric imaging but may significantly compromise total-body parametric imaging on a scanner with a long axial field of view. In this paper, we evaluate the necessity of voxelwise compartmental modeling strategies, including time delay correction (TDC) and model selection, for total-body multiparametric imaging.Methods:Ten subjects (5 patients with metastatic cancer and 5 healthy volunteers) were scanned on a total-body PET/CT system after injection of 370 MBq of18F-FDG. Dynamic data were acquired for 60 min. Total-body parametric imaging was performed using 2 approaches. One was the conventional method that uses a single irreversible 2-tissue-compartment model with and without TDC. The second approach selects the best kinetic model from 3 candidate models for individual voxels. The differences between the 2 approaches were evaluated for parametric imaging of microkinetic parameters and the18F-FDG net influx rate,KiResults:TDC had a nonnegligible effect on kinetic quantification of various organs and lesions. The effect was larger in lesions with a higher blood volume. Parametric imaging ofKiwith the standard 2-tissue-compartment model introduced vascular-region artifacts, which were overcome by the voxelwise model selection strategy.Conclusion:The time delay and appropriate kinetic model vary in different organs and lesions. Modeling of the time delay of the blood input function and model selection improved total-body multiparametric imaging.

ABSTRACT:
Blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption is involved in the pathogenesis and progression of many neurological and systemic diseases. Non-invasive assessment of BBB permeability in humans has mainly been performed with dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging, evaluating the BBB as a structural barrier. Here, we developed a novel non-invasive positron emission tomography (PET) method in humans to measure the BBB permeability of molecular radiotracers that cross the BBB through different transport mechanisms. Our method uses high-temporal resolution dynamic imaging and kinetic modeling to jointly estimate cerebral blood flow and tracer-specific BBB transport rate from a single dynamic PET scan and measure the molecular permeability-surface area (PS) product of the radiotracer. We show our method can resolve BBB PS across three PET radiotracers with greatly differing permeabilities, measure reductions in BBB PS of18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) in healthy aging, and demonstrate a possible brain-body association between decreased FDG BBB PS in patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver inflammation. Our method opens new directions to efficiently study the molecular permeability of the human BBBin vivousing the large catalogue of available molecular PET tracers.

TITLE: Kinetic Modeling of 18F-(2 S, 4 R)4-Fluoroglutamine in Mouse Models of Breast Cancer to Estimate Glutamine Pool Size as an Indicator of Tumor Glutamine Metabolism

AUTHORS: Varsha Viswanath, Rong Zhou, Hsiaoju Lee, Shihong Li, Abigail Cragin, Robert K Doot, David A Mankoff, Austin R Pantel

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
The PET radiotracer18F-(2S,4R)4-fluoroglutamine (18F-Gln) reflects glutamine transport and can be used to infer glutamine metabolism. Mouse xenograft studies have demonstrated that18F-Gln uptake correlates directly with glutamine pool size and is inversely related to glutamine metabolism through the glutaminase enzyme. To provide a framework for the analysis of18F-Gln-PET, we have examined18F-Gln uptake kinetics in mouse models of breast cancer at baseline and after inhibition of glutaminase. We describe results of the preclinical analysis and computer simulations with the goal of model validation and performance assessment in anticipation of human breast cancer patient studies.Methods:Triple-negative breast cancer and receptor-positive xenografts were implanted in athymic mice. PET mouse imaging was performed at baseline and after treatment with a glutaminase inhibitor or a vehicle solution for 4 mouse groups. Dynamic PET images were obtained for 1 h beginning at the time of intravenous injection of18F-Gln. Kinetic analysis and computer simulations were performed on representative time-activity curves, testing 1- and 2-compartment models to describe kinetics.Results:Dynamic imaging for 1 h captured blood and tumor time-activity curves indicative of largely reversible uptake of18F-Gln in tumors. Consistent with this observation, a 2-compartment model indicated a relatively low estimate of the rate constant of tracer trapping, suggesting that the 1-compartment model is preferable. Logan plot graphical analysis demonstrated late linearity, supporting reversible kinetics and modeling with a single compartment. Analysis of the mouse data and simulations suggests that estimates of glutamine pool size, specifically the distribution volume (VD) for18F-Gln, were more reliable using the 1-compartment reversible model than the 2-compartment irreversible model. Tumor-to-blood ratios, a more practical potential proxy of VD, correlated well with volume of distribution from single-compartment models and Logan analyses.Conclusion:Kinetic analysis of dynamic18F-Gln-PET images demonstrated the ability to measure VDto estimate glutamine pool size, a key indicator of cellular glutamine metabolism, by both a 1-compartment model and Logan analysis. Changes in VDwith glutaminase inhibition support the ability to assess response to glutamine metabolism-targeted therapy. Concordance of kinetic measures with tumor-to-blood ratios provides a clinically feasible approach to human imaging.

ABSTRACT:
With most of the T cells residing in the tissue, not the blood, developing noninvasive methods for in vivo quantification of their biodistribution and kinetics is important for studying their role in immune response and memory. This study presents the first use of dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) and kinetic modeling for in vivo measurement of CD8+T cell biodistribution in humans. A89Zr-labeled CD8-targeted minibody (89Zr-Df-Crefmirlimab) was used with total-body PET in healthy individuals (N= 3) and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) convalescent patients (N= 5). Kinetic modeling results aligned with T cell-trafficking effects expected in lymphoid organs. Tissue-to-blood ratios from the first 7 hours of imaging were higher in bone marrow of COVID-19 convalescent patients compared to controls, with an increasing trend between 2 and 6 months after infection, consistent with modeled net influx rates and peripheral blood flow cytometry analysis. These results provide a promising platform for using dynamic PET to study the total-body immune response and memory.

TITLE: Total-Body Perfusion Imaging with [11C]-Butanol

AUTHORS: Elizabeth J Li, Javier E López, Benjamin A Spencer, Yasser Abdelhafez, Ramsey D Badawi, Guobao Wang, Simon R Cherry

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Tissue perfusion can be affected by physiology or disease. With the advent of total-body PET, quantitative measurement of perfusion across the entire body is possible. [11C]-butanol is a perfusion tracer with a superior extraction fraction compared with [15O]-water and [13N]-ammonia. To develop the methodology for total-body perfusion imaging, a pilot study using [11C]-butanol on the uEXPLORER total-body PET/CT scanner was conducted.Methods:Eight participants (6 healthy volunteers and 2 patients with peripheral vascular disease [PVD]) were injected with a bolus of [11C]-butanol and underwent 30-min dynamic acquisitions. Three healthy volunteers underwent repeat studies at rest (baseline) to assess test-retest reproducibility; 1 volunteer underwent paired rest and cold pressor test (CPT) studies. Changes in perfusion were measured in the paired rest-CPT study. For PVD patients, local changes in perfusion were investigated and correlated with patient medical history. Regional and parametric kinetic analysis methods were developed using a 1-tissue compartment model and leading-edge delay correction.Results:Estimated baseline perfusion values ranged from 0.02 to 1.95 mL·min-1·cm-3across organs. Test-retest analysis showed that repeat baseline perfusion measurements were highly correlated (slope, 0.99; Pearsonr= 0.96,P< 0.001). For the CPT subject, the largest regional increases were in skeletal muscle (psoas, 142%) and the myocardium (64%). One of the PVD patients showed increased collateral vessel growth in the calf because of a peripheral stenosis. Comorbidities including myocardial infarction, hypothyroidism, and renal failure were correlated with variations in organ-specific perfusion.Conclusion:This pilot study demonstrates the ability to obtain reproducible measurements of total-body perfusion using [11C]-butanol. The methods are sensitive to local perturbations in flow because of physiologic stressors and disease.

TITLE: Comparison of tracer kinetic models for 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET in intermediate-risk primary prostate cancer patients

AUTHORS: Nathaniel J Smith, Mark A Green, Clinton D Bahler, Mark Tann, Wendy Territo, Anne M Smith, Gary D Hutchins

JOURNAL: EJNMMI research

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Background: 68Ga-PSMA-11 positron emission tomography enables the detection of primary, recurrent, and metastatic prostate cancer. Regional radiopharmaceutical uptake is generally evaluated in static images and quantified as standard uptake values (SUVs) for clinical decision-making. However, analysis of dynamic images characterizing both tracer uptake and pharmacokinetics may offer added insights into the underlying tissue pathophysiology. This study was undertaken to evaluate the suitability of various kinetic models for68Ga-PSMA-11 PET analysis. Twenty-three lesions in 18 patients were included in a retrospective kinetic evaluation of 55-min dynamic68Ga-PSMA-11 pre-prostatectomy PET scans from patients with biopsy-demonstrated intermediate- to high-risk prostate cancer. Three kinetic models-a reversible one-tissue compartment model, an irreversible two-tissue compartment model, and a reversible two-tissue compartment model, were evaluated for their goodness of fit to lesion and normal reference prostate time-activity curves. Kinetic parameters obtained through graphical analysis and tracer kinetic modeling techniques were compared for reference prostate tissue and lesion regions of interest.

Results: Supported by goodness of fit and information loss criteria, the irreversible two-tissue compartment model optimally fit the time-activity curves. Lesions exhibited significant differences in kinetic rate constants (K1, k2, k3, Ki) and semiquantitative measures (SUV and %ID/kg) when compared with reference prostatic tissue. The two-tissue irreversible tracer kinetic model was consistently appropriate across prostatic zones.

Conclusions: An irreversible tracer kinetic model is appropriate for dynamic analysis of68Ga-PSMA-11 PET images. Kinetic parameters estimated by Patlak graphical analysis or full compartmental analysis can distinguish tumor from normal prostate tissue.

TITLE: Kinetic model-informed deep learning for multiplexed PET image separation

AUTHORS: Bolin Pan, Paul K Marsden, Andrew J Reader

JOURNAL: EJNMMI physics

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Background: Multiplexed positron emission tomography (mPET) imaging can measure physiological and pathological information from different tracers simultaneously in a single scan. Separation of the multiplexed PET signals within a single PET scan is challenging due to the fact that each tracer gives rise to indistinguishable 511 keV photon pairs, and thus no unique energy information for differentiating the source of each photon pair.

Methods: Recently, many applications of deep learning for mPET image separation have been concentrated on pure data-driven methods, e.g., training a neural network to separate mPET images into single-tracer dynamic/static images. These methods use over-parameterized networks with only a very weak inductive prior. In this work, we improve the inductive prior of the deep network by incorporating a general kinetic model based on spectral analysis. The model is incorporated, along with deep networks, into an unrolled image-space version of an iterative fully 4D PET reconstruction algorithm.

Results: The performance of the proposed method was evaluated on a simulated brain image dataset for dual-tracer [F]FDG+[C]MET PET image separation. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve separation performance comparable to that obtained with single-tracer imaging. In addition, the proposed method outperformed the model-based separation methods (the conventional voxel-wise multi-tracer compartment modeling method (v-MTCM) and the image-space dual-tracer version of the fully 4D PET image reconstruction algorithm (IS-F4D)), as well as a pure data-driven separation [using a convolutional encoder-decoder (CED)], with fewer training examples.

Conclusions: This work proposes a kinetic model-informed unrolled deep learning method for mPET image separation. In simulation studies, the method proved able to outperform both the conventional v-MTCM method and a pure data-driven CED with less training data.

TITLE: Kinetic parameter estimation of hepatocellular carcinoma on 18 F-FDG PET/CT based on Bayesian method

AUTHORS: Jianfeng He, Yongjin Li, Tao Wang, Yinglei Deng, Shaobo Wang

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Background: Dynamic PET/CT combined with a dual-input three-compartment model can be applied to assess the kinetic parameters of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The nonlinear least squares (NLLS) method is the most common method for fitting model parameters; however, some limitations remain.

Purpose: A novel Bayesian-based method was compared with the NLLS method to estimate the kinetic parameters for differentiating HCCs from background liver tissue.

Methods: The proposed Bayesian method combined a priori knowledge of the physiological range and likelihood functions of HCC lesions to obtain HCC PET/CT measurements. Metropolis-Hastings sampling was used to numerically estimate the posterior distribution. This study used 5-minute dynamic PET imaging and 1-minute static PET imaging acquired 60 min post-injection from 19 HCC lesions and 17 background liver regions.

Results: The NLLS method indicated that k3(p = 0.001) and fa (p < 0.001) were higher in HCCs than in background liver tissue, while K1(p = 0.603), k2(p = 0.405), k4(p = 0.492), Vb(p = 0.112), and Ki(p = 0.091) were not significantly different. The Bayesian method showed that k3(p < 0.001), fa (p < 0.001), and Ki(p = 0.002) were higher in HCCs than in background liver tissue, while K1(p = 0.195), k2(p = 0.028), k4(p = 0.723), and Vb(p = 0.018) were not significantly different. For k3and fa, the Bayesian method showed a higher AUC value for diagnostic performance in differentiating HCCs from background liver tissue than the NLLS method (0.853 vs. 0.745 and 0.928 vs. 0.886). Additionally, the Bayesian method had smaller Akaike information criteria and residual sum of squares values, as well as fewer parameter estimation outliers, than the NLLS method.

Conclusions: The proposed Bayesian method can accurately and robustly estimate liver kinetic parameters, effectively distinguish between lesions and background liver tissue, and provide accurate information about the uncertainty in parameter estimation.

TITLE: A Generalized Linear modeling approach to bootstrapping multi-frame PET image data

AUTHORS: Finbarr O'Sullivan, Fengyun Gu, Qi Wu, Liam D O'Suilleabhain

JOURNAL: Medical image analysis

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
PET imaging is an important diagnostic tool for management of patients with cancer and other diseases. Medical decisions based on quantitative PET information could potentially benefit from the availability of tools for evaluation of associated uncertainties. Raw PET data can be viewed as a sample from an inhomogeneous Poisson process so there is the possibility to directly apply bootstrapping to raw projection-domain list-mode data. Unfortunately this is computationally impractical, particularly if data reconstruction is iterative or the acquisition protocol is dynamic. We develop a flexible statistical linear model analysis to be used with multi-frame PET image data to create valid bootstrap samples. The technique is illustrated using data from dynamic PET studies with fluoro-deoxyglucose (FDG) and fluoro-thymidine (FLT) in brain and breast cancer patients. As is often the case with dynamic PET studies, data have been archived without raw list-mode information. Using the bootstrapping technique maps of kinetic parameters and associated uncertainties are obtained. The quantitative performance of the approach is assessed by simulation. The proposed image-domain bootstrap is found to substantially match the projection-domain alternative. Analysis of results points to a close relation between relative uncertainty in voxel-level kinetic parameters and local reconstruction error. This is consistent with statistical theory.

AUTHORS: Hongyan Yin, Guobing Liu, Yan Hu, Jie Xiao, Wujian Mao, Jing Lv, Haojun Yu, Qingyu Lin, Dengfeng Cheng, Hongcheng Shi

JOURNAL: Contrast media & molecular imaging

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Objective: To investigate the biodistribution and kinetic constants of68Ga-DOTATATE in normal organs through dynamic total-body positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT).

Methods: Seven patients who experienced endoscopic resection of gastric neuroendocrine tumor were enrolled. Dynamic total-body PET/CT scans over 60 min were performed. Time-activity curves were obtained by drawing regions of interest in normal organs. Rate constants, includingK1,k2,k3, and vB, were computed using a two-tissue compartment model. Factor analysis was used to compare the rate constants among subjects and regions. Hierarchical cluster analysis was performed to identify organs with similar kinetic characteristics.

Results: The highest uptake of68Ga-DOTATATE was observed in the spleen followed by kidneys, adrenals, liver, pituitary gland, pancreas head, prostate, pancreas body, and thyroid, parotid, and submandibular glands. Low background level of68Ga-DOTATATE uptake was observed in the nasal mucosa, bone, blood pool, and cerebrum. In addition, the uptake in the pancreas head was noted to be higher than the pancreas body (P< 0.001) on the basis of each time point of dynamic PET. There were differences of rate constants among different organs. The meanK1ranged from 0.0507 min-1in the left nasal mucosa to 1.21 min-1in the left kidney, and meank2ranged from 0.0174 min-1in the spleen to 4.4487 min-1in the left cerebrum. The meank3ranged from 0.0563 min-1in the right cerebrum to 4.6309 min-1in the left adrenal, and mean vB ranged from 0.0001 in the left cerebrum to 0.2489 in the right adrenal. However, none of the rate constants was significantly different among subjects or among different sites within a single organ. Three groups of organs with similar kinetic characteristics were identified: (1) cerebrum; (2) pituitary gland, liver, adrenal, and prostate; and (3) nasal mucosa, parotid and submandibular glands, thyroid, spleen, pancreas, kidney, and bone.

Conclusion: Uptake and clearance of68Ga-DOTATATE, in terms of kinetic constants, were different in different organs. The kinetic parameters of68Ga-DOTATATE in different organs provide a reference for future dynamic PET imaging.

TITLE: Effects of dynamic [18F]NaF PET scan duration on kinetic uptake parameters in the knee

AUTHORS: Lauren E Watkins, Bryan Haddock, Ananya Goyal, Feliks Kogan

JOURNAL: Frontiers in nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Introduction: Accurately estimating bone perfusion and metabolism using [18F]NaF kinetics from shorter scan times could help address concerns related to patient comfort, motion, and throughput for PET scans. We examined the impact of changing the PET scan duration on the accuracy of [18F]NaF kinetic parameters in the knee.

Methods: Both knees of twenty participants with and without osteoarthritis were scanned using a hybrid PET-MRI system (53 ± 13 years, BMI 25.9 ± 4.2 kg/m2, 13 female). Seventeen participants were scanned for 54 ± 2 min, and an additional three participants were scanned for 75 min. PatlakKiand Hawkins kinetic parameters (Ki,K1, extraction fraction) were assessed using 50- or 75-minutes of scan data as well as for scan durations that were retrospectively shortened. The error of the kinetic uptake parameters was calculated in bone regions throughout the knee.

Results: The mean error of PatlakKi, HawkinsKi,K1, and extraction fraction was less than 10% for scan durations exceeding 30 min and decreased with increasing scan duration.

Conclusions: The length of dynamic data acquisition can be reduced to as short as 30 min while retaining accuracy within the limits of reproducibility of Hawkins kinetic uptake parameters.

Neo-vascularization is a potential target to image tumor microenvironment, as it defines its brain invasion. We investigate [18F]rhPSMA-7.3 with PET/MRI for quantitative imaging of neo-vascularization in GBM bearing mice and human tumor tissue and compare it to [18F]FET and [18F]fluciclovine using PET pharmacokinetic modeling (PKM).

Methods: [18F]rhPSMA-7.3, [18F]FET, and [18F]fluciclovine were i.v. injected with 10.5 ± 3.1 MBq, 8.0 ± 2.2 MBq, 11.5 ± 1.9 MBq (n = 28, GL261-luc2) and up to 90 min PET/MR imaged 21/28 days after surgery. Regions of interest were delineated on T2-weighted MRI for (i) tumor, (ii) brain, and (iii) the inferior vena cava. Time-activity curves were expressed as SUV mean, SUVR and PKM performed using 1-/2-tissue-compartment models (1TCM, 2TCM), Patlak and Logan analysis (LA). Immunofluorescent staining (IFS), western blotting, and autoradiography of tumor tissue were performed for result validation.

Results: [18F]rhPSMA-7.3 showed a tumor uptake with a tumor-to-background-ratio (TBR) = 2.1-2.5, in 15-60 min. PKM (2TCM) confirmed higher K1 (0.34/0.08, p = 0.0012) and volume of distribution VT(0.24/0.1, p = 0.0017) in the tumor region compared to the brain. Linearity in LA and similar k3 = 0.6 and k4 = 0.47 (2TCM, tumor, p = ns) indicated reversible binding. K1, an indicator for vascularization, increased (0.1/0.34, 21 to 28 days, p < 0.005). IFS confirmed co-expression of PSMA and tumor vascularization. [18F]fluciclovine showed higher TBR (2.5/1.8, p < 0.001, 60 min) and VS(1.3/0.7, p < 0.05, tumor) compared to [18F]FET and LA indicated reversible binding. VTincreased (p < 0.001, tumor, 21 to 28 days) for [18F]FET (0.5-1.4) and [18F]fluciclovine (0.84-1.5).

Conclusion: [18F]rhPSMA-7.3 showed to be a potential candidate to investigate the tumor microenvironment of GBM. Following PKM, this uptake was associated with tumor vascularization. In contrast to what is known from PSMA-PET in prostate cancer, reversible binding was found for [18F]rhPSMA-7.3 in GBM, contradicting cellular trapping. Finally, [18F]fluciclovine was superior to [18F]FET rendering it more suitable for PET imaging of GBM.

TITLE: Enzymatic degradation of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET): Identifying the cause of the hypersensitive enzyme kinetic response to increased PET crystallinity

AUTHORS: Thore Bach Thomsen, Tobias S Radmer, Anne S Meyer

JOURNAL: Enzyme and microbial technology

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Plastic pollution poses a significant environmental challenge, with poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) being a major contributor due to its extensive use in single use applications such as plastic bottles and other packaging material. Enzymatic degradation of PET offers a promising solution for PET recycling, but the enzyme kinetics in relation to the degree of crystallinity (XC) of the PET substrate are poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the hypersensitive enzyme kinetic response on PET at XCfrom ∼8.5-12% at 50 °C using the benchmark PET hydrolysing enzyme LCCICCG. We observed a substantial reduction in the maximal enzymatic reaction rate (invVmax) with increasing XC, corresponding to a 3-fold reduction ininvVmaxwhen the XCof PET increased from 8.6% to 12.2%. The kinetic analysis revealed that the level of the Mobile Amorphous Fraction (XMAF) was a better descriptor for the enzymatic degradation rate response than XC (or (100%-XC)). By continuous monitoring of the enzymatic reaction progress, we quantified the lag phase prolongation in addition to the steady-state kinetic rates (vss) of the reactions and found that the duration of the lag phase of a reaction could be predicted from the vssand XCby multiple linear regression modeling. The linear correlation between the duration of the lag phase and the vssof the enzymatic PET degradation affirmed that the LCCICCGworked via a random/endo-type enzymatic attack pattern. The longer lag phase at increased XCof PET is proposed to be due to increased substrate entanglement density as well as unproductive enzyme binding to the crystalline regions of PET. The findings enhance our understanding of PET enzymatic degradation kinetics and its dependence on substrate composition, i.e., XMAFand XC.

JOURNAL: Nuklearmedizin. Nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Tracer kinetic modelling based on dynamic PET is an important field of Nuclear Medicine for quantitative functional imaging. Yet, its implementation in clinical routine has been constrained by its complexity and computational costs. Machine learning poses an opportunity to improve modelling processes in terms of arterial input function prediction, the prediction of kinetic modelling parameters and model selection in both clinical and preclinical studies while reducing processing time. Moreover, it can help improving kinetic modelling data used in downstream tasks such as tumor detection. In this review, we introduce the basics of tracer kinetic modelling and present a literature review of original works and conference papers using machine learning methods in this field.

TITLE: Total-Body Dynamic Imaging and Kinetic Modeling of [18F]F-AraG in Healthy Individuals and a Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Patient Undergoing Anti-PD-1 Immunotherapy

ABSTRACT:
Immunotherapies, especially checkpoint inhibitors such as anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (anti-PD-1) antibodies, have transformed cancer treatment by enhancing the immune system's capability to target and kill cancer cells. However, predicting immunotherapy response remains challenging.18F-arabinosyl guanine ([18F]F-AraG) is a molecular imaging tracer targeting activated T cells, which may facilitate therapy response assessment by noninvasive quantification of immune cell activity within the tumor microenvironment and elsewhere in the body. The aim of this study was to obtain preliminary data on total-body pharmacokinetics of [18F]F-AraG as a potential quantitative biomarker for immune response evaluation.Methods:The study consisted of 90-min total-body dynamic scans of 4 healthy subjects and 1 non-small cell lung cancer patient who was scanned before and after anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. Compartmental modeling with Akaike information criterion model selection was used to analyze tracer kinetics in various organs. Additionally, 7 subregions of the primary lung tumor and 4 mediastinal lymph nodes were analyzed. Practical identifiability analysis was performed to assess the reliability of kinetic parameter estimation. Correlations of the SUVmean, the tissue-to-blood SUV ratio (SUVR), and the Logan plot slope (KLogan) with the total volume of distribution (VT) were calculated to identify potential surrogates for kinetic modeling.Results:Strong correlations were observed betweenKLoganand SUVR withVT, suggesting that they can be used as promising surrogates forVT, especially in organs with a low blood-volume fraction. Moreover, practical identifiability analysis suggested that dynamic [18F]F-AraG PET scans could potentially be shortened to 60 min, while maintaining quantification accuracy for all organs of interest. The study suggests that although [18F]F-AraG SUV images can provide insights on immune cell distribution, kinetic modeling or graphical analysis methods may be required for accurate quantification of immune response after therapy. Although SUVmeanshowed variable changes in different subregions of the tumor after therapy, the SUVR,KLogan, andVTshowed consistent increasing trends in all analyzed subregions of the tumor with high practical identifiability.Conclusion:Our findings highlight the promise of [18F]F-AraG dynamic imaging as a noninvasive biomarker for quantifying the immune response to immunotherapy in cancer patients. Promising total-body kinetic modeling results also suggest potentially wider applications of the tracer in investigating the role of T cells in the immunopathogenesis of diseases.

TITLE: Input function and modeling for determining bone metabolic flux using [18 F] sodium fluoride PET imaging: A step-by-step guide

AUTHORS: Tanuj Puri, Michelle L Frost, Amelia E B Moore, Gary J R Cook, Glen M Blake

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Studies of skeletal metabolism using measurements of bone metabolic flux (Ki) obtained with [18F] sodium fluoride ([18F]NaF) positron emission tomography (PET) scans have been used in clinical research for the last 30 years. The technique has proven useful as an imaging biomarker in trials of novel drug treatments for osteoporosis and investigating other metabolic bone diseases, including chronic kidney disease mineral and bone disorder. It has also been shown to be valuable in metastatic bone disease in breast cancer patients and may have potential in other cancer types, such as prostate cancer, to assess early bone fracture risk. However, these studies have usually required a 60-min dynamic PET scan and measurement of the arterial input function (AIF), making them difficult to translate into the clinic for diagnostic purposes. We have previously proposed a simplified method that estimates the Kivalue at an imaging site from a short (4-min) static scan and venous blood samples. A key advantage of this method is that, by acquiring a series of static scans, values of Kican be quickly measured at multiple sites using a single injection of the tracer. To date, the widespread use of [18F]NaF PET has been limited by the need to measure the AIF required for the mathematical modeling of tracer kinetics to derive Kiand other kinetic parameters. In this report, we review different methods of measuring the AIF, including direct arterial sampling, the use of a semi-population input function (SP-AIF), and image-derived input function, the latter two requiring only two or three venous blood samples obtained between 30 and 60 min after injection. We provide an SP-AIF model and a spreadsheet for calculating Kivalues using the static scan method that others can use to study bone metabolism in metabolic and metastatic bone diseases without requiring invasive arterial blood sampling. The method shortens scan times, simplifies procedures, and reduces the cost of multicenter trials without losing accuracy or precision.

TITLE: DIFFUSION MODEL-BASED POSTERIOR DISTRIBUTION PREDICTION FOR KINETIC PARAMETER ESTIMATION IN DYNAMIC PET

AUTHORS: Y Djebra, X Liu, T Marin, A Tiss, M Dhaynaut, N Guehl, K Johnson, G El Fakhri, C Ma, J Ouyang

JOURNAL: Proceedings. IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a valuable imaging method for studying molecular-level processes in the body, such as hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau) protein aggregates, a hallmark of several neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease. P-tau density and cerebral perfusion can be quantified from PET data using tracer kinetic modeling techniques. However, noise in PET images leads to uncertainty in the estimated kinetic parameters. This can be quantified in a Bayesian framework by the posterior distribution of kinetic parameters given PET measurements. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques can be employed to estimate the posterior distribution, although with significant computational needs. In this paper, we propose to leverage deep learning inference efficiency to infer the posterior distribution. A novel approach using denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) is introduced. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated on a [18F]MK6240 study and compared to an MCMC method. Our approach offered significant reduction in computation time (over 30 times faster than MCMC) and consistently predicted accurate (< 0.8 % mean error) and precise (< 5.77 % standard deviation error) posterior distributions.

TITLE: Posterior Estimation Using Deep Learning: A Simulation Study of Compartmental Modeling in Dynamic PET

AUTHORS: Xiaofeng Liu, Thibault Marin, Tiss Amal, Jonghye Woo, Georges El Fakhri, Jinsong Ouyang

JOURNAL: ArXiv

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Background: In medical imaging, images are usually treated as deterministic, while their uncertainties are largely underexplored.

Purpose: This work aims at using deep learning to efficiently estimate posterior distributions of imaging parameters, which in turn can be used to derive the most probable parameters as well as their uncertainties.

Methods: Our deep learning-based approaches are based on a variational Bayesian inference framework, which is implemented using two different deep neural networks based on conditional variational auto-encoder (CVAE), CVAE-dual-encoder and CVAE-dual-decoder. The conventional CVAE framework, i.e., CVAE-vanilla, can be regarded as a simplified case of these two neural networks. We applied these approaches to a simulation study of dynamic brain PET imaging using a reference region-based kinetic model.

Results: In the simulation study, we estimated posterior distributions of PET kinetic parameters given a measurement of time-activity curve. Our proposed CVAE-dual-encoder and CVAE-dual-decoder yield results that are in good agreement with the asymptotically unbiased posterior distributions sampled by Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). The CVAE-vanilla can also be used for estimating posterior distributions, although it has an inferior performance to both CVAE-dual-encoder and CVAE-dual-decoder.

Conclusions: We have evaluated the performance of our deep learning approaches for estimating posterior distributions in dynamic brain PET. Our deep learning approaches yield posterior distributions, which are in good agreement with unbiased distributions estimated by MCMC. All these neural networks have different characteristics and can be chosen by the user for specific applications. The proposed methods are general and can be adapted to other problems.

Examples of the model types discussed in part I are reviewed here: a 1-tissue-compartment model (15O-water), an irreversible 2-tissue-compartment model (18F-FDG), and a reversible 2-tissue-compartment model (3'-deoxy-3'-18F-fluorothymidine). Kinetic approaches are contrasted with static uptake measures typically used in the clinic. Overall, this 2-part review provides the reader with background in kinetic analysis to understand related research and improve the interpretation of clinical nuclear medicine studies with a focus on oncologic imaging.

JOURNAL: Metabolites

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Accurate positron emission tomography (PET) data quantification relies on high-quality input plasma curves, but venous blood sampling may yield poor-quality data, jeopardizing modeling outcomes. In this study, we aimed to recover sub-optimal input functions by using information from the tail (5th-100th min) of curves obtained through the frequent sampling protocol and an input recovery (IR) model trained with reference curves of optimal shape. Initially, we included 170 plasma input curves from eight published studies with clamp [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose PET exams. Model validation involved 78 brain PET studies for which compartmental model (CM) analysis was feasible (reference (ref) + training sets). Recovered curves were compared with original curves using area under curve (AUC), max peak standardized uptake value (maxSUV). CM parameters (ref + training sets) and fractional uptake rate (FUR) (all sets) were computed. Original and recovered curves from the ref set had comparable AUC (d = 0.02, not significant (NS)), maxSUV (d = 0.05, NS) and comparable brain CM results (NS). Recovered curves from the training set were different from the original according to maxSUV (d = 3) and biologically plausible according to the max theoretical K1 (53//56). Brain CM results were different in the training set (p< 0.05 for all CM parameters and brain regions) but not in the ref set. FUR showed reductions similarly in the recovered curves of the training and test sets compared to the original curves (p< 0.05 for all regions for both sets). The IR method successfully recovered the plasma inputs of poor quality, rescuing cases otherwise excluded from the kinetic modeling results. The validation approach proved useful and can be applied to different tracers and metabolic conditions.

TITLE: Kinetic Modeling and Parametric Imaging of 13N-NH3 in Treatment-Naïve Lung Cancer

AUTHORS: Hui Yuan, Fanghu Wang, Yang Chen, Xiaoqiang Pan, Qing Zhang, Tao Sun, Lei Jiang

JOURNAL: Molecular pharmaceutics

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
13N-NH3PET imaging provides insights into tumor perfusion and metabolism, hence potentially valuable in oncological diagnosis, staging, and prognosis. However, itsin vivokinetic characteristics and the optimal protocol for kinetic modeling and parametric imaging remain unclear. This study aims to elucidate the kinetic features of13N-NH3in lung cancer and its clinical value. Nine lung cancer surgical candidates were prospectively incorporated. Using total-body PET/CT scanner, 35 min13N-NH3acquisitions were conducted immediately postinjection. Subsequently, routine 5 min18F-FDG acquisitions were made.13N-NH3PET data were reconstructed into dynamic image series. Tumor lesions and normal organs were segmented using nonthreshold dependent automatic or semiautomatic tools. Reversible and irreversible 2-tissue compartment models (2TC vs 2TiC) using image-derived input functions (IDIFs) with population-based metabolite correction were adopted for parametric modeling. Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) was calculated for model selection. Parametric images were produced with the optimal model for lesions. A total of 9 patients presented with 9 primary lung tumors and 17 histologically confirmed lymphadenopathy. All primary lung tumors and regional lymph node metastases were detectable using both13N-NH3and18F-FDG imaging. Primary lung tumors, regional lymphadenopathy, and lung backgrounds demonstrated smaller AIC using 2TC models with pulmonary artery as IDIF, while other organs favored either 2TC or 2TiC models with the descending aorta as IDIF. Lesion-to-background lung ratios reached around 2.218-3.407 for primary lung tumors and 1.932-2.537 for regional lymphadenopathy 10-20 min postinjection of13N-NH3. Vt images derived from 2TC modeling showed better lesion-to-background lung ratios (4.511 ± 2.955 for primary tumor, and 2.991 ± 2.152 for regional lymphadenopathy). For13N-NH3imaging in lung cancer, a static image can be acquired at 10-20 min postinjection for clinical diagnosis. The reversible 2TC model is preferred over 2TiC, and the Vt image is preferred over other parametric images in terms of lesion contrast.

TITLE: Optimization and Kinetic Evaluation for Glycolytic Depolymerization of Post-Consumer PET Waste with Sodium Methoxide

AUTHORS: Saqib Javed, Jonas Fisse, Dieter Vogt

JOURNAL: Polymers

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Glycolysis of post-consumer polyethylene terephthalate (PET) waste is a promising chemical recycling technique, back to the monomer, bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET). This work presents sodium methoxide (MeONa) as a low-cost catalyst for this purpose. BHET product was confirmed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCMS), Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy, melting point, and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). It was shown, not surprisingly, that PET conversion increases with the glycolysis temperature. At a fixed temperature of 190 °C, the response surface methodology (RSM) based on the Box-Behnken design was applied. Four independent factors, namely the molar ratio of PET: MeONa (50-150), the molar ratio of ethylene glycol to PET (EG: PET) (3-7), the reaction time (2-6 h), and the particle size (0.25-1 mm) were studied. Based on the experimental results, regression models as a function of significant process factors were obtained and evaluated by analysis of variance (ANOVA), to predict the depolymerization performance of MeONa in terms of PET conversion. Coefficient of determination, R2of 95% indicated the adequacy for predicted model. Afterward, the regression model was validated and optimized within the design space with a prediction of 87% PET conversion at the optimum conditions demonstrating a deviation of less than 5% from predicted response. A van 't Hoff plot confirmed the endothermic nature of the depolymerization reaction. The ceiling temperature (= 160 °C) was calculated from Gibbs' free energy. A kinetic study for the depolymerization reaction was performed and the activation energy for MeONa was estimated from the Arrhenius plot (= 130 kJ/mol). The catalytic depolymerization efficiency of MeONa was compared under similar conditions with widely studied zinc acetate and cobalt acetate. This study shows that MeONa's performance, as a glycolysis catalyst is promising; in addition, it is much cheaper and environmentally more benign than heavy metal salts. These findings make a valuable contribution towards the chemical recycling of post-consumer PET waste to meet future recycling demands of a circular economy.

TITLE: Will extended field-of-view PET/CT depopulate the graveyard of failed PET radiopharmaceuticals?

AUTHORS: E F J de Vries, P H Elsinga, C Tsoumpas

JOURNAL: Cancer imaging : the official publication of the International Cancer Imaging Society

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
With the rapid emergence of extended Field-of-View PET-cameras several new applications for radiopharmaceuticals become within reach. Main reason is the significant increase of the sensitivity of the PET-camera so that much less radioactivity can be administered. Issues that that hampered development or use of PET-radiopharmaceuticals become realistic again. Molar activity requirements can become less strict. New low-yielding radiochemistry methods may become applicable. Carbon-11 labelled compounds can revive and potentially be shipped to nearby PET-facilities. PET-radiopharmaceuticals with slow kinetics in comparison to their half life can still be used. As additional infrastructure and equipment will likely remain unchanged and keep the same sensitivity therefore there will be issues with kinetic modelling requiring analysis of plasma or metabolites samples with lower count rate. Besides the potential revival of failed radiopharmaceuticals, novel challenges are ahead to develop novel radiochemistry based on thus far unsuitable (low yielding or time consuming) reactions.

TITLE: Exact parameter identification in PET pharmacokinetic modeling using the irreversible two tissue compartment model

AUTHORS: Martin Holler, Erion Morina, Georg Schramm

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Objective.In quantitative dynamic positron emission tomography (PET), time series of images, reflecting the tissue response to the arterial tracer supply, are reconstructed. This response is described by kinetic parameters, which are commonly determined on basis of the tracer concentration in tissue and the arterial input function. In clinical routine the latter is estimated by arterial blood sampling and analysis, which is a challenging process and thus, attempted to be derived directly from reconstructed PET images. However, a mathematical analysis about the necessity of measurements of the common arterial whole blood activity concentration, and the concentration of free non-metabolized tracer in the arterial plasma, for a successful kinetic parameter identification does not exist. Here we aim to address this problem mathematically.Approach.We consider the identification problem in simultaneous pharmacokinetic modeling of multiple regions of interests of dynamic PET data using the irreversible two-tissue compartment model analytically. In addition to this consideration, the situation of noisy measurements is addressed using Tikhonov regularization. Furthermore, numerical simulations with a regularization approach are carried out to illustrate the analytical results in a synthetic application example.Main results.We provide mathematical proofs showing that, under reasonable assumptions, all metabolic tissue parameters can be uniquely identified without requiring additional blood samples to measure the arterial input function. A connection to noisy measurement data is made via a consistency result, showing that exact reconstruction of the ground-truth tissue parameters is stably maintained in the vanishing noise limit. Furthermore, our numerical experiments suggest that an approximate reconstruction of kinetic parameters according to our analytic results is also possible in practice for moderate noise levels.Significance.The analytical result, which holds in the idealized, noiseless scenario, suggests that for irreversible tracers, fully quantitative dynamic PET imaging is in principle possible without costly arterial blood sampling and metabolite analysis.

By engineering a radiotracer to target specific biologic processes of relevance to cancer (e.g., cancer metabolism, blood flow, proliferation, and tumor receptor expression or ligand binding), PET can detect cancer spread, characterize the cancer phenotype, and assess its response to treatment. For example, imaging of glucose metabolism using the radiolabeled glucose analog18F-FDG has widespread applications to all 3 of these tasks and plays an important role in cancer care. However, the current clinical practice of imaging at a single time point remote from tracer injection (i.e., static imaging) does not use all the information that PET cancer imaging can provide, especially to address questions beyond cancer detection. Reliance on tracer measures obtained only from static imaging may also lead to misleading results. In this 2-part continuing education paper, we describe the principles of tracer kinetic analysis for oncologic PET (part 1), followed by examples of specific implementations of kinetic analysis for cancer PET imaging that highlight the added benefits over static imaging (part 2). This review is designed to introduce nuclear medicine clinicians to basic concepts of kinetic analysis in oncologic imaging, with a goal of illustrating how kinetic analysis can augment our understanding of in vivo cancer biology, improve our approach to clinical decision making, and guide the interpretation of quantitative measures derived from static images.

TITLE: Evaluation of quantitative modeling methods in whole-body, dynamic [11C]-erlotinib PET

AUTHORS: Joseph Ryan Petrulli, Mingqiang Zheng, Yiyun Huang, Nabeel B Nabulsi, Sarah B Goldberg, Joseph N Contessa, Evan D Morris

JOURNAL: American journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Background: [11C]-Erlotinib is a radiolabeled analogue of a tyrosine kinase inhibitor used to treat non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) which expresses specific kinase domain mutations of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). In this study, 10 subjects with NSCLC and assorted EGFR mutation status underwent a dynamic, multi-bed positron emission tomography (PET) scan using [11C]-erlotinib. Data were analyzed using a variety of quantitative techniques common in PET (graphical methods, kinetic models, and uptake value-based endpoints). Our primary goal was to determine the most reliable imaging endpoint given the need for maintaining minimal patient burden and recognizing the advantage of simple calculations in future trials.

Results: Standard uptake values (a semi-quantitative endpoint) were well correlated with both binding potential and volume of distribution (fully quantitative endpoints). Normalized tracer uptake was found to stabilize approximately 60 minutes post tracer injection.Conclusions: The kinetic properties of [11C]-erlotinib varied greatly across subjects. Our novel scanning protocol produced an important dataset which highlights the great heterogeneity of NSCLC and its apparent impact on [11C]-erlotinib kinetics. A lack of correlation between EGFR mutational status and quantitative endpoints appears to be due to disease heterogeneity and low tracer uptake. The most reliable fits of the dynamic data were based on the one-tissue compartmental model which were well correlated with mean SUV. Due to this correlation and good stability at late-time, SUV seems sufficiently well-suited to quantitative imaging of NSCLC lesions in the whole body with [11C]-erlotinib.

TITLE: Modeling venous plasma samples in [18F] FDG PET studies: a nonlinear mixed-effects approach

ABSTRACT:
The gold-standard approach to quantifying dynamic PET images relies on using invasive measures of the arterial plasma tracer concentration. An attractive alternative is to employ an image-derived input function (IDIF), corrected for spillover effects and rescaled with venous plasma samples. However, venous samples are not always available for every participant. In this work, we used the nonlinear mixed-effects modeling approach to develop a model which infers venous tracer kinetics by using venous samples obtained from a population of healthy individuals and integrating subject-specific covariates. Population parameters (fixed effects), their between-subject variability (random effects), and the effects of covariates were estimated. The selected model will allow to reliably infer venous tracer kinetics in subjects with missing measurements. Clinical relevance - The derived model will be relevant for fully noninvasive dynamic FDG PET quantification using image-derived input functions in both healthy and patient populations when hemodynamics is not impaired.

TITLE: Advances and challenges in immunoPET methodology

AUTHORS: Philipp Mohr, Joyce van Sluis, Marjolijn N Lub-de Hooge, Adriaan A Lammertsma, Adrienne H Brouwers, Charalampos Tsoumpas

JOURNAL: Frontiers in nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Immuno-positron emission tomography (immunoPET) enables imaging of specific targets that play a role in targeted therapy and immunotherapy, such as antigens on cell membranes, targets in the disease microenvironment, or immune cells. The most common immunoPET applications use a monoclonal antibody labeled with a relatively long-lived positron emitter such as89Zr (T1/2= 78.4 h), but smaller antibody-based constructs labeled with various other positron emitting radionuclides are also being investigated. This molecular imaging technique can thus guide the development of new drugs and may have a pivotal role in selecting patients for a particular therapy. In early phase immunoPET trials, multiple imaging time points are used to examine the time-dependent biodistribution and to determine the optimal imaging time point, which may be several days after tracer injection due to the slow kinetics of larger molecules. Once this has been established, usually only one static scan is performed and semi-quantitative values are reported. However, total PET uptake of a tracer is the sum of specific and nonspecific uptake. In addition, uptake may be affected by other factors such as perfusion, pre-/co-administration of the unlabeled molecule, and the treatment schedule. This article reviews imaging methodologies used in immunoPET studies and is divided into two parts. The first part summarizes the vast majority of clinical immunoPET studies applying semi-quantitative methodologies. The second part focuses on a handful of studies applying pharmacokinetic models and includes preclinical and simulation studies. Finally, the potential and challenges of immunoPET quantification methodologies are discussed within the context of the recent technological advancements provided by long axial field of view PET/CT scanners.

ABSTRACT:
Introduction: Quantitative positron emission tomography (PET) studies of neurodegenerative diseases typically require the measurement of arterial input functions (AIF), an invasive and risky procedure. This study aims to assess the reproducibility of [11C]DPA-713 PET kinetic analysis using population-based input function (PBIF). The final goal is to possibly eliminate the need for AIF.

Materials and methods: Eighteen subjects including six healthy volunteers (HV) and twelve Parkinson disease (PD) subjects from two [11C]-DPA-713 PET studies were included. Each subject underwent 90 min of dynamic PET imaging. Five healthy volunteers underwent a test-retest scan within the same day to assess the repeatability of the kinetic parameters. Kinetic modeling was carried out using the Logan total volume of distribution (VT) model. For each data set, kinetic analysis was performed using a patient-specific AIF (PSAIF, ground-truth standard) and then repeated using the PBIF. PBIF was generated using the leave-one-out method for each subject from the remaining 17 subjects and after normalizing the PSAIFs by 3 techniques: (a) Weightsubject×DoseInjected, (b) area under AIF curve (AUC), and (c) Weightsubject×AUC. The variability in the VTmeasured with PSAIF, in the test-retest study, was determined for selected brain regions (white matter, cerebellum, thalamus, caudate, putamen, pallidum, brainstem, hippocampus, and amygdala) using the Bland-Altman analysis and for each of the 3 normalization techniques. Similarly, for all subjects, the variabilities due to the use of PBIF were assessed.

Results: Bland-Altman analysis showed systematic bias between test and retest studies. The corresponding mean bias and 95% limits of agreement (LOA) for the studied brain regions were 30% and ± 70%. Comparing PBIF- and PSAIF-based VTestimate for all subjects and all brain regions, a significant difference between the results generated by the three normalization techniques existed for all brain structures except for the brainstem (P-value = 0.095). The mean % difference and 95% LOA is -10% and ±45% for Weightsubject×DoseInjected; +8% and ±50% for AUC; and +2% and ± 38% for Weightsubject×AUC. In all cases, normalizing by Weightsubject×AUC yielded the smallest % bias and variability (% bias = ±2%; LOA = ±38% for all brain regions). Estimating the reproducibility of PBIF-kinetics to PSAIF based on disease groups (HV/PD) and genotype (MAB/HAB), the average VTvalues for all regions obtained from PBIF is insignificantly higher than PSAIF (%difference = 4.53%, P-value = 0.73 for HAB; and %difference = 0.73%, P-value = 0.96 for MAB). PBIF also tends to overestimate the difference between PD and HV for HAB (% difference = 32.33% versus 13.28%) and underestimate it in MAB (%difference = 6.84% versus 20.92%).

Conclusions: PSAIF kinetic results are reproducible with PBIF, with variability in VTwithin that obtained for the test-retest studies. Therefore, VTassessed using PBIF-based kinetic modeling is clinically feasible and can be an alternative to PSAIF.

TITLE: Patient-Adaptive Population-Based Modeling of Arterial Input Functions

AUTHORS: Zhaoyan Xiu, Mark Muzi, Jian Huang, Eric Wolsztynski

JOURNAL: IEEE transactions on medical imaging

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Kinetic modeling of dynamic PET data requires knowledge of tracer concentration in blood plasma, described by the arterial input function (AIF). Arterial blood sampling is the gold standard for AIF measurement, but is invasive and labour intensive. A number of methods have been proposed to accurately estimate the AIF directly from blood sampling and/or imaging data. Here we consider fitting a patient-adaptive mixture of historical population time course profiles to estimate individual AIFs. Travel time of a tracer atom from the injection site to the right ventricle of the heart is modeled as a realization from a Gamma distribution, and the time this atom spends in circulation before being sampled is represented by a subject-specific linear mixture of population profiles. These functions are estimated from independent population data. Individual AIFs are obtained by projection onto this basis of population profile components. The model incorporates knowledge of injection duration into the fit, allowing for varying injection protocols. Analyses of arterial sampling data from 18F-FDG, 15O-H2O and 18F-FLT clinical studies show that the proposed model can outperform reference techniques. The statistically significant gain achieved by using population data to train the basis components, instead of fitting these from the single individual sampling data, is measured on the FDG cohort. Kinetic analyses of simulated data demonstrate the reliability and potential benefit of this approach in estimating physiological parameters. These results are further supported by numerical simulations that demonstrate convergence and stability of the proposed technique under varying training population sizes and noise levels.

TITLE: Combining deep learning with a kinetic model to predict dynamic PET images and generate parametric images

AUTHORS: Ganglin Liang, Jinpeng Zhou, Zixiang Chen, Liwen Wan, Xieraili Wumener, Yarong Zhang, Dong Liang, Ying Liang, Zhanli Hu

JOURNAL: EJNMMI physics

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Background: Dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) images are useful in clinical practice because they can be used to calculate the metabolic parameters (Ki) of tissues using graphical methods (such as Patlak plots). Kiis more stable than the standard uptake value and has a good reference value for clinical diagnosis. However, the long scanning time required for obtaining dynamic PET images, usually an hour, makes this method less useful in some ways. There is a tradeoff between the scan durations and the signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of Kiimages. The purpose of our study is to obtain approximately the same image as that produced by scanning for one hour in just half an hour, improving the SNRs of images obtained by scanning for 30 min and reducing the necessary 1-h scanning time for acquiring dynamic PET images.

Methods: In this paper, we use U-Net as a feature extractor to obtain feature vectors with a priori knowledge about the image structure of interest and then utilize a parameter generator to obtain five parameters for a two-tissue, three-compartment model and generate a time activity curve (TAC), which will become close to the original 1-h TAC through training. The above-generated dynamic PET image finally obtains the Kiparameter image.

Results: A quantitative analysis showed that the network-generated Kiparameter maps improved the structural similarity index measure and peak SNR by averages of 2.27% and 7.04%, respectively, and decreased the root mean square error (RMSE) by 16.3% compared to those generated with a scan time of 30 min.

Conclusions: The proposed method is feasible, and satisfactory PET quantification accuracy can be achieved using the proposed deep learning method. Further clinical validation is needed before implementing this approach in routine clinical applications.

TITLE: Quantitation of dynamic total-body PET imaging: recent developments and future perspectives

AUTHORS: Fengyun Gu, Qi Wu

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Background: Positron emission tomography (PET) scanning is an important diagnostic imaging technique used in disease diagnosis, therapy planning, treatment monitoring, and medical research. The standardized uptake value (SUV) obtained at a single time frame has been widely employed in clinical practice. Well beyond this simple static measure, more detailed metabolic information can be recovered from dynamic PET scans, followed by the recovery of arterial input function and application of appropriate tracer kinetic models. Many efforts have been devoted to the development of quantitative techniques over the last couple of decades.

Challenges: The advent of new-generation total-body PET scanners characterized by ultra-high sensitivity and long axial field of view, i.e., uEXPLORER (United Imaging Healthcare), PennPET Explorer (University of Pennsylvania), and Biograph Vision Quadra (Siemens Healthineers), further stimulates valuable inspiration to derive kinetics for multiple organs simultaneously. But some emerging issues also need to be addressed, e.g., the large-scale data size and organ-specific physiology. The direct implementation of classical methods for total-body PET imaging without proper validation may lead to less accurate results.

Conclusions: In this contribution, the published dynamic total-body PET datasets are outlined, and several challenges/opportunities for quantitation of such types of studies are presented. An overview of the basic equation, calculation of input function (based on blood sampling, image, population or mathematical model), and kinetic analysis encompassing parametric (compartmental model, graphical plot and spectral analysis) and non-parametric (B-spline and piece-wise basis elements) approaches is provided. The discussion mainly focuses on the feasibilities, recent developments, and future perspectives of these methodologies for a diverse-tissue environment.

TITLE: Kinetic modeling and parametric imaging of 18 F-PSMA-11: An evaluation based on total-body dynamic positron emission tomography scans

AUTHORS: Hui Yuan, Guojin Zhang, Taotao Sun, Jingyun Ren, Qing Zhang, Zeyin Xiang, Entao Liu, Lei Jiang

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Background: The prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) targeted positron-emitting tomography (PET) tracers are increasingly used in clinical practice, with novel tracers constantly being developed. Recently,18F-PSMA-11 has been gaining growing interest for several merits; however, direct in vivo visualization of its kinetic features in humans remains lacking.

Purpose: To visualize the kinetic features of18F-PSMA-11 in healthy subjects and patients with prostate cancer derived from the total-body dynamic PET scans.

Methods: A total of 8 healthy volunteers (7 males; 1 female) and 3 patients with prostate cancer underwent total-body PET/CT imaging at 1 and 2 h post injection (p.i.) of18F-PSMA-11, of which 7 healthy subjects and 3 patients underwent total-body dynamic PET scans lasting 30 min. Reversible two-tissue compartments (2TC) and Patlak models were fitted based on the voxel-based time activity curves (TACs), with the parametric images generated subsequently. Additionally, semi-automated segmentation of multiple organs was performed in the dynamic images to measure the SUVmean at different time points and in the parametric images to estimate the mean value of the kinetic parameters of these organs.

Results: 18F-PSMA-11 showed quick accumulation within prostate cancer, as early as 45 s after tracer injection. It was rapidly cleared from blood circulation and predominantly excreted through the urinary system. High and rapid radiotracer accumulation was observed in the liver, spleen, lacrimal glands, and salivary glands, whereas gradual accumulation was observed in the skeleton. Prostate cancer tissue is visualized in all parametric images, and best seen in DV and Patlak Ki images. Patlak Ki showed a good correlation with 2TC Kivalues (r = 0.858, p < 0.05) but less noise than 2TC images. A scanning time point of 30-35 min p.i. was then suggested for satisfactory tumor to background ratio.

Conclusion: Prostate cancer tissue is visible in most parametric images, and is better shown by Patlak Ki and 2TC DV images. Patlak Ki is consistent with, and thus is preferred over, 2TC Ki images for substantially quicker calculation. Based on the dynamic imaging analysis, a shorter uptake time (30-35 min) might be preferred for a better balance of tumor to background ratio.

JOURNAL: International journal of molecular sciences

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
PET/CT molecular imaging has been imposed in clinical oncological practice over the past 20 years, driven by its two well-grounded foundations: quantification and radiolabeled molecular probe vectorization. From basic visual interpretation to more sophisticated full kinetic modeling, PET technology provides a unique opportunity to characterize various biological processes with different levels of analysis. In clinical practice, many efforts have been made during the last two decades to standardize image analyses at the international level, but advanced metrics are still under use in practice. In parallel, the integration of PET imaging with radionuclide therapy, also known as radiolabeled theranostics, has paved the way towards highly sensitive radionuclide-based precision medicine, with major breakthroughs emerging in neuroendocrine tumors and prostate cancer. PET imaging of tumor immunity and beyond is also emerging, emphasizing the unique capabilities of PET molecular imaging to constantly adapt to emerging oncological challenges. However, these new horizons face the growing complexity of multidimensional data. In the era of precision medicine, statistical and computer sciences are currently revolutionizing image-based decision making, paving the way for more holistic cancer molecular imaging analyses at the whole-body level.

TITLE: Quantitative Assessment of Myocardial Ischemia With Positron Emission Tomography

JOURNAL: Journal of thoracic imaging

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Recent advances in positron emission tomography (PET) technology and reconstruction techniques have now made quantitative assessment using cardiac PET readily available in most cardiac PET imaging centers. Multiple PET myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) radiopharmaceuticals are available for quantitative examination of myocardial ischemia, with each having distinct convenience and accuracy profile. Important properties of these radiopharmaceuticals ( 15 O-water, 13 N-ammonia, 82 Rb, 11 C-acetate, and 18 F-flurpiridaz) including radionuclide half-life, mean positron range in tissue, and the relationship between kinetic parameters and myocardial blood flow (MBF) are presented. Absolute quantification of MBF requires PET MPI to be performed with protocols that allow the generation of dynamic multiframes of reconstructed data. Using a tissue compartment model, the rate constant that governs the rate of PET MPI radiopharmaceutical extraction from the blood plasma to myocardial tissue is calculated. Then, this rate constant ( K1 ) is converted to MBF using an established extraction formula for each radiopharmaceutical. As most of the modern PET scanners acquire the data only in list mode, techniques of processing the list-mode data into dynamic multiframes are also reviewed. Finally, the impact of modern PET technologies such as PET/CT, PET/MR, total-body PET, machine learning/deep learning on comprehensive and quantitative assessment of myocardial ischemia is briefly described in this review.

TITLE: Low activity [11C]raclopride kinetic modeling in the mouse brain using the spatiotemporal kernel method

AUTHORS: Alan Miranda, Daniele Bertoglio, Sigrid Stroobants, Steven Staelens, Jeroen Verhaeghe

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Depending on the molar activity of the tracer, the maximal allowable injected activity in mouse brain PET studies can be extremely low in order to avoid receptor saturation. Therefore, a high level of noise can be present in the image. We investigate several dynamic PET reconstruction methods in reduced counts, or equivalently in reduced injected activity, data exemplified in [11C]racloprideBPNDandR1quantification using the simplified reference tissue model (SRTM). We compared independent frame reconstruction (IFR), post-reconstruction HYPR denoising (IFR + HYPR), direct reconstruction using the SRTM model (DIR-SRTM), and the spatial (KERS) and spatiotemporal kernel reconstruction (KERST). Additionally, HYPR denoising of the frames used as features for the calculation of the spatial kernel matrix, was investigated (KERS-HYPR and KERST-HYPR).In vivodata of 11 mice, was used to generate list-mode data for five reduced count levels corresponding to reductions by a factor 4, 8, 12, 16 and 32 (equivalently 2.07, 1.04, 0.691, 0.518, and 0.260 MBq). Correlation of regionalBPNDandR1values (reduced versus full counts reconstructions) was high (r > 0.94) for all methods, with KERS-HYPR and KERST-HYPR reaching the highest correlation (r> 0.96). Among methods with regularization, DIR-SRTM showed the largest variability inBPND(Bland-Altman SD from 3.0% to 12%), while IFR showed it forR1(5.1%-14.6%). KERST and KERST-HYPR were the only methods with Bland-Altman bias and SD below 5% for noise level up to a reduction factor of 16. At the voxel level,BPNDandR1correlation was gradually decreased with increasing noise, with the largest correlation (BPNDr> 0.88,R1r> 0.62) for KERS-HYPR and KERST-HYPR. The spatial and the spatiotemporal kernel methods performed similarly, while using only temporal regularization with direct reconstruction showed more variability. AlthoughR1 values present noise, using the spatiotemporal kernel reconstruction, accurate estimates of binding potential could be obtained with mouse injected activities as low as 0.26-0.518 MBq. This is desirable in order to maintain the tracer kinetics principle in mouse studies.

AUTHORS: Kelly Smart, Ming-Qiang Zheng, Daniel Holden, Zachary Felchner, Li Zhang, Yanjiang Han, Jim Ropchan, Richard E Carson, Neil Vasdev, Yiyun Huang

JOURNAL: Pharmaceuticals (Basel, Switzerland)

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) is a potential therapeutic target for a range of neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders. The goal of this work was to evaluate two leading GSK-3 positron emission tomography (PET) radioligands, [11C]OCM-44 and [18F]OCM-50, in non-human primates to assess their potential for clinical translation. A total of nine PET scans were performed with the two radiotracers using arterial blood sampling in adult rhesus macaques. Brain regional time-activity curves were extracted and fitted with one- and two-tissue compartment models using metabolite-corrected arterial input functions. Target selectivity was assessed after pre-administration of the GSK-3 inhibitor PF-04802367 (PF-367, 0.03-0.25 mg/kg). Both radiotracers showed good brain uptake and distribution throughout grey matter. [11C]OCM-44 had a free fraction in the plasma of 3% at baseline and was metabolized quickly. The [11C]OCM-44 volume of distribution (VT) values in the brain increased with time;VTvalues from models fitted to truncated 60-min scan data were 1.4-2.9 mL/cm3across brain regions. The plasma free fraction was 0.6% for [18F]OCM-50 andVTvalues (120-min) were 0.39-0.87 mL/cm3in grey matter regions. After correcting for plasma free fraction increases during blocking scans, reductions in regionalVTindicated >80% target occupancy by 0.1 mg/kg of PF-367 for both radiotracers, supporting target selectivity in vivo. [11C]OCM-44 and [18F]OCM-50 warrant further evaluation as radioligands for imaging GSK-3 in the brain, though radio-metabolite accumulation may confound image analysis.

ABSTRACT:
This paper describes pharmacokinetic analyses of the monoamine-oxidase-B (MAO-B) radiotracer [18F](S)-(2-methylpyrid-5-yl)-6-[(3-fluoro-2-hydroxy)propoxy]quinoline ([18F]SMBT-1) for positron emission tomography (PET) brain imaging. Brain MAO-B expression is widespread, predominantly within astrocytes. Reactive astrogliosis in response to neurodegenerative disease pathology is associated with MAO-B overexpression. Fourteen elderly subjects (8 control, 5 mild cognitive impairment, 1 Alzheimer's disease) with amyloid ([11C]PiB) and tau ([18F]flortaucipir) imaging assessments underwent dynamic [18F]SMBT-1 PET imaging with arterial input function determination. [18F]SMBT-1 showed high brain uptake and a retention pattern consistent with the known MAO-B distribution. A two-tissue compartment (2TC) model where the K1/k2ratio was fixed to a whole brain value best described [18F]SMBT-1 kinetics. The 2TC total volume of distribution (VT) was well identified and highly correlated (r2∼0.8) with post-mortem MAO-B indices. Cerebellar grey matter (CGM) showed the lowest mean VTof any region and is considered the optimal pseudo-reference region. Simplified analysis methods including reference tissue models, non-compartmental models, and standard uptake value ratios (SUVR) agreed with 2TC outcomes (r2> 0.9) but with varying bias. We found the CGM-normalized 70-90 min SUVR to be highly correlated (r2= 0.93) with the 2TC distribution volume ratio (DVR) with acceptable bias (∼10%), representing a practical alternative for [18F]SMBT-1 analyses.

JOURNAL: Journal of environmental management

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
This paper briefly reviews the development history of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and the recycling of PET. As one of the most promising way to degrade PET into oligomers and monomers that can be used for the production of high-quality PET, catalytic glycolysis is highlighted in this review. The developments on metal salt, metal oxide and ionic solvent catalysts for glycolysis of PET are systematically summarized, besides, the proposed catalytic mechanisms of ionic liquids (ILs) and deep eutectic solvents (DESs) are presented. The metallic catalysts show high catalytic performance but causing serious environmental pollution and high waste treatment costs, thereby it is proposed that metal-free catalysts, especially ILs and DESs can be the "greener" alternatives to address the PET waste problem. Additionally, the studies related to the glycolysis kinetics are discussed in this review, showing the results that PET glycolysis process consists of heterogeneous and homogeneous depolymerization, and different models should be used to investigate different depolymerization stages in order to obtain a more realistic picture.

ABSTRACT:
The poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) have demonstrated efficacy in ovarian, breast, and prostate cancers, but current biomarkers do not consistently predict clinical benefit.18F-fluorthanatrace (18F-FTT) is an analog to rucaparib, a clinically approved PARPi, and is a candidate biomarker for PARPi response. This study intends to characterize18F-FTT pharmacokinetics in breast cancer and optimize image timing for clinical trials. A secondary aim is to determine whether18F-FTT uptake in breast cancer correlates with matched frozen surgical specimens as a reference standard for PARP-1 protein.Methods:Thirty prospectively enrolled women with a new diagnosis of breast cancer were injected with18F-FTT and imaged dynamically 0-60 min after injection over the chest, with an optional static scan over multiple bed positions starting around 70 min. Kinetic analysis of lesion uptake was performed using blood-pool activity with population radiometabolite corrections. Normal breast and normal muscle reference tissue models were compared with PARP-1 protein expression in 10 patients with available tissue. Plasma radiometabolite concentrations and uptake in tumor and normal muscle were investigated in mouse xenografts.Results:Pharmacokinetics of18F-FTT were well fit by Logan plot reference region models of reversible binding. However, fits of 2-tissue compartment models assuming negligible metabolite uptake were unstable. Rapid metabolism of18F-FTT was demonstrated in mice, and similar uptake of radiometabolites was found in tumor xenografts and normal muscle. Tumor18F-FTT distribution volume ratios relative to normal muscle reference tissue correlated with tissue PARP-1 expression (P< 0.02,n= 10). The tumor-to-normal muscle ratio from a 5-min frame between 50 and 60 min after injection, a potential static scan protocol, closely corresponded to the distribution volume ratio relative to normal muscle and correlated to PARP-1 expression (P< 0.02,n= 10).Conclusion:This study of PARPi analog18F-FTT showed that uptake kinetics in vivo corresponded to expression of PARP-1 and that18F-FTT quantitation is influenced by radiometabolites that are increasingly present late after injection. Radiometabolites can be controlled by using optimal image acquisition timing or normal muscle reference tissue modeling in dynamic imaging or a tumor-to-normal muscle ratio. Optimal image timing for tumor-to-normal muscle quantification in humans appears to be between 50 and 60 min after injection. Therefore, a clinically practical static imaging protocol commencing 45-55 min after injection may sufficiently balance18F-FTT uptake with background clearance and radiometabolite interference for quantitative interpretation of PARP-1 expression in vivo.

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: The α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPA-R) are the primary determinants of synaptic strength in most glutamatergic neurons. Inhibition or negative modulation of AMPA-Rs is an attractive strategy for therapeutic intervention in central nervous system (CNS) disorders characterized by excessive neuronal activity. We report the clinical qualification of a AMPA-R associated TARP-γ8 specific PET ligand [18F]JNJ-64511070 in healthy volunteers including biodistribution, dosimetry and kinetic modelling.

Methods: Whole body dosimetry was performed in 3 healthy male subjects (22-41y). Upon estimation of the normalized cumulated activity (NCA), the effective dose (ED) was calculated using OLINDA v1.1. In a second part, 120-minute dynamic brain scanning with arterial blood sampling was done in five healthy males (25-53y) to determine the appropriate kinetic model and evaluate time stability of total distribution volume (VT). Both 1- and 2-tissue compartment models (1-2TCM) as well as Logan graphical analysis (LGA) were considered to assess regional VT.

Results: The average ED (± SD) was 15.6 ± 1.0 µSv/MBq. Brain uptake of [18F]JNJ-64511070 was fast and showed slow clearance from brain. The intact parent tracer fraction was 80% after 80 min. 2TCM was the most appropriate kinetic model to estimate regional VT, with LGA showing very similar estimates. Regional VTvalues were similar across cortical brain regions (4.49 ± 0.66) with higher values for the hippocampus and amygdala (7.03 ± 1.64 and 5.76 ± 1.10 respectively) and lower values for cerebellum, striatum, thalamus and brain stem (2.82 ± 0.49, 2.84 ± 0.38, 1.12 ± 0.18 and 0.91 ± 0.16 respectively). Inter-subject VTvariability was limited with a Coefficient of Variation (CoV) of 14.5% and 23.3% for cortical and medio-temporal regions respectively. The acquisition time could be reduced to 90 min, while further time reduction induced bias and increased variability in the medial temporal cortex.

Conclusion: [18F]JNJ-64511070 is the first18F-labelled selective PET ligand for quantification of AMPA-R TARP-γ8 expression in human brain and can be used for testing target engagement of AMPA-R TARP-γ8 specific drug compounds, assisting in guiding dose selection and providing insight into the AMPA-R TARP-γ8 expression in healthy and diseased individuals.

TITLE: PET Parametric Imaging: Past, Present, and Future

AUTHORS: Guobao Wang, Arman Rahmim, Roger N Gunn

JOURNAL: IEEE transactions on radiation and plasma medical sciences

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Positron emission tomography (PET) is actively used in a diverse range of applications in oncology, cardiology, and neurology. The use of PET in the clinical setting focuses on static (single time frame) imaging at a specific time-point post radiotracer injection and is typically considered as semi-quantitative; e.g. standardized uptake value (SUV) measures. In contrast, dynamic PET imaging requires increased acquisition times but has the advantage that it measures the full spatiotemporal distribution of a radiotracer and, in combination with tracer kinetic modeling, enables the generation of multiparametric images that more directly quantify underlying biological parameters of interest, such as blood flow, glucose metabolism, and receptor binding. Parametric images have the potential for improved detection and for more accurate and earlier therapeutic response assessment. Parametric imaging with dynamic PET has witnessed extensive research in the past four decades. In this paper, we provide an overview of past and present activities and discuss emerging opportunities in the field of parametric imaging for the future.

TITLE: Efficient PD-L1 imaging of murine glioblastoma with FUS-aided immunoPET by leveraging FcRn-antibody interaction

AUTHORS: Céline Chevaleyre, Anthony Novell, Nicolas Tournier, Ambre Dauba, Steven Dubois, Dimitri Kereselidze, Erwan Selingue, Benoit Jego, Bernard Maillère, Benoit Larrat, Hervé Nozach, Charles Truillet

JOURNAL: Theranostics

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Rationale:The passage of antibodies through the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the blood-tumoral barrier (BTB) is determinant not only to increase the immune checkpoint inhibitors efficacy but also to monitor prognostic and predictive biomarkers such as the programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) via immunoPET. Although the involvement of neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) in antibody distribution has been demonstrated, its function at the BBB remains controversial, while it is unknown at the BTB. In this context, we assessed FcRn's role by pharmacokinetic immunoPET imaging combined with focused ultrasounds (FUS) using unmodified and FcRn low-affinity IgGs targeting PD-L1 in a preclinical orthotopic glioblastoma model.Methods:Transcranial FUS were applied over the whole brain in mice shortly before injecting the anti-PD-L1 IgG89Zr-DFO-C4 or its FcRn low-affinity mutant89Zr-DFO-C4Fc-MUTin a syngeneic glioblastoma murine model (GL261-GFP). Brain uptake was measured from PET scans acquired up to 7 days post-injection. Kinetic modeling was performed to compare the brain kinetics of both C4 formats.Results:FUS efficiently enhanced the delivery of both C4 radioligands in the brain with high reproducibility.89Zr-DFO-C4Fc-MUTmean concentrations in the brain reached a significant uptake of 3.75±0.41%ID/cc with FUS against 1.92±0.45%ID/cc without, at 1h post-injection. A substantial and similar entry of both C4 radioligands was observed at a rate of 0.163±0.071 mL/h/g of tissue during 10.4±4.6min. The impaired interaction with FcRn of89Zr-DFO-C4Fc-MUTsignificantly decreased the efflux constant from the healthy brain tissue to plasma compared with non-mutated IgG. Abolishing FcRn interaction allows determining the target engagement related to the specific binding as soon as 12h post-injection.Conclusion:Abolishing Fc-FcRn interaction confers improved kinetic properties to89Zr-DFO-C4Fc-MUTfor immunoPET imaging. FUS-aided BBB/BTB disruption enables quantitative imaging of PD-L1 expression by glioblastoma tumors within the brain.

TITLE: Assessing the impact of different penalty factors of the Bayesian reconstruction algorithm Q.Clear on in vivo low count kinetic analysis of [11C]PHNO brain PET-MR studies

AUTHORS: Daniela Ribeiro, William Hallett, Oliver Howes, Robert McCutcheon, Matthew M Nour, Adriana A S Tavares

JOURNAL: EJNMMI research

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Introduction: Q.Clear is a Bayesian penalised likelihood (BPL) reconstruction algorithm available on General Electric (GE) Positron Emission Tomography (PET)-Computed Tomography (CT) and PET-Magnetic Resonance (MR) scanners. This algorithm is regulated by a β value which acts as a noise penalisation factor and yields improvements in signal to noise ratio (SNR) in clinical scans, and in contrast recovery and spatial resolution in phantom studies. However, its performance in human brain imaging studies remains to be evaluated in depth. This pilot study aims to investigate the impact of Q.Clear reconstruction methods using different β value versus ordered subset expectation maximization (OSEM) on brain kinetic modelling analysis of low count brain images acquired in the PET-MR.

Methods: Six [11C]PHNO PET-MR brain datasets were reconstructed with Q.Clear with β100-1000 (in increments of 100) and OSEM. The binding potential relative to non-displaceable volume (BPND) were obtained for the Substantia Nigra (SN), Striatum (St), Globus Pallidus (GP), Thalamus (Th), Caudate (Cd) and Putamen (Pt), using the MIAKAT™ software. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), repeatability coefficients (RC), coefficients of variation (CV) and bias from Bland-Altman plots were reported. Statistical analysis was conducted using a 2-way ANOVA model with correction for multiple comparisons.

Results: When comparing a standard OSEM reconstruction of 6 iterations/16 subsets and 5 mm filter with Q.Clear with different β values under low counts, the bias and RC were lower for Q.Clear with β100 for the SN (RC = 2.17), Th (RC = 0.08) and GP (RC = 0.22) and with β200 for the St (RC = 0.14), Cd (RC = 0.18)and Pt (RC = 0.10). The p-values in the 2-way ANOVA model corroborate these findings. ICC values obtained for Th, St, GP, Pt and Cd demonstrate good reliability (0.87, 0.99, 0.96, 0.99 and 0.96, respectively). For the SN, ICC values demonstrate poor reliability (0.43).

Conclusion: BPNDresults obtained from quantitative low count brain PET studies using [11C]PHNO and reconstructed with Q.Clear with β < 400, which is the value used for clinical [18F]FDG whole-body studies, demonstrate the lowest bias versus the typical iterative reconstruction method OSEM.

TITLE: EMATA: a toolbox for the automatic extraction and modeling of arterial inputs for tracer kinetic analysis in [18F]FDG brain studies

AUTHORS: Mattia De Francisci, Erica Silvestri, Andrea Bettinelli, Tommaso Volpi, Manu S Goyal, Andrei G Vlassenko, Diego Cecchin, Alessandra Bertoldo

JOURNAL: EJNMMI physics

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: PET imaging is a pivotal tool for biomarker research aimed at personalized medicine. Leveraging the quantitative nature of PET requires knowledge of plasma radiotracer concentration. Typically, the arterial input function (AIF) is obtained through arterial cannulation, an invasive and technically demanding procedure. A less invasive alternative, especially for [18F]FDG, is the image-derived input function (IDIF), which, however, often requires correction for partial volume effect (PVE), usually performed via venous blood samples. The aim of this paper is to present EMATA: Extraction and Modeling of Arterial inputs for Tracer kinetic Analysis, an open-source MATLAB toolbox. EMATA automates IDIF extraction from [18F]FDG brain PET images and additionally includes a PVE correction procedure that does not require any blood sampling.

Methods: To assess the toolbox generalizability and present example outputs, EMATA was applied to brain [18F]FDG dynamic data of 80 subjects, extracted from two distinct datasets (40 healthy controls, 40 glioma patients). Additionally, to compare with the reference standard, quantification using both IDIF and AIF was carried out on a third open-access dataset of 18 healthy individuals.

Results: EMATA consistently performs IDIF extraction across all datasets, despite differences in scanners and acquisition protocols. Remarkably high agreement is observed when comparing Patlak's Kibetween IDIF and AIF (R2: 0.98 ± 0.02).

Conclusion: EMATA proved adaptability to different datasets characteristics and the ability to provide arterial input functions that can be used for reliable PET quantitative analysis.

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: This first-in-human positron emission tomography (PET) study evaluates [18F]OXD-2314, a radiopharmaceutical designed for imaging tau in non-Alzheimer's disease tauopathies.

Methods: Synthesis of [18F]OXD-2314 was automated using a commercial module and validated for human use. Dynamic PET imaging was performed in healthy control subjects (2 female, 2 male, ages 49-65 years). Kinetic modelling was performed from brain time-activity curves and radiometabolite-corrected arterial input functions to estimate total distribution volumes (VT) in each region of interest.

Results: [18F]OXD-2314 met all release criteria for human use. PET imaging revealed an initial whole brain peak of 2.3 standardized uptake value, followed by a steady washout. Distribution of radioactivity was uniform among brain regions (VTrange: 2.21 ± 0.29 to 2.81 ± 0.43 mL/cm3).

Conclusions: [18F]OXD-2314 was successfully translated to first-in-human PET imaging. No adverse events were reported and PET imaging in patient populations of non-AD tauopathies is underway.

AUTHORS: Jingnan Wang, Yunwen Shao, Bowei Liu, Xuezhu Wang, Barbara Katharina Geist, Xiang Li, Fang Li, Haitao Zhao, Marcus Hacker, Haiyan Ding, Hui Zhang, Li Huo

JOURNAL: BMC medical imaging

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Background: Dynamic PET with kinetic modeling was reported to be potentially helpful in the assessment of hepatic malignancy. In this study, a kinetic modeling analysis was performed on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) from dynamic FDG positron emission tomography/computer tomography (PET/CT) scans.

Methods: A reversible two-tissue compartment model with dual blood input function, which takes into consideration the blood supply from both hepatic artery and portal vein, was used for accurate kinetic modeling of liver dynamic18F-FDG PET imaging. The blood input functions were directly measured as the mean values over the VOIs on descending aorta and portal vein respectively. And the contribution of hepatic artery to the blood input function was optimization-derived in the process of model fitting. The kinetic model was evaluated using dynamic PET data acquired on 24 patients with identified hepatobiliary malignancy. 38 HCC or ICC identified lesions and 24 healthy liver regions were analyzed.

Results: Results showed significant differences in kinetic parameters [Formula: see text], blood supplying fraction [Formula: see text], and metabolic rate constant [Formula: see text] between malignant lesions and healthy liver tissue. And significant differences were also observed in [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] between HCC and ICC lesions. Further investigations of the effect of SUV measurements on the derived kinetic parameters were conducted. And results showed comparable effectiveness of the kinetic modeling using either SUVmean or SUVmax measurements.

Conclusions: Dynamic 18F-FDG PET imaging with optimization-derived hepatic artery blood supply fraction dual-blood input function kinetic modeling can effectively distinguish malignant lesions from healthy liver tissue, as well as HCC and ICC lesions.

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
The poly-(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP) family of proteins participates in numerous functions, most notably the DNA damage response. Cancer vulnerability to DNA damage has led to development of several PARP inhibitors (PARPi). This class of drugs has demonstrated therapeutic efficacy in ovarian, breast, and prostate cancers, but with variable response. Consequently, clinics need to select patients likely to benefit from these targeted therapies. In vivo imaging of18F-fluorthanatrace uptake has been shown to correspond to PARP-1 expression in tissue. This study characterized the pharmacokinetics of18F-fluorthanatrace and tested kinetic and static models to guide metric selection in future studies assessing18F-fluorthanatrace as a biomarker of response to PARPi therapy.Methods:Fourteen prospectively enrolled ovarian cancer patients were injected with18F-fluorthanatrace and imaged dynamically for 60 min after injection followed by up to 2 whole-body scans, with venous blood activity and metabolite measurements. SUVmaxand SUVpeakwere extracted from dynamic images and whole-body scans. Kinetic parameter estimates and SUVs were assessed for correlations with tissue PARP-1 immunofluorescence (n= 7). Simulations of population kinetic parameters enabled estimation of measurement bias and precision in parameter estimates.Results:18F-fluorthanatrace blood clearance was variable, but labeled metabolite profiles were similar across patients, supporting use of a population parent fraction curve. The total distribution volume from a reversible 2-tissue-compartment model and Logan reference tissue distribution volume ratio (DVR) from the first hour of PET acquisition correlated with tumor PARP-1 expression by immunofluorescence (r= 0.76 and 0.83, respectively;P< 0.05). DVR bias and precision estimates were 6.4% and 29.1%, respectively. SUVmaxand SUVpeakacquired from images with midpoints of 57.5, 110 ± 3, and 199 ± 4 min highly correlated with PARP-1 expression (mean ± SD,r≥ 0.79;P< 0.05).Conclusion:Tumor SUVmaxand SUVpeakat 55-60 min after injection and later and DVR from at least 60 min appear to be robust noninvasive measures of PARP-1 binding.18F-fluorthanatrace uptake in ovarian cancer was best described by models of reversible binding. However, pharmacokinetic patterns of tracer uptake were somewhat variable, especially at later time points.

TITLE: Non-invasive quantification of 18F-florbetaben with total-body EXPLORER PET

AUTHORS: Emily N Holy, Elizabeth Li, Anjan Bhattarai, Evan Fletcher, Evelyn R Alfaro, Danielle J Harvey, Benjamin A Spencer, Simon R Cherry, Charles S DeCarli, Audrey P Fan

JOURNAL: Research square

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Kinetic modeling of18F-florbetaben provides important quantification of brain amyloid deposition in research and clinical settings but its use is limited by the requirement of arterial blood data for quantitative PET. The total-body EXPLORER PET scanner supports the dynamic acquisition of a full human body simultaneously and permits noninvasive image-derived input functions (IDIFs) as an alternative to arterial blood sampling. This study quantified brain amyloid burden with kinetic modeling, leveraging dynamic18F-florbetaben PET in aorta IDIFs and the brain in an elderly cohort.

Methods: 18F-florbetaben dynamic PET imaging was performed on the EXPLORER system with tracer injection (300 MBq) in 3 individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD), 3 with mild cognitive impairment, and 9 healthy controls. Image-derived input functions were extracted from the descending aorta with manual regions of interest based on the first 30 seconds after injection. Dynamic time-activity curves (TACs) for 110 minutes were fitted to the two-tissue compartment model (2TCM) using population-based metabolite corrected IDIFs to calculate total and specific distribution volumes (VT, Vs) in key brain regions with early amyloid accumulation. Non-displaceable binding potential (BPND) was also calculated from the multi-reference tissue model (MRTM).

Results: Amyloid-positive (AD) patients showed the highest VTand VSin anterior cingulate, posterior cingulate, and precuneus, consistent withBPNDanalysis.BPNDand VTfrom kinetic models were correlated (r2= 0.46, P<2e-16) with a stronger positive correlation observed in amyloid-positive participants, indicating reliable model fits with the IDIFs. VTfrom 2TCM was highly correlated (r2= 0.65, P< 2e-16) with Logan graphical VTestimation.

Conclusion: Non-invasive quantification of amyloid binding from total-body18F-florbetaben PET data is feasible using aorta IDIFs with high agreement between kinetic distribution volume parameters compared toBPNDin amyloid-positive and negative older individuals.

TITLE: Kinetic 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging of hepatocellular carcinoma: a dual input four-compartment model

AUTHORS: Tao Wang, Yinglei Deng, Sidan Wang, Jianfeng He, Shaobo Wang

JOURNAL: EJNMMI physics

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Background: The endoplasmic reticulum plays an important role in glucose metabolism and has not been explored in the kinetic estimation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) via 18F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose PET/CT.

Methods: A dual-input four-compartment (4C) model, regarding endoplasmic reticulum was preliminarily used for kinetic estimation to differentiate 28 tumours from background liver tissue from 24 patients with HCC. Moreover, parameter images of the 4C model were generated from one patient with negative findings on conventional metabolic PET/CT.

Results: Compared to the dual-input three-compartment (3C) model, the 4C model has better fitting quality, a close transport rate constant (K1) and a dephosphorylation rate constant (k6/k4), and a different removal rate constant (k2) and phosphorylation rate constant (k3) in HCC and background liver tissue. The K1, k2, k3, and hepatic arterial perfusion index (HPI) from the 4C model and k3, HPI, and volume fraction of blood (Vb) from the 3C model were significantly different between HCC and background liver tissues (all P < 0.05). Meanwhile, the 4C model yielded additional kinetic parameters for differentiating HCC. The diagnostic performance of the top ten genes from the most to least common was HPI(4C), Vb(3C), HPI(3C), SUVmax, k5(4C), k3(3C), k2(4C), v(4C), K1(4C) and Vb(4C). Moreover, a patient who showed negative findings on conventional metabolic PET/CT had positive parameter images in the 4C model.

Conclusions: The 4C model with the endoplasmic reticulum performed better than the 3C model and produced additional useful parameters in kinetic estimation for differentiating HCC from background liver tissue.

TITLE: Hepatocellular carcinoma 18F-FDG PET/CT kinetic parameter estimation based on the advantage actor-critic algorithm

AUTHORS: Jianfeng He, Siming Li, Yiwei Xiong, Yu Yao, Siyu Wang, Sidan Wang, Shaobo Wang

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Background: Kinetic parameters estimated with dynamic18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) help characterize hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) can improve kinetic parameter estimation.

Purpose: The advantage actor-critic (A2C) algorithm is a DRL algorithm with neural networks that seek the optimal parameters. The aim of this study was to preliminarily assess the role of the A2C algorithm in estimating the kinetic parameters of18F-FDG PET/CT in patients with HCC.

Materials and methods: 18F-FDG PET data from 14 liver tissues and 17 HCC tumors obtained via a previously developed, abbreviated acquisition protocol (5-min dynamic PET/CT imaging supplemented with 1-min static imaging at 60 min) were prospectively collected. The A2C algorithm was used to estimate kinetic parameters with a reversible double-input, three-compartment model, and the results were compared with those of the conventional nonlinear least squares (NLLS) algorithm. Fitting errors were compared via the root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) of the time activity curves (TACs).

Results: Significant differences in K1, k2, k3, k4, fa, and vbaccording to the A2C algorithm and k3, fa, and vbaccording to the NLLS algorithm were detected between HCC and normal liver tissues (all p < 0.05). Furthermore, A2C demonstrated superior diagnostic performance over NLLS in terms of k3and vb(both p < 0.05 in the Delong test). Notably, A2C yielded a smaller fitting error for normal liver tissue (0.62 ± 0.24 vs. 1.04 ± 1.00) and HCC tissue (1.40 ± 0.42 vs. 1.51 ± 0.97) than did NLLS.

Conclusions: Compared with the conventional postreconstruction NLLS method, the A2C algorithm can more precisely estimate18F-FDG kinetic parameters with a reversible double-input, three-compartment model for HCC tumors, attaining better TAC fitting with a lower RMSE.

TITLE: Noninvasive quantification of [18F]SynVesT-1 binding using simplified reference tissue model 2

AUTHORS: Mika Naganawa, Jean-Dominique Gallezot, Songye Li, Nabeel B Nabulsi, Shannan Henry, Zhengxin Cai, David Matuskey, Yiyun Huang, Richard E Carson

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: [18F]SynVesT-1, a positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer for the synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A), demonstrates kinetics similar to [11C]UCB-J, with high brain uptake, fast kinetics fitting well with the one-tissue compartment (1TC) model, and excellent test-retest reproducibility. Challenges arise due to the similarity between k2and [Formula: see text] (efflux rate of the reference region), when applying the simplified reference tissue model (SRTM) and related methods in [11C]UCB-J studies to accurately estimate [Formula: see text]. This study evaluated the suitability of these methods to estimate [18F]SynVesT-1 binding using centrum semiovale (CS) or cerebellum (CER) as reference regions.

Method: Seven healthy participants underwent 120-min PET scans on the HRRT scanner with [18F]SynVesT-1. Six participants underwent test and retest scans. Arterial blood sampling and metabolite analysis provided input functions for the 1TC model, serving as the gold standard for kinetic parameters values. SRTM, coupled SRTM (SRTMC) and SRTM2 estimated were applied to estimate [Formula: see text](ref: CS) and DVRCER(ref: CER) values. For SRTM2, the population average of [Formula: see text] was determined from the 1TC model applied to the reference region. Test-retest variability and minimum scan time were also calculated.

Results: The 1TC k2(1/min) values for CS and CER were 0.031 ± 0.004 and 0.021 ± 0.002, respectively. Although SRTMC [Formula: see text] was much higher than 1TC [Formula: see text], SRTMC underestimated BPND(ref: CS) and DVRCERby an average of 3% and 1% across regions, respectively, due to similar bias in k2and [Formula: see text] estimation. SRTM underestimated BPND(ref: CS) by an average of 3%, but with the CER as reference region, SRTM estimation was unstable and DVRCERunderestimation varied by region (mean 10%). Using population average [Formula: see text] values, SRTM2 BPNDand DVRCERshowed the best agreement with 1TC estimates.

Conclusion: Our findings support the use of population [Formula: see text] value in SRTM2 with [18F]SynVesT-1 for the estimation of [Formula: see text] or DVRCER, regardless of the choice of reference region.

TITLE: Kinetic Evaluation of the Hypoxia Radiotracers [18F]FMISO and [18F]FAZA in Dogs with Spontaneous Tumors Using Dynamic PET/CT Imaging

AUTHORS: Sangkyung Choen, Michael S Kent, Abhijit J Chaudhari, Simon R Cherry, Ana Krtolica, Allison L Zwingenberger

JOURNAL: Nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: We evaluated the kinetics of the hypoxia PET radiotracers, [18F]fluoromisonidazole ([18F]FMISO) and [18F]fluoroazomycin-arabinoside ([18F]FAZA), for tumor hypoxia detection and to assess the correlation of hypoxic kinetic parameters with static imaging measures in canine spontaneous tumors.

Methods: Sixteen dogs with spontaneous tumors underwent a 150-min dynamic PET scan using either [18F]FMISO or [18F]FAZA. The maximum tumor-to-muscle ratio (TMRmax) > 1.4 on the last image frame was used as the standard threshold to determine tumor hypoxia. The tumor time-activity curves were analyzed using irreversible and reversible two-tissue compartment models and graphical methods. TMRmaxwas compared with radiotracer trapping rate (k3), influx rate (Ki), and distribution volume (VT).

Results: Tumor hypoxia was detected in 7/8 tumors in the [18F]FMISO group and 4/8 tumors in the [18F]FAZA group. All hypoxic tumors were detected at > 120 min with [18F]FMISO and at > 60 min with [18F]FAZA. [18F]FAZA showed better fit with the reversible model. TMRmaxwas strongly correlated with the irreversible parameters (k3andKi) for [18F]FMISO at > 90 min and with the reversible parameter (VT) for [18F]FAZA at > 120 min.

Conclusions: Our results showed that [18F]FAZA provided a promising alternative radiotracer to [18F]FMISO with detecting the presence of tumor hypoxia at an earlier time (60 min), consistent with its favorable faster kinetics. The strong correlation between TMRmaxover the 90-150 min and 120-150 min timeframes with [18F]FMISO and [18F]FAZA, respectively, with kinetic parameters associated with tumor hypoxia for each radiotracer, suggests that a static scan measurement (TMRmax) is a good alternative to quantify tumor hypoxia.

TITLE: PET imaging of functional 5-HT1A receptors with [18F]F13640: From PET kinetics modeling to static Standardized Uptake Values Ratio

AUTHORS: Pierre Courault, Inés Mérida, Nicolas Costes, Jérôme Redoute, Luc Zimmer, Sophie Lancelot

JOURNAL: NeuroImage

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: F13640 is a highly selective serotonin 5-HT1Areceptor ligand with agonist properties identified as a PET radiopharmaceutical candidate. In previous work, we showed the possibility to use long dynamic PET acquisition (225 min) combined with simplified kinetic modelling for [18F]F13640 quantification. In this work, we assessed the feasibility of static acquisition and quantification using standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) as an alternative.

Methods: Test-retest PET-MRI scans of 225 min were conducted in eight healthy male volunteers. For 17 brain regions, distribution volume ratios (DVR) were calculated from the whole kinetics using Logan plot modelling method with the cerebellum white matter as reference region. For the same regions, SUVR were also calculated from static images, for four 20-minute and four 10-minute time-intervals at various time of uptake. Reliability between SUVR and DVR measures were studied, and test-retest parameters were assessed between PET sessions for each time-interval.

Results: Reproducibility of measures of SUVR compared to DVR were excellent, whatever the time interval (p < 0.001). For the 20-min. time-intervals, SUVR150-170showed the best reproducibility and correlation parameters (R2= 0.95 ± 0.03, intercept = 0.06 ± 0.02, slope = 0.95 ± 0.01). As well, for the 10-min. time-intervals, SUVR150-160showed the best correlation (R2= 0.94 ± 0.03, intercept = 0.07 ± 0.02, slope = 0.94 ± 0.01). SUVR reproducibility between test-retest sessions was also excellent for each time-interval. These results were valid for pooled regions as well as at regional level.

Conclusion: This study confirms the feasibility of static acquisitions to facilitate clinical use of the [18F]F13640 radiopharmaceutical to image functional 5-HT1Areceptors. This involves off-camera injection, 10 to 20 mins static acquisition duration, and quantification using SUVR, while improving patient comfort.

TITLE: Evaluation of [18F]F-TZ3108 for PET Imaging of Metabolic-Associated Fatty Liver Disease

AUTHORS: Peiyi Huang, Zhijun Li, Tukang Peng, Jihua Yang, Lei Bi, Guolong Huang, Yifan Qiu, Min Yang, Peizhen Ye, Mingxing Huang, Hongjun Jin, Liao Sun

JOURNAL: Molecular imaging and biology

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Sigma-1 receptor (Sig-1R), a chaperone that resides at the mitochondrion-associated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, is an ER stress biomarker. It is thought that ER stress plays a critical role in the progression of metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD). The aim of this study was to evaluate a positron emission tomography (PET) tracer [18F]F-TZ3108 targeting Sig-1R for MAFLD.

Procedures: The mouse model of MAFLD was established by feeding high-fat diet (HFD) for 12 weeks. Dynamic (0-60 min) PET/CT scans were performed after intravenous injection of 2-deoxy-2[18F]fluoro-D-glucose ([18F]-FDG) and [18F]F-TZ3108. Tracer kinetic modeling was performed for quantification of the PET/CT imaging of the liver. Post-PET biodistribution, the liver tissue western blotting (WB), and immunofluorescence (IF) were performed to compare the expression of Sig-1R levels in the organs harvested from both MAFLD and age-matched control mice.

Results: The micro PET/CT imaging revealed a significantly decreased uptake of [18F]F-TZ3108 in the livers of the MAFLD group compared to the healthy controls, while the uptake of [18F]-FDG in the livers was not significantly different between the two groups. Based on the tracer kinetic modeling, the binding disassociate rate (k4) for [18F]F-TZ3108 was significantly increased in MAFLD group compared to healthy controls. The volume distribution (VT), and the non-displacement binding potential (BPND) revealed significantly decrease in MAFLD compared to healthy controls respectively. The post-PET biodistribution (%ID/g) of [18F]F-TZ3108 in the livers of MAFLD mice was significantly reduced nearly twofold than that in the livers of control mice. WB and IF experiments further confirmed the reduction of Sig-1R expression in the MAFLD group.

Conclusions: The expression of Sig-1R in the liver, measured by the PET tracer, [18F]F-TZ3108, was significantly decreased in mouse model of MAFLD. The [18F]F-TZ3108 PET/CT imaging may provide a novel means of visualization for ER stress in MAFLD or other diseases in vivo.

JOURNAL: Fluids and barriers of the CNS

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Background: P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is an efflux transporter which is abundantly expressed at the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and which has been implicated in the pathophysiology of various brain diseases. The radiolabelled antiemetic drug [11C]metoclopramide is a P-gp substrate for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of P-gp function at the BBB. To assess whether [11C]metoclopramide can detect increased P-gp function in the human brain, we employed drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) as a model disease with a well characterised, regional P-gp up-regulation at the BBB.

Methods: Eight patients with drug-resistant (DRE) TLE, 5 seizure-free patients with drug-sensitive (DSE) focal epilepsy, and 15 healthy subjects underwent brain PET imaging with [11C]metoclopramide on a fully-integrated PET/MRI system. Concurrent with PET, arterial blood sampling was performed to generate a metabolite-corrected arterial plasma input function for kinetic modelling. The choroid plexus was outmasked on the PET images to remove signal contamination from the neighbouring hippocampus. Using a brain atlas, 10 temporal lobe sub-regions were defined and analysed with a 1-tissue-2-rate constant compartmental model to estimate the rate constants for radiotracer transfer from plasma to brain (K1) and from brain to plasma (k2), and the total volume of distribution (VT= K1/k2).

Results: DRE patients but not DSE patients showed significantly higher k2values and a trend towards lower VTvalues in several temporal lobe sub-regions located ipsilateral to the epileptic focus as compared to healthy subjects (k2: hippocampus: +34%, anterior temporal lobe, medial part: +28%, superior temporal gyrus, posterior part: +21%).

Conclusions: [11C]Metoclopramide PET can detect a seizure-induced P-gp up-regulation in the epileptic brain. The efflux rate constant k2seems to be the most sensitive parameter to measure increased P-gp function with [11C]metoclopramide. Our study provides evidence that disease-induced alterations in P-gp expression at the BBB can lead to changes in the distribution of a central nervous system-active drug to the human brain, which could affect the efficacy and/or safety of drugs. [11C]Metoclopramide PET may be used to assess or predict the contribution of increased P-gp function to drug resistance and disease pathophysiology in various brain diseases.

TITLE: Nonlinear Mixed-Effects Modeling Approach for Simplified Reference Tissue Model

AUTHORS: Denise Shieh, Granville J Matheson, R Todd Ogden

JOURNAL: IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Objective: The conventional approach to the analysis of dynamic PET data can be described as a two-stage approach. In Stage 1, each individual's kinetic parameter estimates are obtained by modeling their PET data. Then in Stage 2, those parameter estimates are treated as though they are the observed data and compared across subjects and groups using standard statistical analyses. In this context, we explore the application of nonlinear mixed-effects (NLME) model under the assumptions of simplified reference tissue model.

Methods: In the NLME framework, all subject's PET data are modeled simultaneously and the estimation of kinetic parameters and statistical inference across subjects are performed jointly.

Results: In simulated [11C]WAY100635 data, this NLME approach shows improved power (6-27% increase) for detecting group differences and greater consistency of population (1.13-1.44 times greater) and individual-level parameter estimation compared to the two-stage approach applying simplified reference tissue model for pharmacokinetic modeling of PET data. We applied our NLME approach to clinical PET data and observed shrinkage of individual-level parameters that is inherent in this modeling structure.

Conclusion: The proposed approach is more powerful and accurate than the two-stage approach under the assumptions of simplified reference tissue model in PET data.

Significance: The stability of the NLME approach not only improves the efficiency of collected data, but also comes with no additional financial cost and negligible computation cost.

TITLE: Feasibility of Longitudinal Brain PET with Real-Time Arterial Input Function in Rats

AUTHORS: David Rey-Bretal, Alexis Moscoso, Noemí Gómez-Lado, Anxo Fernández-Ferreiro, Jesús Silva-Rodríguez, Álvaro Ruibal, Pablo Aguiar

JOURNAL: Molecular imaging and biology

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Preclinical dynamic brain PET studies remain hampered by the limitations related to the measurement of the arterial input function (AIF). In this regard, the use of an arterial-venous shunt is a promising method for the generation of real-time AIFs, but its application in longitudinal studies is still impeded by the cumbersome surgeries and high failure rates. We studied the feasibility and reproducibility of double arterial-venous shunt strategies for conducting longitudinal PET studies with real-time AIFs in rats.

Procedures: We studied the feasibility of double arterial-venous shunts in rats in the right/left inguinal region and evaluated inter-animal and intra-animal AIF reproducibilities. Image-derived input function (IDIF) was also obtained for comparison. Dynamic brain FDG PET studies were conducted to estimate kinetic constants and Cerebral Metabolic Rate of Glucose (CMRglc) obtained from standard 2-tissue compartment (2TCM) and Patlak analysis.

Results: We showed that longitudinal AIFs from double arterial-venous shunts can be obtained with very high success rate of the surgeries (88 %). Our results provided highly reproducible AIF measurements with low inter-animal variabilities (11 %) and intra-animal variabilities (5-10 %) that were included into the kinetic models, such that longitudinal rate constants and CMRglccan be efficiently estimated without bias associated to the double shunt. Our results indicated that longitudinal IDIF can be also generated without bias along time but showing higher intra-animal uncertainties.

Conclusions: We have demonstrated the feasibility and high reproducibility of conducting longitudinal AIF measurements and consequently accurate kinetic modeling using arterial shunt method.

TITLE: Deep learning applications for quantitative and qualitative PET in PET/MR: technical and clinical unmet needs

AUTHORS: Jaewon Yang, Asim Afaq, Robert Sibley, Alan McMilan, Ali Pirasteh

JOURNAL: Magma (New York, N.Y.)

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
We aim to provide an overview of technical and clinical unmet needs in deep learning (DL) applications for quantitative and qualitative PET in PET/MR, with a focus on attenuation correction, image enhancement, motion correction, kinetic modeling, and simulated data generation. (1) DL-based attenuation correction (DLAC) remains an area of limited exploration for pediatric whole-body PET/MR and lung-specific DLAC due to data shortages and technical limitations. (2) DL-based image enhancement approximating MR-guided regularized reconstruction with a high-resolution MR prior has shown promise in enhancing PET image quality. However, its clinical value has not been thoroughly evaluated across various radiotracers, and applications outside the head may pose challenges due to motion artifacts. (3) Robust training for DL-based motion correction requires pairs of motion-corrupted and motion-corrected PET/MR data. However, these pairs are rare. (4) DL-based approaches can address the limitations of dynamic PET, such as long scan durations that may cause patient discomfort and motion, providing new research opportunities. (5) Monte-Carlo simulations using anthropomorphic digital phantoms can provide extensive datasets to address the shortage of clinical data. This summary of technical/clinical challenges and potential solutions may provide research opportunities for the research community towards the clinical translation of DL solutions.

TITLE: 18F-Florbetaben PET/CT for the Diagnosis and Subtyping of Cardiac Amyloidosis: A Case Series and Review of the Literature

AUTHORS: Yu-Cheng Shih, Bing-Hsiean Tzeng, Meng-Chieh Tsai, Yuan-Bin Yu, Yu-Chien Shiau, Shan-Ying Wang, Yen-Wen Wu

JOURNAL: Acta Cardiologica Sinica

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Objectives: Cardiac amyloidosis (CA) is a type of systemic amyloidosis. Amyloid-targeting positron emission tomography (PET) has shown potential as an imaging method for CA. However, the optimal imaging protocol and role of18F-florbetaben (FBB) PET in the diagnosis and subtyping of CA have yet to be determined.

Methods: Patients with suspected CA who had positive or equivocal results of technetium-99m pyrophosphate (PYP) scintigraphy were enrolled for dynamic and late FBB PET imaging. In addition to visual assessment, a kinetic modeling-based approach including target-to-background ratio (TBR) and myocardial retention fraction (RF) of serial images reconstructed from a 20-min dynamic acquisition, and a late image at 110 min post-injection were performed. We compared FBB PET measures of four typical patients with light chain amyloidosis (AL), wild-type transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTRwt), variant transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTRv), and heart failure, respectively. We also reviewed the literature on the clinical use of amyloid PET in CA.

Results: Myocardial tracer retention was only found in the AL patient on the late images. TBR and RF were highest in the AL patient followed by the ATTRwt patient, and lowest in the ATTRv and non-CA patients.

Conclusions: FBB PET has potential in the detection and non-invasive subtyping of CA, especially in subjects with equivocal PYP findings or monoclonal gammopathy.

TITLE: Analytical methods for the investigation of enzyme-catalyzed degradation of polyethylene terephthalate

AUTHORS: Valentina Pirillo, Loredano Pollegioni, Gianluca Molla

JOURNAL: The FEBS journal

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
The polyester PET (poly(ethylene terephthalate)) plastic is chemically inert and remarkably persistent, posing relevant and global pollution concerns due to its accumulation in ecosystems across the globe. In past years, research focused on identifying bacteria active on PET and on the specific enzymes responsible for its degradation. Here, the enzymatic degradation of PET can be considered as an 'erosion process' that takes place on the surface of an insoluble material and results in an unusual, substrate-limited kinetic condition. In this review, we report on the most suitable models to evaluate the kinetics of PET-hydrolyzing enzymes, which takes into consideration the amount of enzyme adsorbed on the substrate, the enzyme-accessible ester bonds, and the product inhibition effects. Careful kinetic analysis is especially relevant to compare enzymes from different sources and evolved variants generated by protein engineering studies as well. Furthermore, the analytical methods most suitable to screen natural bacteria and recombinant variant libraries generated by protein engineering have been also reported. These methods rely on different detection systems and are performed both on model compounds and on different PET samples (e.g., nanoparticles, microparticles, and waste products). All this meaningful information represents an optimal starting point and boosts the process of identifying systems able to biologically recycle PET waste products.

TITLE: Modeling of Poly(Ethylene Terephthalate) Homogeneous Glycolysis Kinetics

AUTHORS: Kirill A Kirshanov, Roman V Toms, Mikhail S Balashov, Sergey S Golubkov, Pavel V Melnikov, Alexander Yu Gervald

JOURNAL: Polymers

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Polymer composites with various recycled poly(ethylene terephthalate)-based (PET-based) polyester matrices (poly(ethylene terephthalate), copolyesters, and unsaturated polyester resins), similar in properties to the primary ones, can be obtained based on PET glycolysis products after purification. PET glycolysis allows one to obtain bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate and oligo(ethylene terephthalates) with various molecular weights. A kinetic model of poly(ethylene terephthalate) homogeneous glycolysis under the combined or separate action of oligo(ethylene terephthalates), bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate, and ethylene glycol is proposed. The model takes into account the interaction of bound, terminal, and free ethylene glycol molecules in the PET feedstock and the glycolysis agent. Experimental data were obtained on the molecular weight distribution of poly(ethylene terephthalate) glycolysis products and the content of bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate monomer in them to verify the model. Homogeneous glycolysis of PET was carried out at atmospheric pressure in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) solvents with catalyst based on antimony trioxide (Sb2O3) under the action of different agents: ethylene glycol at temperatures of 165 and 180 °C; bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate at 250 °C; and oligoethylene terephthalate with polycondensation degree 3 at 250 °C. Homogeneous step-by-step glycolysis under the successive action of the oligo(ethylene terephthalate) trimer, bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate, and ethylene glycol at temperatures of 250, 220, and 190 °C, respectively, was also studied. The composition of products was confirmed using FTIR spectroscopy. Molecular weight characteristics were determined using gel permeation chromatography (GPC), the content of bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate was determined via extraction with water at 60 °C. The developed kinetic model was found to be in agreement with the experimental data and it could be used further to predict the optimal conditions for homogeneous PET glycolysis and to obtain polymer-based composite materials with desired properties.

TITLE: PET KinetiX-A Software Solution for PET Parametric Imaging at the Whole Field of View Level

AUTHORS: Florent L Besson, Sylvain Faure

JOURNAL: Journal of imaging informatics in medicine

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Kinetic modeling represents the ultimate foundations of PET quantitative imaging, a unique opportunity to better characterize the diseases or prevent the reduction of drugs development. Primarily designed for research, parametric imaging based on PET kinetic modeling may become a reality in future clinical practice, enhanced by the technical abilities of the latest generation of commercially available PET systems. In the era of precision medicine, such paradigm shift should be promoted, regardless of the PET system. In order to anticipate and stimulate this emerging clinical paradigm shift, we developed a constructor-independent software package, called PET KinetiX, allowing a faster and easier computation of parametric images from any 4D PET DICOM series, at the whole field of view level. The PET KinetiX package is currently a plug-in for Osirix DICOM viewer. The package provides a suite of five PET kinetic models: Patlak, Logan, 1-tissue compartment model, 2-tissue compartment model, and first pass blood flow. After uploading the 4D-PET DICOM series into Osirix, the image processing requires very few steps: the choice of the kinetic model and the definition of an input function. After a 2-min process, the PET parametric and error maps of the chosen model are automatically estimated voxel-wise and written in DICOM format. The software benefits from the graphical user interface of Osirix, making it user-friendly. Compared to PMOD-PKIN (version 4.4) on twelve18F-FDG PET dynamic datasets, PET KinetiX provided an absolute bias of 0.1% (0.05-0.25) and 5.8% (3.3-12.3) for KiPatlakand Ki2TCM, respectively. Several clinical research illustrative cases acquired on different hybrid PET systems (standard or extended axial fields of view, PET/CT, and PET/MRI), with different acquisition schemes (single-bed single-pass or multi-bed multipass), are also provided. PET KinetiX is a very fast and efficient independent research software that helps molecular imaging users easily and quickly produce 3D PET parametric images from any reconstructed 4D-PET data acquired on standard or large PET systems.

TITLE: PET-determined myocardial perfusion and flow in coronary artery disease characterization

AUTHORS: Ines Valenta, Thomas H Schindler

JOURNAL: Journal of medical imaging and radiation sciences

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Positron emission tomography (PET) myocardial perfusion imaging in conjunction with tracer-kinetic modeling enables the concurrent assessment of myocardial perfusion and regional myocardial blood flow (MBF) of the left ventricle in absolute terms in milliliters per gram per minute (mL/g/min). The non-invasive quantification of MBF during pharmacologically induced hyperemia, at rest, and corresponding myocardial flow reserve (MFR) opens a new avenue for the identification and characterization of classical or endogen type of coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD) as functional substrate for microvascular angina in patients with non-obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) and/or no CAD at all. Further, PET-MBF quantification expands the scope of conventional myocardial perfusion imaging from the identification of advanced, and flow-limiting, epicardial CAD to early stages of atherosclerosis and/or CMD. Adding MBF assessment to myocardial perfusion may also reliably unravel diffuse ischemia owing to significant left main stenosis and/or multivessel CAD, commonly confirmed by peak stress transient ischemic cavity dilation of the left ventricle during maximal vasomotor stress compared to rest on gated PET images. Owing to high spatial and contrast resolution in conjunction with photon-attenuation free myocardial perfusion PET images, PET is preferentially used for CAD detection in advanced obesity and women with pronounced breast habitus. With increasing clinical use of cardiac PET perfusion and MBF assessment, individualized, and image-guided cardiovascular treatment decisions in CAD patients is likely to ensue, while its translation into improved cardiovascular outcome remains to be investigated.

TITLE: Accuracy of arterial [18F]-Fluorodeoxyglucose uptake quantification: A kinetic modeling study

AUTHORS: Jakub Toczek, Jing Wu, Ansel T Hillmer, Jinah Han, Irina Esterlis, Kelly P Cosgrove, Chi Liu, Mehran M Sadeghi

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear cardiology : official publication of the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
2-deoxy-2- [18F] fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) PET is commonly used for the assessment of vessel wall inflammation. Guidelines for analysis of arterial wall FDG signal recommend the use of the average of maximal standardized uptake value (mean SUVmax) and target-to-blood (mean TBRmax) ratio. However, these methods have not been validated against a gold standard such as tissue activity ex vivo or net uptake rate of FDG (Ki) obtained using kinetic modeling. We sought to evaluate the accuracy of mean SUVmaxand mean TBRmaxfor aortic wall FDG signal quantification in comparison with the net uptake rate of FDG.

Methods: Dynamic PET data from 13 subjects without prior history of cardiovascular disease who enrolled in a study of vascular inflammation were used for this analysis. Ex vivo measurement of plasma activity was used as the input function and voxel-by-voxel Patlak analysis was performed with t* = 20 minute to obtain the Kiimage. The FDG signal in the ascending aortic wall was quantified on PET images following recent guidelines for vascular imaging to determine mean SUVmaxand mean TBRmax.

Results: The Kiin the ascending aortic wall did not correlate with mean SUVmax(r = 0.10, P = NS), but correlated with mean TBRmax(r = 0.82, P < 0.001) (Figure 1B). Kiand Ki_maxstrongly correlated (R = 0.96, P < 0.0001) and similar to Ki, Ki_maxdid not correlate with mean SUVmax(r = 0.17, P = NS), but correlated with mean TBRmax(r = 0.83, P < 0.001).

Conclusions: Kinetic modeling supports the use of mean TBRmaxas a surrogate for the net uptake rate of FDG in the arterial wall. These results are relevant to any PET imaging agent, regardless of the biological significance of the tracer uptake in the vessel wall.

TITLE: FDG PET/CT of the non-malignant liver in an increasingly obese world population

AUTHORS: Georgia Keramida, A Michael Peters

JOURNAL: Clinical physiology and functional imaging

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Because of obesity, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is becoming increasingly important. 10% of NAFLD patients develop non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which may progress to cirrhosis and is now the leading indication for liver transplantation in the Western world. Prefibrotic NASH can only be reliably diagnosed by biopsy. However, given its success in other inflammatory diseases, PET/CT with18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), although non-specific, may offer a promising approach to diagnosing not only NASH but also other inflammatory liver conditions. In addition, FDG PET has generated pathophysiological information on hepatic glucose metabolism and, diagnostically, used liver for quantification of tumour FDG accumulation (e.g. Deauville scoring). A review of hepatic FDG PET is therefore timely. There are two general approaches to the quantification of hepatic FDG accumulation: firstly, standard uptake value (SUV) and secondly dynamic PET. SUV is a poor index of hepatic metabolic function because most hepatic FDG (~75%) is un-phosphorylated 60-min postinjection. Hepatic fat is increased in NAFLD but accumulates negligible FDG. Because fat distribution is heterogeneous, maximum pixel SUV is therefore preferred to mean pixel SUV. Computer modelling of dynamic PET dissects the transport constants governing hepatic FDG kinetics but is challenged by the liver's dual blood supply. Graphical analysis is less informative but more robust and will be the preferred clinical approach to measurement of hepatic FDG phosphorylation. Previous dynamic PET studies have ignored hepatic fat and therefore potentially underestimated glucose accumulation in patients with hepatic steatosis. Future work should use graphical analysis of dynamic PET and correction for hepatic fat.

AUTHORS: Anna Schildt, Erik F J de Vries, Antoon T M Willemsen, Rodrigo Moraga-Amaro, Bruno Lima-Giacobbo, Jürgen W A Sijbesma, Vesna Sossi, Rudi A J O Dierckx, Janine Doorduin

JOURNAL: Molecular imaging and biology

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: [18F]Fluoroethoxybenzovesamicol ([18F]FEOBV) is a radioligand for the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT), a marker of the cholinergic system. We evaluated the quantification of [18F]FEOBV in rats in control conditions and after partial saturation of VAChT using plasma and reference tissue input models and test-retest reliability.

Procedure: Ninety-minute dynamic [18F]FEOBV PET scans with arterial blood sampling were performed in control rats and rats pretreated with 10 μg/kg FEOBV. Kinetic analyses were performed using one- (1TCM) and two-tissue compartmental models (2TCM), Logan and Patlak graphical analyses with metabolite-corrected plasma input, reference tissue Patlak with cerebellum as reference tissue, standard uptake value (SUV) and SUV ratio (SUVR) using 60- or 90-min acquisition. To assess test-retest reliability, two dynamic [18F]FEOBV scans were performed 1 week apart.

Results: The 1TCM did not fit the data. Time-activity curves were more reliably estimated by the irreversible than the reversible 2TCM for 60 and 90 min as the influx rate Kishowed a lower coefficient of variation (COV, 14-24 %) than the volume of distribution VT(16-108 %). Patlak graphical analysis showed a good fit to the data for both acquisition times with a COV (12-27 %) comparable to the irreversible 2TCM. For 60 min, Logan analysis performed comparably to both irreversible models (COV 14-32 %) but showed lower sensitivity to VAChT saturation. Partial saturation of VAChT did not affect model selection when using plasma input. However, poor correlations were found between irreversible 2TCM and SUV and SUVR in partially saturated VAChT states. Test-retest reliability and intraclass correlation for SUV were good.

Conclusion: [18F]FEOBV is best modeled using the irreversible 2TCM or Patlak graphical analysis. SUV should only be used if blood sampling is not possible.

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear cardiology : official publication of the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology

ABSTRACT:
Background: I-123 meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) imaging has long been employed to noninvasively assess the integrity of human norepinephrine transporter-1 and, hence, myocardial sympathetic innervation. Positron-emitting F-18 meta-fluorobenzylguanidine (MFBG) has recently been developed for potentially superior quantitative characterization. We assessed the feasibility of MFBG imaging of myocardial sympathetic innervation.

Methods: 16 patients were imaged with MFBG PET (30-minute dynamic imaging of chest, followed by 3 whole-body acquisitions between 30 minutes and 4-hour post-injection). Blood kinetics were assessed from multiple samples. Pharmacokinetic modeling with reversible 1- and 2-compartment models was performed. Kinetic rate constants were re-calculated from truncated datasets. All patients underwent concurrent MIBG SPECT.

Results: MFBG myocardial uptake was rapid and sustained; the mean standardized uptake value (SUV (mean ± standard deviation)) was 5.1 ± 2.2 and 3.4 ± 1.9 at 1 hour and 3-4-hour post-injection, respectively. The mean K1and distribution volume (VT) were 1.1 ± 0.6 mL/min/g and 34 ± 22 mL/cm3, respectively. Both were reproducible when re-calculated from truncated 1-hour datasets (Intraclass Correlation Coefficient of 0.99 and 0.91, respectively). Spearman's ϱ = 0.86 between MFBG SUV and VTand 0.80 between MFBG PET-derived VTand MIBG SPECT-derived heart-to-mediastinum activity concentration ratio.

Conclusion: MFBG is a promising PET radiotracer for the assessment of myocardial sympathetic innervation.

TITLE: Estimation of kinetic parameters in dynamic FDG PET imaging based on shortened protocols: a virtual clinical study

AUTHORS: Niloufar Reshtebar, Seyed Abolfazl Hosseini, Mingzan Zhuang, Peyman Sheikhzadeh

JOURNAL: Physical and engineering sciences in medicine

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
This study investigated the estimation of kinetic parameters and production of related parametric Kiimages in FDG PET imaging using the proposed shortened protocol (three 3-min/bed routine static images) by means of the simulated annealing (SA) algorithm. Six realistic heterogeneous tumors and various levels of [18F] FDG uptake were simulated by the XCAT phantom. An irreversible two-tissue compartment model (2TCM) using population-based input function was employed. By keeping two routine clinical scans fixed (60-min and 90-min post injection), the effect of the early scan time on optimizing the estimation of the pharmacokinetic parameters was investigated. The SA optimization algorithm was applied to estimate micro- and macro-parameters (K1, k2,k3, Ki). The minimum bias for most parameters was observed at a scan time of 20-min, which was < 10%. A highly significant correlation (> 0.9) as well as limited bias (< 10%) were observed between kinetic parameters generated from two methods [two-tissue compartment full dynamic scan (2TCM-full) and two-tissue compartment by SA algorithm (2TCM-SA)]. The analysis showed a strong correlation (> 0.8) between (2TCM-SA) Kiand SUV images. In addition, the tumor-to-background ratio (TBR) metric in the parametric (2TCM-SA) Kiimages was significantly higher than SUV, although the SUV images provide better Contrast-to-noise ratio relative to parametric (2TCM-SA) Kiimages. The proposed shortened protocol by the SA algorithm can estimate the kinetic parameters in FDG PET scan with high accuracy and robustness. It was also concluded that the parametric Kiimages obtained from the 2TCM-SA as a complementary image of the SUV possess more quantification information than SUV images and can be used by the nuclear medicine specialist. This method has the potential to be an alternative to a full dynamic PET scan.

ABSTRACT:
Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a valuable imaging method for studying molecular-level processes in the body, such as hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau) protein aggregates, a hallmark of several neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease. P-tau density and cerebral perfusion can be quantified from dynamic PET images using tracer kinetic modeling techniques. However, noise in PET images leads to uncertainty in the estimated kinetic parameters, which can be quantified by estimating the posterior distribution of kinetic parameters using Bayesian inference (BI). Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques are commonly used for posterior estimation but with significant computational needs. This work proposes an Improved Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (iDDPM)-based method to estimate the posterior distribution of kinetic parameters in dynamic PET, leveraging the high computational efficiency of deep learning. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated on a [18F]MK6240 study and compared to a Conditional Variational Autoencoder with dual decoder (CVAE-DD)-based method and a Wasserstein GAN with gradient penalty (WGAN-GP)-based method. Posterior distributions inferred from Metropolis-Hasting MCMC were used as reference. Our approach consistently outperformed the CVAE-DD and WGAN-GP methods and offered significant reduction in computation time than the MCMC method (over 230 times faster), inferring accurate (< 0.67% mean error) and precise (< 7.23% standard deviation error) posterior distributions.

ABSTRACT:
O-GlcNAcylation is thought to play a role in the development of tau pathology in Alzheimer's disease because of its ability to modulate tau's aggregation propensity.O-GlcNAcylation is regulated by 2 enzymes:O-GlcNAc transferase andO-GlcNAcase (OGA). Development of a PET tracer would therefore be an essential tool for developing therapeutic small-molecule inhibitors of OGA, enabling clinical testing of target engagement and dose selection.Methods:A collection of small-molecule compounds was screened for inhibitory activity and high-affinity binding to OGA, as well as favorable PET tracer attributes (multidrug resistance protein 1 efflux, central nervous system PET multiparameter optimization, etc.). Two lead compounds with high affinity and selectivity for OGA were selected for further profiling, including OGA binding to tissue homogenate using a radioligand competition binding assay. In vivo pharmacokinetics were established using a microdosing approach with unlabeled compounds in rats. In vivo imaging studies were performed in rodents and nonhuman primates (NHPs) with11C-labeled compounds.Results:Two selected candidates, BIO-735 and BIO-578, displayed promising attributes in vitro. After radiolabeling with tritium, [3H]BIO-735 and [3H]BIO-578 binding in rodent brain homogenates demonstrated dissociation constants of 0.6 and 2.3 nM, respectively. Binding was inhibited, concentration-dependently, by homologous compounds and thiamet G, a well-characterized and structurally diverse OGA inhibitor. Imaging studies in rats and NHPs showed both tracers had high uptake in the brain and inhibition of binding to OGA in the presence of a nonradioactive compound. However, only BIO-578 demonstrated reversible binding kinetics within the time frame of a PET study with a11C-labeled molecule to enable quantification using kinetic modeling. Specificity of tracer uptake was confirmed with a 10 mg/kg blocking dose of thiamet G.Conclusion:We describe the development and testing of 211C PET tracers targeting the protein OGA. The lead compound BIO-578 demonstrated high affinity and selectivity for OGA in rodent and human postmortem brain tissue, leading to its further testing in NHPs. NHP PET imaging studies showed that the tracer had excellent brain kinetics, with full inhibition of specific binding by thiamet G. These results suggest that the tracer [11C]BIO-578 is well suited for further characterization in humans.

TITLE: Quantitative assessment of translocator protein (TSPO) in the non-human primate brain and clinical translation of [18F]LW223 as a TSPO-targeted PET radioligand

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Objectives: Translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO) positron emission tomography (PET) can be harnessed for the non-invasive detection of macrophage-driven inflammation. [18F]LW223, a newly reported TSPO PET tracer which was insensitive to rs6971 polymorphism, showed favorable performance characteristics in a recent imaging study involving a rat myocardial infarction model. To enable quantitative neuroimaging with [18F]LW223, we conducted kinetic analysis in the non-human primate (NHP) brain. Further, we sought to assess the utility of [18F]LW223-based TSPO imaging in a first-in-human study.

Methods: Radiosynthesis of [18F]LW223 was accomplished on an automated module, whereas molar activities, stability in formulation, lipophilicity and unbound free fraction (fu) of the probe were measured. Brain penetration and target specificity of [18F]LW223 in NHPs were corroborated by PET-MR imaging under baseline and pre-blocking conditions using the validated TSPO inhibitor, (R)-PK11195, at doses ranging from 5 to 10 mg/kg. Kinetic modeling was performed using one-tissue compartment model (1TCM), two-tissue compartment model (2TCM) and Logan graphical analyses, using dynamic PET data acquisition, arterial blood collection and metabolic stability testing. Clinical PET scans were performed in two healthy volunteers (HVs). Regional brain standard uptake value ratio (SUVr) was assessed for different time intervals.

Results: [18F]LW223 was synthesized in non-decay corrected radiochemical yields (n.d.c. RCYs) of 33.3 ± 6.5% with molar activities ranging from 1.8 ± 0.7 Ci/µmol (n = 11). [18F]LW223 was stable in formulation for up to 4 h and LogD7.4of 2.31 ± 0.13 (n = 6) and fuof 5.80 ± 1.42% (n = 6) were determined. [18F]LW223 exhibited good brain penetration in NHPs, with a peak SUV value of ca. 1.79 in the whole brain. Pre-treatment with (R)-PK11195 substantially accelerated the washout and attenuated the area under the time-activity curve, indicating in vivo specificity of [18F]LW223 towards TSPO. Kinetic modeling demonstrated that 2TCM was the most suitable model for [18F]LW223-based neuroimaging. Global transfer rate constants (K1) and total volumes of distribution (VT) were found to be 0.10 ± 0.01 mL/cm3/min and 2.30 ± 0.17 mL/cm3, respectively. Dynamic PET data analyses across distinct time windows revealed that the VTvalues were relatively stable after 60 min post-injection. In a preliminary clinical study with two healthy volunteers, [18F]LW223 exhibited good brain uptake and considerable tracer retention across all analyzed brain regions. Of note, an excellent correlation between SUVr with VTwas obtained when assessing the time interval from 20 to 40 min post tracer injection (SUVr(20-40 min), R2= 0.94, p < 0.0001), suggesting this time window may be suitable to estimate specific binding to TSPO in human brain.

Conclusion: Our findings indicate that [18F]LW223 is suitable for quantitative TSPO-targeted PET imaging in higher species. Employing state-of-the-art kinetic modeling, we found that [18F]LW223 was effective in mapping TSPO throughout the NHP brain, with best model fits obtained from 2TCM and Logan graphical analyses. Overall, our results indicate that [18F]LW223 exhibits favorable tracer performance characteristics in higher species, and this novel imaging tool may hold promise to provide effective neuroinflammation imaging in patients with neurological disease.

ABSTRACT:
[18F]MK-6240 meningeal/extracerebral off-target binding may impact tau quantification. We examined the kinetics and longitudinal changes of extracerebral and reference regions. [18F]MK-6240 PET was performed in 24 cognitively-normal and eight cognitively-impaired subjects, with arterial samples in 13 subjects. Follow-up scans at 6.1 ± 0.5 (n = 25) and 13.3 ± 0.9 (n = 16) months were acquired. Extracerebral and reference region (cerebellar gray matter (CerGM)-based, cerebral white matter (WM), pons) uptake were evaluated using standardized uptake values (SUV90-110), spectral analysis, and distribution volume. Longitudinal changes in SUV90-110were examined. The impact of reference region on target region outcomes, partial volume correction (PVC) and regional erosion were evaluated. Eroded WM and pons showed lower variability, lower extracerebral contamination, and lower longitudinal changes than CerGM-based regions. CerGM-based regions resulted larger cross-sectional effect sizes for group differentiation. Extracerebral signal was high in 50% of subjects and exhibited irreversible kinetics and nonsignificant longitudinal changes over one-year but was highly variable at subject-level. PVC resulted in higher variability in reference region uptake and longitudinal changes. Our results suggest that eroded CerGM may be preferred for cross-sectional, whilst eroded WM or pons may be preferred for longitudinal [18F]MK-6240 studies. For CerGM, erosion was necessary (preferred over PVC) to address the heterogenous nature of extracerebral signal.

TITLE: Dynamic total-body PET/CT imaging with reduced acquisition time shows acceptable performance in quantification of [18F]FDG tumor kinetic metrics

AUTHORS: Guobing Liu, Yimeng Shi, Xiaoguang Hou, Haojun Yu, Yan Hu, Yiqiu Zhang, Hongcheng Shi

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: To investigate the feasibility of reducing the acquisition time for continuous dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) while retaining acceptable performance in quantifying kinetic metrics of 2-[18F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose ([18F]FDG) in tumors.

Methods: In total, 78 oncological patients underwent total-body dynamic PET imaging for ≥ 60 min, with 8, 20, and 50 patients receiving full activity (3.7 MBq/kg), half activity (1.85 MBq/kg), and ultra-low activity (0.37 MBq/kg) of [18F]FDG, respectively. The dynamic data were divided into 21-, 30-, 45- and ≥ 60-min groups. The kinetic analysis involved model fitting to derive constant rates (VB, K1to k3, and Ki) for both tumors and normal tissues, using both reversible and irreversible two-tissue-compartment models. One-way ANOVA with repeated measures or the Freidman test compared the kinetic metrics among groups, while the Deming regression assessed the correlation of kinetic metrics among groups.

Results: All kinetic metrics in the 30-min and 45-min groups were statistically comparable to those in the ≥ 60-min group. The relative differences between the 30-min and ≥ 60-min groups ranged from 12.3% ± 15.1% for K1to 29.8% ± 30.0% for VB, and those between the 45-min and ≥ 60-min groups ranged from 7.5% ± 8.7% for Ki to 24.0% ± 24.3% for VB. However, this comparability was not observed between the 21-min and ≥ 60-min groups. The significance trend of these comparisons remained consistent across different models (reversible or irreversible), administrated activity levels, and partial volume corrections for lesions. Significant correlations in tumor kinetic metrics were identified between the 30-/45-min and ≥ 60-min groups, with Deming regression slopes > 0.813. In addition, the comparability of kinetic metrics between the 30-min and ≥ 60-min groups were established for normal tissues.

Conclusion: The acquisition time for dynamic PET imaging can be reduced to 30 min without compromising the ability to reveal tumor kinetic metrics of [18F]FDG, using the total-body PET/CT system.

ABSTRACT:
In contrast to cardiac sympathetic activity which can be assessed with established PET tracers, there are currently no suitable radioligands to measure cardiac parasympathetic (cholinergic) activity. A radioligand able to measure cardiac cholinergic activity would be an invaluable clinical and research tool since cholinergic dysfunction has been associated with a wide array of pathologies (e.g., chronic heart failure, myocardial infarction, arrythmias). [18F]Fluoroethoxybenzovesamicol (FEOBV) is a cholinergic radiotracer that has been extensively validated in the brain. Whether FEOBV PET can be used to assess cholinergic activity in the heart is not known. Hence, this study aimed to evaluate the properties of FEOBV for cardiac PET imaging and cholinergic activity mapping. PET data were collected for 40 minutes after injection of 230 ± 50 MBq of FEOBV in four healthy participants (1 female; Age: 37 ± 10; BMI: 25 ± 2). Dynamic LV time activity curves were fitted with Logan graphical, 1-tissue compartment, and 2-tissue compartment models, yielding similar distribution volume estimates for each participant. Our initial data show that FEOBV PET has favorable tracer kinetics for quantification of cholinergic activity and is a promising new method for assessing parasympathetic function in the heart.

TITLE: Total-body dynamic PET/CT imaging reveals kinetic distribution of [13N]NH3 in normal organs

AUTHORS: Guobing Liu, Taoying Gu, Shuguang Chen, Yushen Gu, Haojun Yu, Hongcheng Shi

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: To systematically investigate kinetic metrics and metabolic trapping of [13N]NH3in organs.

Methods: Eleven participants performed total-body [13N]NH3dynamic positron emission tomography (PET). Regions of interest were drawn in organs to obtain time-to-activity curves (TACs), which were fitted with an irreversible two-tissue compartment model (2TC) to investigate constant rates K1, k2and k3, and to calculate Ki. Additionally, one-tissue compartment model using full data (1TCfull) and the first four minutes of data (1TC4min) were fitted to TAC data. K1and k2were compared among different models to assess [13N]NH3trapping in organs.

Results: Kinetic rates of [13N]NH3varied significantly among organs. The mean K1ranged from 0.049 mL/cm3/min in the muscle to 2.936 mL/cm3/min in the kidney. The k2and k3were lowest in the liver (0.001 min- 1) and in the pituitary (0.009 min- 1), while highest in the kidney (0.587 min- 1) and in the liver (0.800 min- 1), respectively. The Ki was largest in the myocardium (0.601 ± 0.259 mL/cm3/min) while smallest in the bone marrow (0.028 ± 0.022 mL/cm3/min). Three groups of organs with similar kinetic characteristics were revealed: (1) the thyroid, the lung, the spleen, the pancreas, and the kidney; (2) the liver and the muscle; and (3) the cortex, the white matter, the cerebellum, the pituitary, the parotid, the submandibular gland, the myocardium, the bone, and the bone marrow. Obvious k3was identified in multiple organs, and significant changes of K1in multiple organs and k2in most organs were found between 2TC and 1TCfull, but both K1and k2were comparable between 2TC and 1TC4min.

Conclusion: The kinetic rates of [13N]NH3differed among organs with some have obvious13N-anmmonia trapping. The normal distribution of kinetic metrics of13N-anmmonia in organs can serve as a reference for its potential use in tumor imaging.

TITLE: Image Quantification for TSPO PET with a Novel Image-Derived Input Function Method

AUTHORS: Yu-Hua Dean Fang, Jonathan E McConathy, Talene A Yacoubian, Yue Zhang, Richard E Kennedy, David G Standaert

JOURNAL: Diagnostics (Basel, Switzerland)

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
There is a growing interest in using 18F-DPA-714 PET to study neuroinflammation and microglial activation through imaging the 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO). Although quantification of 18F-DPA-714 binding can be achieved through kinetic modeling analysis with an arterial input function (AIF) measured with blood sampling procedures, the invasiveness of such procedures has been an obstacle for wide application. To address these challenges, we developed an image-derived input function (IDIF) that noninvasively estimates the arterial input function from the images acquired for 18F-DPA-714 quantification. Methods: The method entails three fully automatic steps to extract the IDIF, including a segmentation of voxels with highest likelihood of being the arterial blood over the carotid artery, a model-based matrix factorization to extract the arterial blood signal, and a scaling optimization procedure to scale the extracted arterial blood signal into the activity concentration unit. Two cohorts of human subjects were used to evaluate the extracted IDIF. In the first cohort of five subjects, arterial blood sampling was performed, and the calculated IDIF was validated against the measured AIF through the comparison of distribution volumes from AIF (VT,AIF) and IDIF (VT,IDIF). In the second cohort, PET studies from twenty-eight healthy controls without arterial blood sampling were used to compare VT,IDIF with VT,REF measured using a reference region-based analysis to evaluate whether it can distinguish high-affinity (HAB) and mixed-affinity (MAB) binders. Results: In the arterial blood-sampling cohort, VT derived from IDIF was found to be an accurate surrogate of the VT from AIF. The bias of VT, IDIF was −5.8 ± 7.8% when compared to VT,AIF, and the linear mixed effect model showed a high correlation between VT,AIF and VT, IDIF (p < 0.001). In the nonblood-sampling cohort, VT, IDIF showed a significance difference between the HAB and MAB healthy controls. VT, IDIF and standard uptake values (SUV) showed superior results in distinguishing HAB from MAB subjects than VT,REF. Conclusions: A novel IDIF method for 18F-DPA-714 PET quantification was developed and evaluated in this study. This IDIF provides a noninvasive alternative measurement of VT to quantify the TSPO binding of 18F-DPA-714 in the human brain through dynamic PET scans.

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Using different tracers in positron emission tomography (PET) imaging can bring complementary information on tumor heterogeneities. Ideally, PET images of different tracers should be acquired simultaneously to avoid the bias induced by movement and physiological changes between sequential acquisitions. Previous studies have demonstrated the feasibility of recovering separated PET signals or parameters of two or more tracers injected (quasi-)simultaneously in a single acquisition. In this study, a generic framework in the context of dual-tracer PET acquisition is proposed where no strong kinetic assumptions nor specific tuning of parameters are required. The performances of the framework were assessed through simulations involving the combination of [18F]FCH and [18F]FDG injections, two protocols (90 and 60 min acquisition durations) and various activity ratios between the two injections. Preclinical experiments with the same radiotracers were also conducted. Results demonstrate the ability of the method both to extract separated arterial input functions (AIF) from noisy image-derived input function and to separate the dynamic signals and further estimate kinetic parameters. The compromise between bias and variance associated with the estimation of net influx rateKishows that it is preferable to use the second injected radiotracer with twice the activity of the first for both 90 min [18F]FCH+[18F]FDG and 60 min [18F]FDG+[18F]FCH protocols. In these optimal settings, the weighted mean-squared-error of the estimated AIF was always less than 7%. TheKibias was similar to the one of single-tracer acquisitions; below 5%. Compared to single-tracer results, the variance ofKiwas twice more for 90 min dual-tracer scenario and four times more for the 60 min scenario. The generic design of the method makes it easy to use for other pairs of radiotracers and even for more than two tracers. The absence of strong kinetic assumptions and tuning parameters makes it suitable for a possible use in clinical routine.

ABSTRACT:
Background: The need for arterial blood data in quantitative PET research limits the wider usability of this imaging method in clinical research settings. Image-derived input function (IDIF) approaches have been proposed as a cost-effective and non-invasive alternative to gold-standard arterial sampling. However, this approach comes with its own limitations-partial volume effects and radiometabolite correction among the most important-and varying rates of success, and the use of IDIF for brain PET has been particularly troublesome.

Main body: This paper summarizes the limitations of IDIF methods for quantitative PET imaging and discusses some of the advances that may make IDIF extraction more reliable. The introduction of automated pipelines (both commercial and open-source) for clinical PET scanners is discussed as a way to improve the reliability of IDIF approaches and their utility for quantitative purposes. Survey data gathered from the PET community are then presented to understand whether the field's opinion of the usefulness and validity of IDIF is improving. Finally, as the introduction of next-generation PET scanners with long axial fields of view, ultra-high sensitivity, and improved spatial and temporal resolution, has also brought IDIF methods back into the spotlight, a discussion of the possibilities offered by these state-of-the-art scanners-inclusion of large vessels, less partial volume in small vessels, better description of the full IDIF kinetics, whole-body modeling of radiometabolite production-is included, providing a pathway for future use of IDIF.

Conclusion: Improvements in PET scanner technology and software for automated IDIF extraction may allow to solve some of the major limitations associated with IDIF, such as partial volume effects and poor temporal sampling, with the exciting potential for accurate estimation of single kinetic rates. Nevertheless, until individualized radiometabolite correction can be performed effectively, IDIF approaches remain confined at best to a few tracers.

JOURNAL: Quantitative imaging in medicine and surgery

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
The use of Isolated lung perfusion (ILP), combined with medical imaging modalities such as positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET/CT), provides real-time visualization of tumors in ventilated and perfused vital lung tissue. This experiment intends to show the feasibility and benefits of using ILP combined with PET/CT imaging. Following lung surgery on a 49-year-old male, his left lower lobectomy specimen, which held a typical carcinoid tumor, was preserved on normothermic ILP. Gallium-68-Edotreotide ([68Ga]-DOTATOC) was administered into the ILP circuit, and dynamic emission data from PET/CT was acquired. ILP was carried out for 120 minutes. Near physiologic gas exchange and glucose metabolism were preserved throughout the experiment. The time activity curves (TAC) of 5 different volumes of interest (VOI) showed notable differences in tracer uptake over time. The peripheral area of the carcinoid exhibited delayed but high somatostatin receptor agonist uptake compared to the surrounding parenchyma and the intrapulmonary artery. However, the central area of the carcinoid showed very low [68Ga]-DOTATOC uptake. This experiment demonstrates the potential of ILP combined with PET/CT for kinetic modeling in experimental nuclear medicine imaging. By providing visualization of tracer uptake in perfused lung tissue, this model could potentially improve our understanding of tumor physiology and molecular imaging.

Objectives: We aimed to develop a dynamic imaging technique for a novel PET superoxide tracer, [18F]DHMT, to allow for absolute quantification of myocardial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in a large animal model.

Methods: Six beagle dogs underwent a single baseline dynamic [18F]DHMT PET study, whereas one animal underwent three serial dynamic studies over the course of chronic doxorubicin administration (1 mg·kg-1·week-1for 15 weeks). During the scans, sequential arterial blood samples were obtained for plasma metabolite correction. The optimal compartment model and graphical analysis method were identified for kinetic modeling. Values for the left ventricular (LV) net influx rate, Ki, were reported for all the studies and compared with the LV standard uptake values (SUVs) and the LV-to-blood pool SUV ratios from the 60 to 90 minute static images. Parametric images were also generated.

Results: [18F]DHMT followed irreversible kinetics once oxidized within the myocardium in the presence of superoxide, as evidenced by the fitting generated by the irreversible two-tissue (2Ti) compartment model and the linearity of Patlak analysis. Myocardial Kivalues showed a weak correlation with LV SUV (R2= 0.27), but a strong correlation with LV-to-blood pool SUV ratio (R2= 0.92). Generation of high-quality parametric images showed superior myocardial to blood contrast compared to static images.

Conclusions: A dynamic PET imaging technique for [18F]DHMT was developed with full and simplified kinetic modeling for absolute quantification of myocardial superoxide production in a large animal model.

TITLE: In vivo18F-DOPA PET imaging identifies a dopaminergic deficit in a rat model with a G51D α-synuclein mutation

ABSTRACT:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative condition with several major hallmarks, including loss ofsubstantia nigraneurons, reduction in striatal dopaminergic function, and formation of α-synuclein-rich Lewy bodies. Mutations inSNCA, encoding for α-synuclein, are a known cause of familial PD, and the G51D mutation causes a particularly aggressive form of the condition. CRISPR/Cas9 technology was used to introduce the G51D mutation into the endogenous ratSNCAgene.SNCAG51D/+andSNCAG51D/G51Drats were born in Mendelian ratios and did not exhibit any severe behavourial defects.L-3,4-dihydroxy-6-18F-fluorophenylalanine (18F-DOPA) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging was used to investigate this novel rat model. Wild-type (WT),SNCAG51D/+andSNCAG51D/G51Drats were characterized over the course of ageing (5, 11, and 16 months old) using18F-DOPA PET imaging and kinetic modelling. We measured the influx rate constant () and effective distribution volume ratio (EDVR) of18F-DOPA in the striatum relative to the cerebellum in WT,SNCAG51D/+andSNCAG51D/G51Drats. A significant reduction inEDVRwas observed inSNCAG51D/G51Drats at 16 months of age indicative of increased dopamine turnover. Furthermore, we observed a significant asymmetry inEDVRbetween the left and right striatum in agedSNCAG51D/G51Drats. The increased and asymmetric dopamine turnover observed in the striatum of agedSNCAG51D/G51Drats reflects one aspect of prodromal PD, and suggests the presence of compensatory mechanisms.SNCAG51Drats represent a novel genetic model of PD, and kinetic modelling of18F-DOPA PET data has identified a highly relevant early disease phenotype.

TITLE: The Importance of PET Imaging to Understanding Whole-Body Cortisol Metabolism in Alzheimer's Disease

AUTHORS: Jason Bini

JOURNAL: Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Excess cortisol is associated with more severe cognitive decline, Alzheimer's disease, and related dementia phenotypes. The intracellular enzyme 11β-HSD1 regenerates active cortisol from inactive cortisone. In this current issue, high regional brain occupancy of Xanamemtrademark, determined by [11C]TARACT PET imaging of 11β-HSD1, in cognitively normal individuals and mild cognitive impartment/Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients is presented. In the future, comprehensive kinetic modeling using arterial sampling for occupancy studies, and whole-body PET imaging of 11β-HSD1 enzyme levels, in combination with stable isotope studies of cortisol metabolism, can provide broad insight into enzyme levels and activity in AD and other relevant diseases.

ABSTRACT:
Background: Myocardial perfusion imaging by positron emission tomography (PET-MPI) is the current gold standard for quantification of myocardial blood flow.18F-flurpiridaz was recently introduced as a valid alternative to currently used PET-MPI probes. Nonetheless, optimum scan duration and time interval for image analysis are currently unknown. Further, it is unclear whether rest/stress PET-MPI with18F-flurpiridaz is feasible in mice.

Methods: Rest/stress PET-MPI was performed with18F-flurpiridaz (0.6-3.0 MBq) in 27 mice aged 7-8 months. Regadenoson (0.1 µg/g) was used for induction of vasodilator stress. Kinetic modeling was performed using a metabolite-corrected arterial input function. Image-derived myocardial18F-flurpiridaz uptake was assessed for different time intervals by placing a volume of interest in the left ventricular myocardium.

Results: Tracer kinetics were best described by a two-tissue compartment model. K1ranged from 6.7 to 20.0 mL·cm-3·min-1, while myocardial volumes of distribution (VT) were between 34.6 and 83.6 mL·cm-3. Of note, myocardial18F-flurpiridaz uptake (%ID/g) was significantly correlated with K1at rest and following pharmacological vasodilation for all time intervals assessed. However, while Spearman's coefficients (rs) ranged between 0.478 and 0.681, R2values were generally low. In contrast, an excellent correlation of myocardial18F-flurpiridaz uptake with VTwas obtained, particularly when employing the averaged myocardial uptake from 20 to 40 min post tracer injection (R2≥ 0.98). Notably, K1and VTwere similarly sensitive to pharmacological vasodilation induction. Further, mean stress-to-rest ratios of K1, VT, and %ID/g18F-flurpiridaz were virtually identical, suggesting that %ID/g18F-flurpiridaz can be used to estimate coronary flow reserve (CFR) in mice.

Conclusion: Our findings suggest that a simplified assessment of relative myocardial perfusion and CFR, based on image-derived tracer uptake, is feasible with18F-flurpiridaz in mice, enabling high-throughput mechanistic CFR studies in rodents.

JOURNAL: Biomolecules

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Tau aggregates accumulate in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain according to the established Braak staging scheme and spread from transentorhinal over limbic regions to the neocortex. To impact the management of AD patients, an in vivo tool for tau Braak staging is needed. First-generation tau tracers have limited performance in detecting early stages of tau. Therefore, we tested the corresponding capability of the next-generation tau tracer,18F-PI-2620. We analyzed18F-PI-2620 multicenter PET data from 37 beta-amyloid-positive AD dementia patients and those from 26 healthy controls. We applied kinetic modeling of the 0-60 min p.i. PET data using MRTM2 with the lower cerebellum as the reference region to extract Braak stage-dependent distribution volume ratios, whereas controls were used to define Braak stage PET positivity thresholds. Stage-dependent PET positivity widely followed the Braak scheme (except Braak stage III) presenting descending frequency of PET positivity from Braak I (43%), II (38%), III (49%), IV (35%), V (30%) to VI (14%). A strictly hierarchical model was met by 64% of AD dementia cases. Nineteen percent showed a hippocampal sparing tauopathy pattern. Thus, we could assign 87% to the six-stage hierarchical Braak model including tauopathy variants.18F-PI-2620 PET appears to be able to perform Braak tau staging of AD in vivo.

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
The liver is the central metabolic organ. It constantly adapts its metabolic capacity to current physiological requirements. However, the relationship between tissue structure and hepatic function is incompletely understood; this results in a lack of diagnostic markers in medical imaging that can provide information about the liver's metabolic capacity. Therefore, using normal rabbit livers, we combined magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) with proteomics-based kinetic modeling of central liver metabolism to investigate the potential role of MRE for predicting the liver's metabolic functionin vivo. Nineteen New Zealand white rabbits were investigated by multifrequency MRE and positron emission tomography (PET). This yielded maps of shear wave speed (SWS), penetration rate (PR) and standardized uptake value (SUV). Proteomic analysis was performed after the scans. Hepatic metabolic functions were assessed on the basis of the HEPATOKIN1 model in combination with a model of hepatic lipid-droplet metabolism using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Our results showed marked differences between individual livers in both metabolic functions and stiffness properties, though not in SUV. When livers were divided into 'stiff' and 'soft' subgroups (cutoff SWS = 1.6 m/s), stiff livers showed a lower capacity for triacylglycerol storage, while at the same time showing an increased capacity for gluconeogenesis and cholesterol synthesis. Furthermore, SWS was correlated with gluconeogenesis and PR with urea production and glutamine exchange. In conclusion, our study indicates a close relationship between the viscoelastic properties of the liver and metabolic function. This could be used in future studies to predict non-invasively the functional reserve capacity of the liver in patients.

ABSTRACT:
Conventional whole-body static18F-FDG PET imaging provides a semiquantitative evaluation of overall glucose metabolism without insight into the specific transport and metabolic steps. Here we demonstrate the ability of total-body multiparametric18F-FDG PET to quantitatively evaluate glucose metabolism using macroparametric quantification and assess specific glucose delivery and phosphorylation processes using microparametric quantification for studying recovery from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).Methods:The study included 13 healthy subjects and 12 recovering COVID-19 subjects within 8 wk of confirmed diagnosis. Each subject had a 1-h dynamic18F-FDG scan on the uEXPLORER total-body PET/CT system. Semiquantitative SUV and the SUV ratio relative to blood (SUVR) were calculated for different organs to measure glucose utilization. Tracer kinetic modeling was performed to quantify the microparametric blood-to-tissue18F-FDG delivery rate [Formula: see text] and the phosphorylation ratek3, as well as the macroparametric18F-FDG net influx rate ([Formula: see text]). Statistical tests were performed to examine differences between healthy subjects and recovering COVID-19 subjects. The effect of COVID-19 vaccination was also investigated.Results:We detected no significant difference in lung SUV but significantly higher lung SUVR and [Formula: see text] in COVID-19 recovery, indicating improved sensitivity of kinetic quantification for detecting the difference in glucose metabolism. A significant difference was also observed in the lungs with the phosphorylation ratek3but not with [Formula: see text], which suggests that glucose phosphorylation, rather than glucose delivery, drives the observed difference of glucose metabolism. Meanwhile, there was no or little difference in bone marrow18F-FDG metabolism measured with SUV, SUVR, and [Formula: see text] but a significantly higher bone marrow [Formula: see text] in the COVID-19 group, suggesting a difference in glucose delivery. Vaccinated COVID-19 subjects had a lower lung [Formula: see text] and a higher spleen [Formula: see text] than unvaccinated COVID-19 subjects.Conclusion:Higher lung glucose metabolism and bone marrow glucose delivery were observed with total-body multiparametric18F-FDG PET in recovering COVID-19 subjects than in healthy subjects, implying continued inflammation during recovery. Vaccination demonstrated potential protection effects. Total-body multiparametric PET of18F-FDG can provide a more sensitive tool and more insights than conventional whole-body static18F-FDG imaging to evaluate metabolic changes in systemic diseases such as COVID-19.

JOURNAL: Biotechnology and bioengineering

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Cutinases can play a significant role in a biotechnology-based circular economy. However, relatively little is known about the structure-function relationship of these enzymes, knowledge that is vital to advance optimized, engineered enzyme candidates. Here, two almost identical cutinases from Thermobifida cellulosilytica DSM44535 (Thc_Cut1 and Thc_Cut2) with only 18 amino acids difference were used for a rigorous biochemical characterization of their ability to hydrolyze poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), PET-model substrates, and cutin-model substrates. Kinetic parameters were compared with detailed in silico docking studies of enzyme-ligand interactions. The two enzymes interacted with, and hydrolyzed PET differently, with Thc_Cut1 generating smaller PET-degradation products. Thc_Cut1 also showed higher catalytic efficiency on long-chain aliphatic substrates, an effect likely caused by small changes in the binding architecture. Thc_Cut2, in contrast, showed improved binding and catalytic efficiency when approaching the glass transition temperature of PET, an effect likely caused by longer amino acid residues in one area at the enzyme's surface. Finally, the position of the single residue Q93 close to the active site, rotated out in Thc_Cut2, influenced the ligand position of a trimeric PET-model substrate. In conclusion, we illustrate that even minor sequence differences in cutinases can affect their substrate binding, substrate specificity, and catalytic efficiency drastically.

ABSTRACT:
Compartmental modeling analysis of11C-raclopride (RAC) PET data can be used to measure the dopaminergic response to intra-scan behavioral tasks. Bias in estimates of binding potential (BPND) and its dynamic changes (ΔBPND) can arise both when head motion is present and when the compartmental model used for parameter estimation deviates from the underlying biology. The purpose of this study was to characterize the effects of motion and model bias within the context of a behavioral task challenge, examining the impacts of different mitigation strategies. Seventy healthy adults were administered bolus plus constant infusion RAC during a simultaneous PET/magnetic resonance (MR) scan with a reward task experiment. BPNDand ΔBPNDwere estimated using an extension of the Multilinear Reference Tissue Model (E-MRTM2) and a new method (DE-MRTM2) was proposed to selectively discount the contribution of the initial uptake period. Motion was effectively corrected with a standard frame-based approach, which performed equivalently to a more complex reconstruction-based approach. DE-MRTM2 produced estimates of ΔBPNDin putamen and nucleus accumbens that were significantly different from those estimated from E-MRTM2, while also decoupling ΔBPNDvalues from first-pass k2' estimation and removing skew in the spatial bias distribution of parametric ΔBPNDestimates within the striatum.

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Previous SPECT and PET semi-quantitative in vivo imaging studies in monkeys have demonstrated specific uptake of radiolabeled rhesus recombinant anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody fragment CD4R1-F(ab΄)2in the spleen and clusters of lymph nodes (LNs) but yielded conflicting results of imaging the gut CD4 + T-cell pool. Here, using PET dynamic imaging with kinetic analysis, we performed a fully quantitative CD4 imaging in rhesus macaques.

Methods: The biodistributions of [89Zr]Zr-CD4R1-F(ab΄)2and/or of [89Zr]Zr-ibalizumab were performed with static PET scans up to 144 h (6 days) post-injection in 18 rhesus macaques with peripheral blood CD4 + T cells/μl ranging from ~ 20 to 2400. Fully quantitative analysis with a 4-h dynamic scan, arterial sampling, metabolite evaluation, and model fitting was performed in three immunocompetent monkeys to estimate the binding potential of CD4 receptors in the LNs, spleen, and gut.

Results: The biodistributions of [89Zr]Zr-CD4R1-F(ab΄)2and [89Zr]Zr-ibalizumab were similar in lymphoid tissues with a clear delineation of the CD4 pool in the LNs and spleen and a significant difference in lymphoid tissue uptake between immunocompetent and immunocompromised macaques. Consistent with our previous SPECT imaging of [99mTc]Tc-CD4R1-F(ab΄)2, the [89Zr]Zr-CD4R1-F(ab΄)2and [89Zr]Zr-Ibalizumab uptakes in the gut were low and not different between uninfected and SIV-infected CD4-depleted monkeys. Ex vivo studies of large and small intestines confirmed the in vivo images.

Conclusion: The majority of specific binding to CD4 + tissue was localized to LNs and spleen with minimal uptake in the gut. Binding potential derived from fully quantitative studies revealed that the contribution of the gut is lower than the spleen's contribution to the total body CD4 pool.

TITLE: Accurate image derived input function in [18F]SynVesT-1 mouse studies using isoflurane and ketamine/xylazine anesthesia

AUTHORS: Alan Miranda, Daniele Bertoglio, Steven Staelens, Jeroen Verhaeghe

JOURNAL: EJNMMI physics

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Background: Kinetic modeling in positron emission tomography (PET) requires measurement of the tracer plasma activity in the absence of a suitable reference region. To avoid invasive blood sampling, the use of an image derived input function has been proposed. However, an accurate delineation of the blood pool region in the PET image is necessary to obtain unbiased blood activity. Here, to perform brain kinetic modeling in [18F]SynVesT-1 dynamic scans, we make use of non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to unmix the activity signal from the different tissues that can contribute to the heart region activity, and extract only the left ventricle activity in an unbiased way. This method was implemented in dynamic [18F]SynVesT-1 scans of mice anesthetized with either isoflurane or ketamine-xylazine, two anesthestics that we showed to affect differently radiotracer kinetics. The left ventricle activity (NMF-IDIF) and a manually delineated cardiac activity (IDIF) were compared with arterial blood samples (ABS), and for isoflurane anesthetized mice, arteriovenous (AV) shunt blood data were compared as well. Finally, brain regional 2 tissue compartment modeling was performed using IDIF and NMF-IDIF, and the model fit accuracy (weighted symmetrical mean absolute percentage error, wsMAPE) as well as the total volume of distribution (VT) were compared.

Results: In isoflurane anesthetized mice, the difference between ABS and NMF-IDIF activity (+ 12.8 [Formula: see text] 11%, p = 0.0023) was smaller than with IDIF (+ 16.4 [Formula: see text] 9.8%, p = 0.0008). For ketamine-xylazine anesthetized mice the reduction in difference was larger (NMF-IDIF: 16.9 [Formula: see text] 10%, p = 0.0057, IDIF: 56.3 [Formula: see text] 14%, p < 0.0001). Correlation coefficient between isoflurane AV-shunt time activity curves and NMF-IDIF (0.97 [Formula: see text] 0.01) was higher than with IDIF (0.94 [Formula: see text] 0.03). The brain regional 2TCM wsMAPE was improved using NMF-IDIF compared with IDIF, in isoflurane (NMF-IDIF: 1.24 [Formula: see text] 0.24%, IDIF: 1.56 [Formula: see text] 0.30%) and ketamine-xylazine (NMF-IDIF: 1.40 [Formula: see text] 0.24, IDIF: 2.62 [Formula: see text] 0.27) anesthetized mice. Finally, brain VTwas significantly (p < 0.0001) higher using NMF-IDIF compared with IDIF, in isoflurane (3.97 [Formula: see text] 0.13% higher) and ketamine-xylazine (32.7 [Formula: see text] 2.4% higher) anesthetized mice.

Conclusions: Image derived left ventricle blood activity calculated with NMF improves absolute activity quantification, and reduces the error in the kinetic modeling fit. These improvements are more pronounced in ketamine-xylazine than in isoflurane anesthetized mice.

JOURNAL: Frontiers in medicine

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Purpose:The aim of this study was to assess the value of the FDOPA PET kinetic parameters extracted using full kinetic analysis for tumor grading with neuronavigation-guided biopsies as reference in patients with newly-diagnosed gliomas.Methods:Fourteen patients with untreated gliomas were investigated. Twenty minutes of dynamic positron-emission tomography (PET) imaging and a 20-min static image 10 min after injection were reconstructed from a 40-min list-mode acquisition immediately after FDOPA injection. Tumors volume-of-interest (VOI) were generated based on the MRI-guided brain biopsies. Static parameters (TBRmax and TBRmean) and kinetic parameters [K1 and k2 using full kinetic analysis with the reversible single-tissue compartment model with blood volume parameter and the time-to-peak (TTP)] were extracted. Performances of each parameter for differentiating low-grade gliomas (LGG) from high-grade gliomas (HGG) were evaluated by receiver-operating characteristic analyses (area under the curve; AUC).Results:Thirty-two tumoral VOI were analyzed. K1, k2, and TTP were significantly higher for HGG than for LGG (median K1-value = 0.124 vs. 0.074 ml/ccm/min,p= 0.025, median k2-value = 0.093 vs. 0.063 min-1,p= 0.025, and median TTP-value = 10.0 vs. 15.0 min,p= 0.025). No significant difference was observed for the static parameters. The AUC for the kinetic parameters was higher than the AUC for the static parameters (respectively, AUCK1= 0.787, AUCk2= 0.785, AUCTTP= 0.775, AUCTBRmax= 0.551, AUCTBRmean= 0.575), significantly compared to TBRmax (respectively,p= 0.001 for K1,p= 0.031 for k2, andp= 0.029 for TTP).Conclusion:The present study suggests an additive value of FDOPA PET/CT kinetic parameters for newly-diagnosed gliomas grading.

TITLE: Unsupervised PET logan parametric image estimation using conditional deep image prior

AUTHORS: Jianan Cui, Kuang Gong, Ning Guo, Kyungsang Kim, Huafeng Liu, Quanzheng Li

JOURNAL: Medical image analysis

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Recently, deep learning-based denoising methods have been gradually used for PET images denoising and have shown great achievements. Among these methods, one interesting framework is conditional deep image prior (CDIP) which is an unsupervised method that does not need prior training or a large number of training pairs. In this work, we combined CDIP with Logan parametric image estimation to generate high-quality parametric images. In our method, the kinetic model is the Logan reference tissue model that can avoid arterial sampling. The neural network was utilized to represent the images of Logan slope and intercept. The patient's computed tomography (CT) image or magnetic resonance (MR) image was used as the network input to provide anatomical information. The optimization function was constructed and solved by the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm. Both simulation and clinical patient datasets demonstrated that the proposed method could generate parametric images with more detailed structures. Quantification results showed that the proposed method results had higher contrast-to-noise (CNR) improvement ratios (PET/CT datasets: 62.25%±29.93%; striatum of brain PET datasets : 129.51%±32.13%, thalamus of brain PET datasets: 128.24%±31.18%) than Gaussian filtered results (PET/CT datasets: 23.33%±18.63%; striatum of brain PET datasets: 74.71%±8.71%, thalamus of brain PET datasets: 73.02%±9.34%) and nonlocal mean (NLM) denoised results (PET/CT datasets: 37.55%±26.56%; striatum of brain PET datasets: 100.89%±16.13%, thalamus of brain PET datasets: 103.59%±16.37%).

ABSTRACT:
Synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A) is ubiquitously expressed in presynaptic terminals where it functions as a neurotransmission regulator protein. Synaptopathy has been reported during healthy ageing and in a variety of neurodegenerative diseases. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of SV2A can be used to evaluate synaptic density. The PET ligand [11C]UCB-J has high binding affinity and selectivity for SV2A but has a short physical half-life due to the11C isotope. Here we report the characterization and validation of its18F-labeled equivalent, [18F]UCB-J, in terms of specificity, reproducibility and stability in C57BL/6J mice. Plasma analysis revealed at least one polar radiometabolite. Kinetic modelling was performed using a population-based metabolite corrected image-derived input function (IDIF). [18F]UCB-J showed relatively fast kinetics and a reliable measure of the IDIF-based volume of distribution (VT(IDIF)). [18F]UCB-J specificity for SV2A was confirmed through a levetiracetam blocking assay (50 to 200 mg/kg). Reproducibility of theVT(IDIF)was determined through test-retest analysis, revealing significant correlation (r2= 0.773,p< 0.0001). Time-stability analyses indicate a scan duration of 60 min to be sufficient to obtain a reliableVT(IDIF). In conclusion, [18F]UCB-J is a selective SV2A ligand with optimal kinetics in mice. Further investigation is warranted for (pre)clinical applicability of [18F]UCB-J in synaptopathies.

ABSTRACT:
Evaluating in vivo the metabolic rates of the human liver has been a challenge due to its unique perfusion system. Positron emission tomography (PET) represents the current gold standard for assessing non-invasively tissue metabolic rates in vivo. Here, we review the existing literature on the assessment of hepatic metabolism, haemodynamics and cancer with PET. The tracer mainly used in metabolic studies has been [18F]2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (18F-FDG). Its application not only enables the evaluation of hepatic glucose uptake in a variety of metabolic conditions and interventions, but based on the kinetics of18F-FDG, endogenous glucose production can also be assessed. 14(R,S)-[18F]fluoro-6-thia-Heptadecanoic acid (18F-FTHA),11C-Palmitate and11C-Acetate have also been applied for the assessment of hepatic fatty acid uptake rates (18F-FTHA and11C-Palmitate) and blood flow and oxidation (11C-Acetate). Oxygen-15 labelled water (15O-H2O) has been used for the quantification of hepatic perfusion.18F-FDG is also the most common tracer used for hepatic cancer diagnostics, whereas11C-Acetate has also shown some promising applications in imaging liver malignancies. The modelling approaches used to analyse PET data and also the challenges in utilizing PET in the assessment of hepatic metabolism are presented.

TITLE: (+)-[18F]Flubatine as a novel α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor PET ligand-results of the first-in-human brain imaging application in patients with β-amyloid PET-confirmed Alzheimer's disease and healthy controls

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Purposes: We present the first in-human brain PET imaging data of the new α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR)-targeting radioligand (+)-[18F]Flubatine. Aims were to develop a kinetic modeling-based approach to quantify (+)-[18F]Flubatine and compare the data of healthy controls (HCs) and patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD); to investigate the partial volume effect (PVE) on regional (+)-[18F]Flubatine binding; and whether (+)-[18F]Flubatine binding and cognitive test data respective β-amyloid radiotracer accumulation were correlated.

Methods: We examined 11 HCs and 9 mild AD patients. All subjects underwent neuropsychological testing and [11C]PiB PET/MRI examination. (+)-[18F]Flubatine PET data were evaluated using full kinetic modeling and regional as well as voxel-based analyses.

Results: With 270-min p.i., the unchanged parent compound amounted to 97 ± 2%. Adequate fits of the time-activity curves were obtained with the 1 tissue compartment model (1TCM). (+)-[18F]Flubatine distribution volume (binding) was significantly reduced in bilateral mesial temporal cortex in AD patients compared with HCs (right 10.6 ± 1.1 vs 11.6 ± 1.4, p = 0.049; left 11.0 ± 1.1 vs 12.2 ± 1.8, p = 0.046; one-sided t tests each). PVE correction increased not only (+)-[18F]Flubatine binding of approximately 15% but also standard deviation of 0.4-70%. Cognitive test data and (+)-[18F]Flubatine binding were significantly correlated in the left anterior cingulate, right posterior cingulate, and right parietal cortex (r > 0.5, p < 0.05 each). In AD patients, (+)-[18F]Flubatine binding and [11C]PiB standardized uptake value ratios were negatively correlated in several regions; whereas in HCs, a positive correlation between cortical (+)-[18F]Flubatine binding and [11C]PiB accumulation in the white matter was found. No adverse event related to (+)-[18F]Flubatine occurred.

Conclusion: (+)-[18F]Flubatine is a safe and stable PET ligand. Full kinetic modeling can be realized by 1TCM without metabolite correction. (+)-[18F]Flubatine binding affinity was high enough to detect group differences. Of interest, correlation between white matter β-amyloid PET uptake and (+)-[18F]Flubatine binding indicated an association between white matter integrity and availability of α4β2 nAChRs. Overall, (+)-[18F]Flubatine showed favorable characteristics and has therefore the potential to serve as α4β2 nAChR-targeting PET ligand in further clinical trials.

ABSTRACT:
PET imaging of synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A allows for noninvasive quantification of synapses. This first-in-human study aimed to evaluate the kinetics, test-retest reproducibility, and extent of specific binding of a recently developed synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A PET ligand, (R)-4-(3-(18F-fluoro)phenyl)-1-((3-methylpyridin-4-yl)methyl)pyrrolidine-2-one (18F-SynVesT-2), with fast brain kinetics.Methods:Nine healthy volunteers participated in this study and were scanned on a High Resolution Research Tomograph scanner with18F-SynVesT-2. Five volunteers were scanned twice on 2 different days. Five volunteers were rescanned with preinjected levetiracetam (20 mg/kg, intravenously). Arterial blood was collected to calculate the plasma free fraction and generate the arterial input function. Individual MR images were coregistered to a brain atlas to define regions of interest for generating time-activity curves, which were fitted with 1- and 2-tissue-compartment (1TC and 2TC) models to derive the regional distribution volume (VT). The regional nondisplaceable binding potential (BPND) was calculated from 1TCVT, using the centrum semiovale (CS) as the reference region.Results:18F-SynVesT-2 was synthesized with high molar activity (187 ± 69 MBq/nmol,n= 19). The parent fraction of18F-SynVesT-2 in plasma was 28% ± 8% at 30 min after injection, and the plasma free fraction was high (0.29 ± 0.04).18F-SynVesT-2 entered the brain quickly, with an SUVpeakof 8 within 10 min after injection. Regional time-activity curves fitted well with both the 1TC and the 2TC models; however,VTwas estimated more reliably using the 1TC model. The 1TCVTranged from 1.9 ± 0.2 mL/cm3in CS to 7.6 ± 0.8 mL/cm3in the putamen, with low absolute test-retest variability (6.0% ± 3.6%). RegionalBPNDranged from 1.76 ± 0.21 in the hippocampus to 3.06 ± 0.29 in the putamen. A 20-min scan was sufficient to provide reliableVTandBPNDConclusion:18F-SynVesT-2 has fast kinetics, high specific uptake, and low nonspecific uptake in the brain. Consistent with the nonhuman primate results, the kinetics of18F-SynVesT-2 is faster than the kinetics of11C-UCB-J and18F-SynVesT-1 in the human brain and enables a shorter dynamic scan to derive physiologic information on cerebral blood flow and synapse density.

TITLE: Designing drug occupancy studies with PET neuroimaging: Sample size, occupancy ranges and analytical methods

AUTHORS: Gjertrud Louise Laurell, Pontus Plavén-Sigray, Claus Svarer, R Todd Ogden, Gitte Moos Knudsen, Martin Schain

JOURNAL: NeuroImage

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Molecular neuroimaging is today considered essential for evaluation of novel CNS drugs; it is used to quantify blood-brain barrier permeability, verify interaction with key target and determine the drug dose resulting in 50% occupancy, IC50. In spite of this, there has been limited data available to inform on how to optimize study designs. Through simulations, we here evaluate how IC50estimation is affected by the (i) range of drug doses administered, (ii) number of subjects included, and (iii) level of noise in the plasma drug concentration measurements. Receptor occupancy is determined from PET distribution volumes using two different methods: the Lassen plot and Likelihood estimation of occupancy (LEO). We also introduce and evaluate a new likelihood-based estimator for direct estimation of IC50from PET distribution volumes. For estimation of IC50, we find very limited added benefit in scanning individuals who are given drug doses corresponding to less than 40% receptor occupancy. In the range of typical PET sample sizes (5-20 subjects) each extra individual clearly reduces the error of the IC50estimate. In all simulations, likelihood-based methods gave more precise IC50estimates than the Lassen plot; four times the number of subjects were required for the Lassen plot to reach the same IC50precision as LEO.

TITLE: Inverse Modeling of Thermal Decomposition of Flame-Retardant PET Fiber with Model-Free Coupled with Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm

AUTHORS: Junxiang Wang, Xuan Zhao, Qiang Yu, Chen Zhao

JOURNAL: ACS omega

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
The thermal decomposition model of flame-retardant polyethylene terephthalate (FRPET) fiber is essential for predicting its fire behavior and do relevant fire simulation. In this work, the thermal decomposition character of FRPET is investigated via thermogravimetric analysis at four heating rates. Two kinetic schemes are proposed based on the analysis of experimental data and model-free methods. The model-free methods (Friedman and advanced Vyazovkin methods) are employed to determine possible search range for particle swarm optimization algorithm with constriction factor (CFPSO). Thus, this coupled method could evaluate the kinetic parameters for two proposed schemes without initial guess. Both models could reasonably predict the experimental data with obtained parameters, and the second two-step consecutive model shows better performance. The performance of CFPSO on the second model is further compared with improved generalized simulated annealing algorithm, and CFPSO was found to be more effective. Furthermore, global sensitivity analysis was conducted via the Sobol method to investigate the influence of kinetic parameters for the second model on predicted results. The most influential parameters are lnAandEαof the second reaction and reaction ordernof the third reaction.

TITLE: 18F-Fluciclovine PET Imaging of Glutaminase Inhibition in Breast Cancer Models

AUTHORS: Rong Zhou, Hoon Choi, Jianbo Cao, Austin Pantel, Mamta Gupta, Hsiaoju S Lee, David Mankoff

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Aggressive cancers such as triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) avidly metabolize glutamine as a feature of their malignant phenotype. The conversion of glutamine to glutamate by the glutaminase enzyme represents the first and rate-limiting step of this pathway and a target for drug development. Indeed, a novel glutaminase inhibitor (GLSi) has been developed and tested in clinical trials but with limited success, suggesting the potential for a biomarker to select patients who could benefit from this novel therapy. Here, we studied a nonmetabolized amino acid analog,18F-fluciclovine, as a PET imaging biomarker for detecting the pharmacodynamic response to GLSi.Methods:Uptake of18F-fluciclovine into human breast cancer cells was studied in the presence and absence of inhibitors of glutamine transporters and GLSi. To allow18F-fluciclovine PET to be performed on mice, citrate in the tracer formulation is replaced by phosphate-buffered saline. Mice bearing triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) xenografts (HCC38, HCC1806, and MBA-MD-231) and estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer xenografts (MCF-7) were imaged with dynamic PET at baseline and after a 2-d treatment of GLSi (CB839) or vehicle. Kinetic analysis suggested reversible uptake of the tracer, and the distribution volume (VD) of18F-fluciclovine was estimated by Logan plot analysis.Results:Our data showed that cellular uptake of18F-fluciclovine is mediated by glutamine transporters. A significant increase in VDwas observed after CB839 treatment in TNBC models exhibiting high glutaminase activity (HCC38 and HCC1806) but not in TNBC or MCF-7 exhibiting low glutaminase. Changes in VDwere corroborated with changes in GLS activity measured in tumors treated with CB839 versus vehicle, as well as with changes in VDof18F-(2S,R4)-fluoroglutamine, which we previously validated as a measure of cellular glutamine pool size. A moderate, albeit significant, decrease in18F-FDG PET signal was observed in HCC1806 tumors after CB839 treatment.Conclusion:18F-fluciclovine PET has potential to serve as a clinically translatable pharmacodynamic biomarker of GLSi.

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: To investigate the kinetics of18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) by positron emission tomography (PET) in multiple organs and test the feasibility of total-body parametric imaging using an image-derived input function (IDIF).

Methods: Twenty-four oncological patients underwent dynamic18F-FDG scans lasting 65 min using a long axial FOV (LAFOV) PET/CT system. Time activity curves (TAC) were extracted from semi-automated segmentations of multiple organs, cerebral grey and white matter, and from vascular structures. The tissue and tumor lesion TACs were fitted using an irreversible two-tissue compartment (2TC) and a Patlak model. Parametric images were also generated using direct and indirect Patlak methods and their performances were evaluated.

Results: We report estimates of kinetic parameters and metabolic rate of glucose consumption (MRFDG) for different organs and tumor lesions. In some organs, there were significant differences between MRFDGvalues estimated using 2TC and Patlak models. No statistically significant difference was seen between MRFDGvalues estimated using 2TC and Patlak methods in tumor lesions (paired t-test, P = 0.65). Parametric imaging showed that net influx (Ki) images generated using direct and indirect Patlak methods had superior tumor-to-background ratio (TBR) to standard uptake value (SUV) images (3.1- and 3.0-fold mean increases in TBRmean, respectively). Influx images generated using the direct Patlak method had twofold higher contrast-to-noise ratio in tumor lesions compared to images generated using the indirect Patlak method.

Conclusion: We performed pharmacokinetic modelling of multiple organs using linear and non-linear models using dynamic total-body18F-FDG images. Although parametric images did not reveal more tumors than SUV images, the results confirmed that parametric imaging furnishes improved tumor contrast. We thus demonstrate the feasibility of total-body kinetic modelling and parametric imaging in basic research and oncological studies. LAFOV PET can enhance dynamic imaging capabilities by providing high sensitivity parametric images and allowing total-body pharmacokinetic analysis.

TITLE: Multiparametric cardiac18F-FDG PET in humans: pilot comparison of FDG delivery rate with82Rb myocardial blood flow

AUTHORS: Yang Zuo, Javier E López, Thomas W Smith, Cameron C Foster, Richard E Carson, Ramsey D Badawi, Guobao Wang

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Myocardial blood flow (MBF) and flow reserve are usually quantified in the clinic with positron emission tomography (PET) using a perfusion-specific radiotracer (e.g.82Rb-chloride). However, the clinical accessibility of existing perfusion tracers remains limited. Meanwhile,18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is a commonly used radiotracer for PET metabolic imaging without similar limitations. In this paper, we explore the potential of18F-FDG for myocardial perfusion imaging by comparing the myocardial FDG delivery rateK1with MBF as determined by dynamic82Rb PET in fourteen human subjects with heart disease. Two sets of FDGK1were derived from one-hour dynamic FDG scans. One was the original FDGK1estimates and the other was the correspondingK1values that were linearly normalized for blood glucose levels. A generalized Renkin-Crone model was used to fit FDGK1with Rb MBF, which then allowed for a nonlinear extraction fraction correction for converting FDGK1to MBF. The linear correlation between FDG-derived MBF and Rb MBF was moderate (r= 0.79) before the glucose normalization and became much improved (r> 0.9) after glucose normalization. The extraction fraction of FDG was also similar to that of Rb-chloride in the myocardium. The results from this pilot study suggest that dynamic cardiac FDG-PET with tracer kinetic modeling has the potential to provide MBF in addition to its conventional use for metabolic imaging.

ABSTRACT:
In this study, we used a compact, high-resolution, and MRI-compatible PET camera (VersaPET) to assess the feasibility of measuring the image-derived input function (IDIF) from arteries in the leg with the ultimate goal of enabling fully quantitative PET brain imaging without blood sampling. We used this approach in five18F-FDG PET/MRI brain studies in which the input function was also acquired using the gold standard of serial arterial blood sampling. After accounting for partial volume, dispersion, and calibration effects, we compared the metabolic rates of glucose (MRglu) quantified from VersaPET IDIFs in 80 brain regions to those using the gold standard and achieved a bias and variability of <5% which is within the range of reported test-retest values for this type of study. We also achieved a strong linear relationship (R2>0.97) against the gold standard across regions. The results of this preliminary study are promising and support further studies to optimize methods, validate in a larger cohort, and extend to the modeling of other radiotracers.

TITLE: Textural properties of microglial activation in Alzheimer's disease as measured by (R)-[11C]PK11195 PET

AUTHORS: Marta Lapo Pais, Lília Jorge, Ricardo Martins, Nádia Canário, Ana Carolina Xavier, Rui Bernardes, Antero Abrunhosa, Isabel Santana, Miguel Castelo-Branco

JOURNAL: Brain communications

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia worldwide, accounting for 60-70% of diagnosed cases. According to the current understanding of molecular pathogenesis, the main hallmarks of this disease are the abnormal accumulation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Therefore, biomarkers reflecting these underlying biological mechanisms are recognized as valid tools for an early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. Inflammatory mechanisms, such as microglial activation, are known to be involved in Alzheimer's disease onset and progression. This activated state of the microglia is associated with increased expression of the translocator protein 18 kDa. On that account, PET tracers capable of measuring this signature, such as (R)-[11C]PK11195, might be instrumental in assessing the state and evolution of Alzheimer's disease. This study aims to investigate the potential of Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix-based textural parameters as an alternative to conventional quantification using kinetic models in (R)-[11C]PK11195 PET images. To achieve this goal, kinetic and textural parameters were computed on (R)-[11C]PK11195 PET images of 19 patients with an early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and 21 healthy controls and submitted separately to classification using a linear support vector machine. The classifier built using the textural parameters showed no inferior performance compared to the classical kinetic approach, yielding a slightly larger classification accuracy (accuracy of 0.7000, sensitivity of 0.6957, specificity of 0.7059 and balanced accuracy of 0.6967). In conclusion, our results support the notion that textural parameters may be an alternative to conventional quantification using kinetic models in (R)-[11C]PK11195 PET images. The proposed quantification method makes it possible to use simpler scanning procedures, which increase patient comfort and convenience. We further speculate that textural parameters may also provide an alternative to kinetic analysis in (R)-[11C]PK11195 PET neuroimaging studies involving other neurodegenerative disorders. Finally, we recognize that the potential role of this tracer is not in diagnosis but rather in the assessment and progression of the diffuse and dynamic distribution of inflammatory cell density in this disorder as a promising therapeutic target.

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Loss of neuronal synapse function is associated with a number of brain disorders. The [11C]UCB-J positron emission tomography (PET) tracer allows for in vivo examination of synaptic density, as it binds to synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A) expressed in presynaptic terminals. Here, we characterise [11C]UCB-J imaging in Göttingen minipigs.

Procedures: Using PET imaging, we examined tracer specificity and compared kinetic models. We explored the use of a standard blood curve and centrum semiovale white matter as a reference region. We compared in vivo [11C]UCB-J PET imaging to in vitro autoradiography, Western blotting and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction.

Results: The uptake kinetics of [11C]UCB-J could be described using a 1-tissue compartment model and blocking of SV2A availability with levetiracetam showed dose-dependent specific binding. Population-based blood curves resulted in reliable [11C]UCB-J binding estimates, while it was not possible to use centrum semiovale white matter as a non-specific reference region. Brain [11C]UCB-J PET signals correlated well with [3H]UCB-J autoradiography and SV2A protein levels.

Conclusions: [11C]UCB-J PET is a valid in vivo marker of synaptic density in the minipig brain, with binding values close to those reported for humans. Minipig models of disease could be valuable for investigating the efficacy of putative neuroprotective agents for preserving synaptic function in future non-invasive, longitudinal studies.

AUTHORS: Emily Nicole Holy, Elizabeth Li, Anjan Bhattarai, Evan Fletcher, Evelyn R Alfaro, Danielle J Harvey, Benjamin A Spencer, Simon R Cherry, Charles S DeCarli, Audrey P Fan

JOURNAL: EJNMMI research

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Background: Kinetic modeling of18F-florbetaben provides important quantification of brain amyloid deposition in research and clinical settings but its use is limited by the requirement of arterial blood data for quantitative PET. The total-body EXPLORER PET scanner supports the dynamic acquisition of a full human body simultaneously and permits noninvasive image-derived input functions (IDIFs) as an alternative to arterial blood sampling. This study quantified brain amyloid burden with kinetic modeling, leveraging dynamic18F-florbetaben PET in aorta IDIFs and the brain in an elderly cohort.

Methods: 18F-florbetaben dynamic PET imaging was performed on the EXPLORER system with tracer injection (300 MBq) in 3 individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD), 3 with mild cognitive impairment, and 9 healthy controls. Image-derived input functions were extracted from the descending aorta with manual regions of interest based on the first 30 s after injection. Dynamic time-activity curves (TACs) for 110 min were fitted to the two-tissue compartment model (2TCM) using population-based metabolite corrected IDIFs to calculate total and specific distribution volumes (VT, Vs) in key brain regions with early amyloid accumulation. Non-displaceable binding potential ([Formula: see text] was also calculated from the multi-reference tissue model (MRTM).

Results: Amyloid-positive (AD) patients showed the highest VTand VSin anterior cingulate, posterior cingulate, and precuneus, consistent with [Formula: see text] analysis. [Formula: see text]and VTfrom kinetic models were correlated (r² = 0.46, P < 2[Formula: see text] with a stronger positive correlation observed in amyloid-positive participants, indicating reliable model fits with the IDIFs. VTfrom 2TCM was highly correlated ([Formula: see text]= 0.65, P < 2[Formula: see text]) with Logan graphical VTestimation.

Conclusion: Non-invasive quantification of amyloid binding from total-body18F-florbetaben PET data is feasible using aorta IDIFs with high agreement between kinetic distribution volume parameters compared to [Formula: see text]in amyloid-positive and amyloid-negative older individuals.

ABSTRACT:
With the majority of CD8+T cells residing and functioning in tissue, not blood, developing noninvasive methods forin vivoquantification of their biodistribution and kinetics in humans offers the means for studying their key role in adaptive immune response and memory. This study is the first report on using positron emission tomography (PET) dynamic imaging and compartmental kinetic modeling forin vivomeasurement of whole-body biodistribution of CD8+T cells in human subjects. For this, a89Zr-labeled minibody with high affinity for human CD8 (89Zr-Df-Crefmirlimab) was used with total-body PET in healthy subjects (N=3) and in COVID-19 convalescent patients (N=5). The high detection sensitivity, total-body coverage, and the use of dynamic scans enabled the study of kinetics simultaneously in spleen, bone marrow, liver, lungs, thymus, lymph nodes, and tonsils, at reduced radiation doses compared to prior studies. Analysis and modeling of the kinetics was consistent with T cell trafficking effects expected from immunobiology of lymphoid organs, suggesting early uptake in spleen and bone marrow followed by redistribution and delayed increasing uptake in lymph nodes, tonsils, and thymus. Tissue-to-blood ratios from the first 7 h of CD8-targeted imaging showed significantly higher values in the bone marrow of COVID-19 patients compared to controls, with an increasing trend between 2 and 6 months post-infection, consistent with net influx rates obtained by kinetic modeling and flow cytometry analysis of peripheral blood samples. These results provide the platform for using dynamic PET scans and kinetic modelling to study total-body immunological response and memory.

TITLE: Multiparametric dynamic whole-body PSMA PET/CT using [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 and [18F]PSMA-1007

AUTHORS: André H Dias, Mads R Jochumsen, Helle D Zacho, Ole L Munk, Lars C Gormsen

JOURNAL: EJNMMI research

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Background: Routine prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positron emission tomography (PET) performed for primary staging or restaging of prostate cancer patients is usually done as a single static image acquisition 60 min after tracer administration. In this study, we employ dynamic whole-body (D-WB) PET imaging to compare the pharmacokinetics of [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 and [18F]PSMA-1007 in various tissues and lesions, and to assess whether Patlak parametric images are quantitative and improve lesion detection and image readability.

Methods: Twenty male patients with prostate cancer were examined using a D-WB PSMA PET protocol. Ten patients were scanned with [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 and ten with [18F]PSMA-1007. Kinetic analyses were made using time-activity curves (TACs) extracted from organs (liver, spleen, bone, and muscle) and lesions. For each patient, three images were produced: SUV + Patlak parametric images (Kiand DV). All images were reviewed visually to compare lesion detection, image readability was quantified using target-to-background ratios (TBR), and Ki and DV values were compared.

Results: The two PSMA tracers exhibited markedly different pharmacokinetics in organs: reversible for [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 and irreversible for [18F]PSMA-1007. For both tracers, lesions kinetics were best described by an irreversible model. All parametric images were of good visual quality using both radiotracers. In general, Ki images were characterized by reduced vascular signal and increased lesion TBR compared with SUV images. No additional malignant lesions were identified on the parametric images.

Conclusion: D-WB PET/CT is feasible for both PSMA tracers allowing for direct reconstruction of parametric Ki images. The use of multiparametric PSMA images increased TBR but did not lead to the detection of more lesions. For quantitative whole-body Ki imaging, [18F]PSMA-1007 should be preferred over [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 due to its irreversible kinetics in organs and lesions.

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: F13640 (a.k.a. befiradol, NLX-112) is a highly selective 5-HT1Areceptor ligand that was selected as a PET radiopharmaceutical-candidate based on animal studies. Due to its high efficacy agonist properties, [18F]F13640 binds preferentially to functional 5-HT1Areceptors, which are coupled to intracellular G-proteins. Here, we characterize brain labeling of 5-HT1Areceptors by [18F]F13640 in humans and describe a simplified model for its quantification.

Methods: PET/CT and PET-MRI scans were conducted in a total of 13 healthy male volunteers (29 ± 9 years old), with arterial input functions (AIF) (n = 9) and test-retest protocol (n = 8). Several kinetic models were compared (one tissue compartment model, two-tissue compartment model, and Logan); two models with reference region were also evaluated: simplified reference tissue model (SRTM) and the logan reference model (LREF).

Results: [18F]F13640 showed high uptake values in raphe nuclei and cortical regions. SRTM and LREF models showed a very high correlation with kinetic models using AIF. As concerns test-retest parameters and the prolonged binding kinetics of [18F]F13640, better reproducibility, and reliability were found with the LREF method. Cerebellum white matter and frontal lobe white matter stand out as suitable reference regions.

Conclusion: The favorable brain labeling and kinetic profile of [18F]F13640, its high receptor specificity and its high efficacy agonist properties open new perspectives for studying functionally active 5-HT1Areceptors, unlike previous radiopharmaceuticals that act as antagonists. [18F]F13640's kinetic properties allow injection outside of the PET scanner with delayed acquisitions, facilitating the design of innovative longitudinal protocols in neurology and psychiatry.

ABSTRACT:
Positron Emission Tomography (PET) of the 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO) is critical for neuroinflammation studies but faces substantial methodological challenges. These include issues with arterial blood sampling for kinetic modeling, the absence of suitable reference regions, genetic polymorphisms affecting tracer affinity, altered blood-to-brain tracer delivery in inflammatory conditions, and high signal variability. This study presents a novel blood-free reference-free method for TSPO PET quantification, leveraging a logistic regression model to estimate the probability of TSPO overexpression across brain regions. Validation was performed on 323 human brain scans from five datasets and three radiotracers. The quantified TSPO topology in healthy controls showed strong concordance with the constitutive TSPO gene expression for all tracers. When using [11C]PBR28 PET data, the method replicated previous findings in schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, chronic pain, and XBD173 blocking. However, model extension to [18F]DPA-714 and [11C]-(R)-PK11195 revealed small effect sizes and high variability, suggesting the need for tracer-specific model optimization. Finally, validation in a rat model of lipopolysaccharide-induced neuroinflammation confirmed previous evidence of increased brain TSPO uptake after a systemic challenge. This novel non-invasive method provides individualized TSPO PET quantification, demonstrating broad applicability across TSPO PET tracers and imaging sites, assuming sufficient training data for model development.

TITLE: In vivo vesicular acetylcholine transporter density in human peripheral organs: an [18F]FEOBV PET/CT study

AUTHORS: Jacob Horsager, Niels Okkels, Nathalie Van Den Berge, Jan Jacobsen, Anna Schact, Ole Lajord Munk, Kim Vang, Dirk Bender, David J Brooks, Per Borghammer

JOURNAL: EJNMMI research

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Background: The autonomic nervous system is frequently affected in some neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease and Dementia with Lewy bodies. In vivo imaging methods to visualize and quantify the peripheral cholinergic nervous system are lacking. By using [18F]FEOBV PET, we here describe the peripheral distribution of the specific cholinergic marker, vesicular acetylcholine transporters (VAChT), in human subjects. We included 15 healthy subjects aged 53-86 years for 70 min dynamic PET protocol of peripheral organs. We performed kinetic modelling of the adrenal gland, pancreas, myocardium, renal cortex, spleen, colon, and muscle using an image-derived input function from the aorta. A metabolite correction model was generated from venous blood samples. Three non-linear compartment models were tested. Additional time-activity curves from 6 to 70 min post injection were generated for prostate, thyroid, submandibular-, parotid-, and lacrimal glands.

Results: A one-tissue compartment model generated the most robust fits to the data. Total volume-of-distribution rank order was: adrenal gland > pancreas > myocardium > spleen > renal cortex > muscle > colon. We found significant linear correlations between total volumes-of-distribution and standard uptake values in most organs.

Conclusion: High [18F]FEOBV PET signal was found in structures with known cholinergic activity. We conclude that [18F]FEOBV PET is a valid tool for estimating VAChT density in human peripheral organs. Simple static images may replace kinetic modeling in some organs and significantly shorten scan duration. Clinical Trial Registration Trial registration: NCT,NCT03554551.

AUTHORS: Linjing Mu, Stefanie D Krämer, Hazem Ahmed, Stefan Gruber, Susanne Geistlich, Roger Schibli, Simon M Ametamey

JOURNAL: Chimia

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Radiopharmacy at ETH has worked on the development of novel PET tracers for neuro-, cardiac- and tumor imaging for many years. In this paper, our efforts on targeting the glutamatergic system of the metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5 (mGluR5) and the ionotropicN-methyl-<small>D</small>-aspartate (NMDA) receptor are summarized. We briefly described the principles of positron emission tomography (PET) tracer development for the central nervous system (CNS) and the radiolabeling methods used in our laboratory. To assess the radioligands, results ofin vitroautoradiography, biodistribution, and metabolite studies as well as PET imaging data are discussed. Furthermore, key PET parameters for kinetic modeling and quantification methods are provided. Two mGluR5 PET tracers, [11C]ABP688 and [18F]PSS232, were translated in our GMP labs and evaluated in human subjects. The newly developed GluN2B PET tracer [11C]Me-NB1 is currently being investigated in a first-in-human PET study and several F-18 labeled tracers are being evaluated in non-human primates in which the first-in-class will be translated for human studies.

JOURNAL: Alzheimer's & dementia (Amsterdam, Netherlands)

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Introduction: Continuous measures of amyloid burden as measured by positron emission tomography (PET) are being used increasingly to stage Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study examined whether cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma amyloid beta (Aβ)42/Aβ40 could predict continuous values for amyloid PET.

Methods: CSF Aβ42 and Aβ40 were measured with automated immunoassays. Plasma Aβ42 and Aβ40 were measured with an immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry assay. Amyloid PET was performed with Pittsburgh compound B (PiB). The continuous relationships of CSF and plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 with amyloid PET burden were modeled.

Results: Most participants were cognitively normal (427 of 491 [87%]) and the mean age was 69.0 ± 8.8 years. CSF Aβ42/Aβ40 predicted amyloid PET burden until a relatively high level of amyloid accumulation (69.8 Centiloids), whereas plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 predicted amyloid PET burden until a lower level (33.4 Centiloids).

Discussion: CSF Aβ42/Aβ40 predicts the continuous level of amyloid plaque burden over a wider range than plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 and may be useful in AD staging.

Highlights: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid beta (Aβ)42/Aβ40 predicts continuous amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) values up to a relatively high burden.Plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 is a comparatively dichotomous measure of brain amyloidosis.Models can predict regional amyloid PET burden based on CSF Aβ42/Aβ40.CSF Aβ42/Aβ40 may be useful in staging AD.

TITLE: Framing protocol optimization in oncological Patlak parametric imaging with uKinetics

AUTHORS: Qing Ye, Hao Zeng, Yizhang Zhao, Weiguang Zhang, Yun Dong, Wei Fan, Yihuan Lu

JOURNAL: EJNMMI physics

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Total-body PET imaging with ultra-high sensitivity makes high-temporal-resolution framing protocols possible for the first time, which allows to capture rapid tracer dynamic changes. However, whether protocols with higher number of temporal frames can justify the efficacy with substantially added computation burden for clinical application remains unclear. We have developed a kinetic modeling software package (uKinetics) with the advantage of practical, fast, and automatic workflow for dynamic total-body studies. The aim of this work is to verify the uKinetics with PMOD and to perform framing protocol optimization for the oncological Patlak parametric imaging.

Methods: Six different protocols with 100, 61, 48, 29, 19 and 12 temporal frames were applied to analyze 60-min dynamic18F-FDG PET scans of 10 patients, respectively. Voxel-based Patlak analysis coupled with automatically extracted image-derived input function was applied to generate parametric images. Normal tissues and lesions were segmented manually or automatically to perform correlation analysis and Bland-Altman plots. Different protocols were compared with the protocol of 100 frames as reference.

Results: Minor differences were found between uKinetics and PMOD in the Patlak parametric imaging. Compared with the protocol with 100 frames, the relative difference of the input function and quantitative kinetic parameters remained low for protocols with at least 29 frames, but increased for the protocols with 19 and 12 frames. Significant difference of lesion Kivalues was found between the protocols with 100 frames and 12 frames.

Conclusion: uKinetics was proved providing equivalent oncological Patlak parametric imaging comparing to PMOD. Minor differences were found between protocols with 100 and 29 frames, which indicated that 29-frame protocol is sufficient and efficient for the oncological18F-FDG Patlak applications, and the protocols with more frames are not needed. The protocol with 19 frames yielded acceptable results, while that with 12 frames is not recommended.

ABSTRACT:
Introduction: Recent evidence suggests the blood-to-brain influx rate () inTSPO PETimaging as a promising biomarker of blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability alterations commonly associated with peripheral inflammation and heightened immune activity in the brain. However, standard compartmental modeling quantification is limited by the requirement of invasive and laborious procedures for extracting an arterial blood input function. In this study, we validate a simplified blood-free methodologic framework forestimation by fitting the early phase tracer dynamics using a single irreversible compartment model and an image-derived input function (1T1K-IDIF).

Methods: The method is tested on a multi-site dataset containing 177PETstudies from twoTSPOtracers ([11C]PBR28 and [18F]DPA714). Firstly,estimates were compared in terms of both bias and correlation with standard kinetic methodology. Then, the method was tested on an independent sample of [11C]PBR28 scans before and after inflammatory interferon-αchallenge, and on test-retest dataset of [18F]DPA714 scans.

Results: Comparison with standard kinetic methodology showed good-to-excellent intra-subject correlation for regional(= 0.93 ± 0.08), although the bias was variable depending onIDIFability to approximate blood input functions (0.03-0.39 mL/cm3/min).unveiled a significant reduction ofBBBpermeability after inflammatory interferon-αchallenge, replicating results from standard quantification. High intra-subject correlation (ρ= 0.97 ± 0.01) was reported betweenestimates of test and retest scans.

Discussion: This evidence supports1T1K-IDIFas blood-free alternative to assessTSPOtracers' unidirectional blood brain clearance.investigation could complement more traditional measures inTSPOstudies, and even allow further mechanistic insight in the interpretation ofTSPOsignal.

TITLE: Comparison between a dual-time-window protocol and other simplified protocols for dynamic total-body 18F-FDG PET imaging

AUTHORS: Zhenguo Wang, Yaping Wu, Xiaochen Li, Yan Bai, Hongzhao Chen, Jie Ding, Chushu Shen, Zhanli Hu, Dong Liang, Xin Liu, Hairong Zheng, Yongfeng Yang, Yun Zhou, Meiyun Wang, Tao Sun

JOURNAL: EJNMMI physics

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Efforts have been made both to avoid invasive blood sampling and to shorten the scan duration for dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. A total-body scanner, such as the uEXPLORER PET/CT, can relieve these challenges through the following features: First, the whole-body coverage allows for noninvasive input function from the aortic arteries; second, with a dramatic increase in sensitivity, image quality can still be maintained at a high level even with a shorter scan duration than usual. We implemented a dual-time-window (DTW) protocol for a dynamic total-body18F-FDG PET scan to obtain multiple kinetic parameters. The DTW protocol was then compared to several other simplified quantification methods for total-body FDG imaging that were proposed for conventional setup.

Methods: The research included 28 patient scans performed on an uEXPLORER PET/CT. By discarding the corresponding data in the middle of the existing full 60-min dynamic scan, the DTW protocol was simulated. Nonlinear fitting was used to estimate the missing data in the interval. The full input function was obtained from 15 subjects using a hybrid approach with a population-based image-derived input function. Quantification was carried out in three areas: the cerebral cortex, muscle, and tumor lesion. Micro- and macro-kinetic parameters for different scan durations were estimated by assuming an irreversible two-tissue compartment model. The visual performance of parametric images and region of interest-based quantification in several parameters were evaluated. Furthermore, simplified quantification methods (DTW, Patlak, fractional uptake ratio [FUR], and standardized uptake value [SUV]) were compared for similarity to the reference net influx rate Ki.

Results: Kiand K1derived from the DTW protocol showed overall good consistency (P < 0.01) with the reference from the 60-min dynamic scan with 10-min early scan and 5-min late scan (Kicorrelation: 0.971, 0.990, and 0.990; K1correlation: 0.820, 0.940, and 0.975 in the cerebral cortex, muscle, and tumor lesion, respectively). Similar correlationss were found for other micro-parameters. The DTW protocol had the lowest bias relative to standard Kithan any of the quantification methods, followed by FUR and Patlak. SUV had the weakest correlation with Ki. The whole-body Kiand K1images generated by the DTW protocol were consistent with the reference parametric images.

Conclusions: Using the DTW protocol, the dynamic total-body FDG scan time can be reduced to 15 min while obtaining accurate Kiand K1quantification and acceptable visual performance in parametric images. However, the trade-off between quantification accuracy and protocol implementation feasibility must be considered in practice. We recommend that the DTW protocol be used when the clinical task requires reliable visual assessment or quantifying multiple micro-parameters; FUR with a hybrid input function may be a more feasible approach to quantifying regional metabolic rate with a known lesion position or organs of interest.

TITLE: PET Imaging of Synaptic Density: Challenges and Opportunities of Synaptic Vesicle Glycoprotein 2A PET in Small Animal Imaging

AUTHORS: Takuya Toyonaga, Arman Fesharaki-Zadeh, Stephen M Strittmatter, Richard E Carson, Zhengxin Cai

JOURNAL: Frontiers in neuroscience

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
The development of novel PET imaging agents for synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A) allowed for thein vivodetection of synaptic density changes, which are correlated with the progression and severity of a variety of neuropsychiatric diseases. While multiple ongoing clinical investigations using SV2A PET are expanding its applications rapidly, preclinical SV2A PET imaging in animal models is an integral component of the translation research and provides supporting and complementary information. Herein, we overview preclinical SV2A PET studies in animal models of neurodegenerative disorders and discuss the opportunities and practical challenges in small animal SV2A PET imaging. At the Yale PET Center, we have conducted SV2A PET imaging studies in animal models of multiple diseases and longitudinal SV2A PET allowed us to evaluate synaptic density dynamics in the brains of disease animal models and to assess pharmacological effects of novel interventions. In this article, we discuss key considerations when designing preclinical SV2A PET imaging studies and strategies for data analysis. Specifically, we compare the brain imaging characteristics of available SV2A tracers, i.e., [11C]UCB-J, [18F]SynVesT-1, [18F]SynVesT-2, and [18F]SDM-16, in rodent brains. We also discuss the limited spatial resolution of PET scanners for small brains and challenges of kinetic modeling. We then compare different injection routes and estimate the maximum throughput (i.e., number of animals) per radiotracer synthesis by taking into account the injectable volume for each injection method, injected mass, and radioactivity half-lives. In summary, this article provides a perspective for designing and analyzing SV2A PET imaging studies in small animals.

TITLE: Combined whole-body dynamic and static PET/CT with low-dose [18F]PSMA-1007 in prostate cancer patients

AUTHORS: Christos Sachpekidis, Leyun Pan, Martin Groezinger, Dimitrios Stefanos Strauss, Antonia Dimitrakopoulou-Strauss

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Aim: In addition to significant improvements in sensitivity and image quality, the recent introduction of long axial field-of-view (LAFOV) PET/CT scanners has enabled dynamic whole-body imaging for the first time. We aim herein to determine an appropriate acquisition time range for static low-dose [18F]PSMA-1007 PET imaging and to investigate the whole-body pharmacokinetics of [18F]PSMA-1007 by dynamic PET with the LAFOV Biograph Vision Quadra PET/CT in a group of prostate cancer patients.

Methodology: In total, 38 prostate cancer patients were enrolled in the analysis for staging or re-staging purposes. Thirty-four patients underwent dynamic whole-body PET/CT (60 min) followed by static whole-body PET/CT and four patients underwent static whole-body PET/CT only. The activity applied was 2 MBq/kg [18F]PSMA-1007. The static PET images of 10-min duration (PET-10) were reconstructed and further split into 8-min (PET-8), 6-min (PET-6), 5-min (PET-5), 4-min (PET-4), and 2-min (PET-2) duration groups. Comparisons were made between the different reconstructed scan times in terms of lesion detection rate and image quality based on SUV calculations of tumor lesions and the spleen, which served as background. Analysis of the dynamic PET/CT data was based on a two-tissue compartment model using an image-derived input function obtained from the descending aorta.

Results: Analysis of lesion detection rate showed no significant differences when reducing PET acquisitions from 10 up to 5 min. In particular, a total of 169 lesions were counted with PET-10, and the corresponding lesion detection rates (95% CI for the 90% quantile of the differences in tumor lesions) for shorter acquisitions were 100% (169/169) for PET-8 (95% CI: 0-0), 98.8% (167/169) for PET-6 (95% CI: 0-1), 95.9% (162/169) for PET-5 (95% CI: 0-3), 91.7% (155/169) for PET-4 (95% CI: 1-2), and 85.2% (144/169) for PET-2 (95% CI: 1-6). With the exception of PET-2, the differences observed between PET-10 and the other shorter acquisition protocols would have no impact on any patient in terms of clinical management. Objective evaluation of PET/CT image quality showed no significant decrease in tumor-to-background ratio (TBR) with shorter acquisition times, despite a gradual decrease in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the spleen. Whole-body quantitative [18F]PSMA-1007 pharmacokinetic analysis acquired with full dynamic PET scanning was feasible in all patients. Two-tissue compartment modeling revealed significantly higher values for the parameter k3in tumor lesions and parotid gland compared to liver and spleen, reflecting a higher specific tracer binding to the PSMA molecule and internalization rate in these tissues, a finding also supported by the respective time-activity curves. Furthermore, correlation analysis demonstrated a significantly strong positive correlation (r = 0.72) between SUV and k3in tumor lesions.

Conclusions: In prostate cancer, low-dose (2 MBq/kg) [18F]PSMA-1007 LAFOV PET/CT can reduce static scan time by 50% without significantly compromising lesion detection rate and objective image quality. In addition, dynamic PET can elucidate molecular pathways related to the physiology of [18F]PSMA-1007 in both tumor lesions and normal organs at the whole-body level. These findings unfold many of the potentials of the new LAFOV PET/CT technology in the field of PSMA-based diagnosis and theranostics of prostate cancer.

TITLE: Isoflurane and ketamine-xylazine modify pharmacokinetics of [18F]SynVesT-1 in the mouse brain

AUTHORS: Alan Miranda, Daniele Bertoglio, Caro De Weerdt, Steven Staelens, Jeroen Verhaeghe

JOURNAL: Journal of cerebral blood flow and metabolism : official journal of the International Society of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
We investigated the effect of isoflurane and ketamine-xylazine anesthesia on the positron emission tomography (PET) tracer [18F]SynVesT-1 in the mouse brain. [18F]SynVesT-1 PET scans were performed in C57BL/6J mice in five conditions: isoflurane anesthesia (ANISO), ketamine-xylazine (ANKX), awake freely moving (AW), awake followed by isoflurane administration (AW/ANISO) or followed by ketamine-xylazine (AW/ANKX) 20 min post tracer injection. ANISO, ANKX and AW scans were also performed in mice administered with levetiracetam (LEV, 200 mg/kg) to assess non-displaceable binding. Metabolite analysis was performed in ANISO, ANKX and AW mice. Finally,in vivoautoradiography in ANISO, ANKX and AW mice at 30 min post-injection was performed for validation. Kinetic modeling, with a metabolite corrected image derived input function, was performed to calculate total and non-displaceable volume of distribution (VT(IDIF)).VT(IDIF)was higher in ANISO compared to AW (p < 0.0001) whileVT(IDIF)in ANKX was lower compared with AW (p < 0.0001). Non-displaceableVT(IDIF)was significantly different between ANISO and AW, but not between ANKX and AW. Change in the TAC washout was observed after administration of either isoflurane or ketamine-xylazine. Observed changes in tracer kinetics and volume of distribution might be explained by physiological changes due to anesthesia, as well as by induced cellular effects.

ABSTRACT:
Gabapentin, a selective ligand for the α2δ subunit of voltage-dependent calcium channels, is an anticonvulsant medication used in the treatment of neuropathic pain, epilepsy, and other neurological conditions. We recently described two radiofluorinated derivatives of gabapentin (trans-4-[18F]fluorogabapentin, [18F]tGBP4F, andcis-4-[18F]fluorogabapentin, [18F]cGBP4F) and showed that these compounds accumulate in the injured nerves in a rodent model of neuropathic pain. Given the use of gabapentin in brain diseases, here we investigate whether these radiofluorinated derivatives of gabapentin can be used for imaging α2δ receptors in the brain. Specifically, we developed automated radiosynthesis methods for [18F]tGBP4F and [18F]cGBP4F and conducted dynamic PET imaging in adult rhesus macaques with and without preadministration of pharmacological doses of gabapentin. Both radiotracers showed very high metabolic stability, negligible plasma protein binding, and slow accumulation in the brain. [18F]tGBP4F, the isomer with higher binding affinity, showed low brain uptake and could not be displaced, whereas [18F]cGBP4F showed moderate brain uptake and could be partially displaced. Kinetic modeling of brain regional time-activity curves using a metabolite-corrected arterial input function shows that a one-tissue compartment model accurately fits the data. Graphical analysis using Logan or multilinear analysis 1 produced similar results as compartmental modeling, indicating robust quantification. This study advances our understanding of how gabapentinoids work and provides an important advancement toward imaging α2δ receptors in the brain.

TITLE: Deep-learning-derived input function in dynamic [18F]FDG PET imaging of mice

AUTHORS: Samuel Kuttner, Luigi T Luppino, Laurence Convert, Otman Sarrhini, Roger Lecomte, Michael C Kampffmeyer, Rune Sundset, Robert Jenssen

JOURNAL: Frontiers in nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Dynamic positron emission tomography and kinetic modeling play a critical role in tracer development research using small animals. Kinetic modeling from dynamic PET imaging requires accurate knowledge of an input function, ideally determined through arterial blood sampling. Arterial cannulation in mice, however, requires complex, time-consuming and terminal surgery, meaning that longitudinal studies are impossible. The aim of the current work was to develop and evaluate a non-invasive, deep-learning-based prediction model (DLIF) that directly takes the PET data as input to predict a usable input function. We first trained and evaluated the DLIF model on 68 [18F]Fluorodeoxyglucose mouse scans with image-derived targets using cross validation. Subsequently, we evaluated the performance of a trained DLIF model on an external dataset consisting of 8 mouse scans where the input function was measured by continuous arterial blood sampling. The results showed that the predicted DLIF and image-derived targets were similar, and the net influx rate constants following from Patlak modeling using DLIF as input function were strongly correlated to the corresponding values obtained using the image-derived input function. There were somewhat larger discrepancies when evaluating the model on the external dataset, which could be attributed to systematic differences in the experimental setup between the two datasets. In conclusion, our non-invasive DLIF prediction method may be a viable alternative to arterial blood sampling in small animal [18F]FDG imaging. With further validation, DLIF could overcome the need for arterial cannulation and allow fully quantitative and longitudinal experiments in PET imaging studies of mice.

TITLE: Kinetically Consistent Data Assimilation for Plant PET Sparse Time Activity Curve Signals

AUTHORS: Nicola D'Ascenzo, Qingguo Xie, Emanuele Antonecchia, Mariachiara Ciardiello, Giancarlo Pagnani, Michele Pisante

JOURNAL: Frontiers in plant science

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Time activity curve (TAC) signal processing in plant positron emission tomography (PET) is a frontier nuclear science technique to bring out the quantitative fluid dynamic (FD) flow parameters of the plant vascular system and generate knowledge on crops and their sustainable management, facing the accelerating global climate change. The sparse space-time sampling of the TAC signal impairs the extraction of the FD variables, which can be determined only as averaged values with existing techniques. A data-driven approach based on a reliable FD model has never been formulated. A novel sparse data assimilation digital signal processing method is proposed, with the unique capability of a direct computation of the dynamic evolution of noise correlations between estimated and measured variables, by taking into explicit account the numerical diffusion due to the sparse sampling. The sequential time-stepping procedure estimates the spatial profile of the velocity, the diffusion coefficient and the compartmental exchange rates along the plant stem from the TAC signals. To illustrate the performance of the method, we report an example of the measurement of transport mechanisms in zucchini sprouts.

TITLE: Short-duration dynamic FDG PET imaging: Optimization and clinical application

JOURNAL: Physica medica : PM : an international journal devoted to the applications of physics to medicine and biology : official journal of the Italian Association of Biomedical Physics (AIFB)

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: We aimed to investigate whether short dynamic PET imaging started at injection, complemented with routine clinical acquisition at 60-min post-injection (static), can achieve reliable kinetic analysis.

Methods: Dynamic and static 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) PET data were generated using realistic simulations to assess uncertainties due to statistical noise as well as bias. Following image reconstructions, kinetic parameters obtained from a 2-tissue-compartmental model (2TCM) were estimated, making use of the static image, and the time duration of dynamic PET data were incrementally shortened. We also investigated, in the first 2-min, different frame sampling rates, towards optimized dynamic PET imaging. Kinetic parameters from shortened dynamic datasets were additionally estimated for 9 patients (15 scans) with liver metastases of colorectal cancer, and were compared with those derived from full dynamic imaging using correlation and Passing-Bablok regression analyses.

Results: The results showed that by reduction of dynamic scan times from 60-min to as short as 5-min, while using static data at 60-min post-injection, bias and variability stayed comparable in estimated kinetic parameters. Early frame samplings of 5, 24 and 30 s yielded highest biases compared to other schemes. An early frame sampling of 10 s generally kept both bias and variability to a minimum. In clinical studies, strong correlation (r ≥ 0.97, P < 0.0001) existed between all kinetic parameters in full vs. shortened scan protocols.

Conclusions: Shortened 5-min dynamic scan, sampled as 12 × 10 + 6 × 30 s, followed by 3-min static image at 60-min post-injection, enables accurate and robust estimation of 2TCM parameters, while enabling generation of SUV estimates.

ABSTRACT:
Cerebral blood flow (CBF) can be measured with dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) of15O-labeled water by using tracer kinetic modelling. However, for quantification of regional CBF, an arterial input function (AIF), obtained from arterial blood sampling, is required. In this work we evaluated a novel, non-invasive approach for input function prediction based on machine learning (MLIF), against AIF for CBF PET measurements in human subjects.Twenty-five subjects underwent two 10 min dynamic15O-water brain PET scans with continuous arterial blood sampling, before (baseline) and following acetazolamide medication. Three different image-derived time-activity curves were automatically segmented from the carotid arteries and used as input into a Gaussian process-based AIF prediction model, considering both baseline and acetazolamide scans as training data. The MLIF approach was evaluated by comparing AIF and MLIF curves, as well as whole-brain grey matter CBF values estimated by kinetic modelling derived with either AIF or MLIF.The results showed that AIF and MLIF curves were similar and that corresponding CBF values were highly correlated and successfully differentiated before and after acetazolamide medication. In conclusion, our non-invasive MLIF method shows potential to replace the AIF obtained from blood sampling for CBF measurements using15O-water PET and kinetic modelling.

JOURNAL: British journal of cancer

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Background: 18F-fluciclovine is a synthetic amino acid positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer that is approved for use in prostate cancer. In this clinical study, we characterised the kinetic model best describing the uptake of18F-fluciclovine in breast cancer and assessed differences in tracer kinetics and static parameters for different breast cancer receptor subtypes and tumour grades.

Methods: Thirty-nine patients with pathologically proven breast cancer underwent 20-min dynamic PET/computed tomography imaging following the administration of18F-fluciclovine. Uptake into primary breast tumours was evaluated using one- and two-tissue reversible compartmental kinetic models and static parameters.

Results: A reversible one-tissue compartment model was shown to best describe tracer uptake in breast cancer. No significant differences were seen in kinetic or static parameters for different tumour receptor subtypes or grades. Kinetic and static parameters showed a good correlation.

Conclusions: 18F-fluciclovine has potential in the imaging of primary breast cancer, but kinetic analysis may not have additional value over static measures of tracer uptake.

TITLE: Simultaneous Denoising of Dynamic PET Images Based on Deep Image Prior

AUTHORS: Cheng-Hsun Yang, Hsuan-Ming Huang

JOURNAL: Journal of digital imaging

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Parametric imaging obtained from kinetic modeling analysis of dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) data is a useful tool for quantifying tracer kinetics. However, pixel-wise time-activity curves have high noise levels which lead to poor quality of parametric images. To solve this limitation, we proposed a new image denoising method based on deep image prior (DIP). Like the original DIP method, the proposed DIP method is an unsupervised method, in which no training dataset is required. However, the difference is that our method can simultaneously denoise all dynamic PET images. Moreover, we propose a modified version of the DIP method called double DIP (DDIP), which has two DIP architectures. The additional DIP model is used to generate high-quality input data for the second DIP model. Computer simulations were performed to evaluate the performance of the proposed DIP-based methods. Our simulation results showed that the DDIP method outperformed the single DIP method. In addition, the DDIP method combined with data augmentation could generate PET parametric images with superior image quality compared to the spatiotemporal-based non-local means filtering and high constrained backprojection. Our preliminary results show that our proposed DDIP method is a novel and effective unsupervised method for simultaneously denoising dynamic PET images.

TITLE: Correlation of the quantitative methods for the measurement of bone uptake and plasma clearance of 18F-NaF using positron emission tomography. Systematic review and meta-analysis

AUTHORS: Rajeh Assiri, Karen Knapp, Jon Fulford, Junning Chen

JOURNAL: European journal of radiology

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: 18F-NaF PET is valuable for detecting bone metabolism through osteoblastic activity in the assessment of bone disease. Hawkins, Patlak, and standardised uptake value (SUV) are the most common quantitative measurements used to evaluate bone metabolism. This systematic review evaluates the correlation between quantitative positron emission tomography (PET) methods and to compare their precision.

Methods: A systematic search in Medline, PubMed, SCOPUS, and Web of Science was undertaken to find relevant papers published from 2000. All studies with human adults undergoing18F-NaF PET, PET/CT, or PET/MRI were included except for subjects diagnosed with non-diffuse metabolic bone disease or malignancy. Quality Assessment Tool for Studies of Diverse Designs (QATSDD) was used to assess risk of bias. A qualitative review and meta-analysis using Hedges random-effect model was used producing summary size effects of the correlation between methods in healthy and unhealthy bone sites and assessing study heterogeneity.

Results: 228 healthy and unhealthy participants were included across 12 studies resulted from the systematic search. One-third of studies had a moderate quality percentage while the rest had relatively high quality. The pooled correlation coefficient in meta-analysis showed a high correlation of more than 0.88 (0.71-1.05. 95 %CI) between SUV and Hawkins and more than 0.96 (0.88-1.03. 95 %CI) between Patlak and Hawkins within all subgroups, suggesting all methods yield similar results in healthy and unhealthy bone sites. SUV has the lowest precision error followed by Patlak while Hawkins method showed the highest precision error.

Conclusion: Patlak is the best within research and SUV is better within clinical practice.

AUTHORS: Philipp Mohr, Joyce van Sluis, Adrienne H Brouwers, Marjolijn N Lub-de Hooge, Zekai Li, Claudia A J van Winkel, Adriaan A Lammertsma, Charalampos Tsoumpas

JOURNAL: Nuclear medicine and biology

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Clinical89Zr-immunoPET relies on semi-quantitative metrics, such as standardised uptake values (SUV) from static imaging at delayed time points. However, SUV can misinterpret target engagement as it ignores plasma and tissue kinetics. Kinetic modelling, common for shorter-lived tracers, is rarely applied to89Zr-labelled monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) due to slow kinetics. This study characterises89Zr-immunoPET kinetics using a two-tissue compartment model, identifies factors affecting tracer uptake, and assesses the validity of semi-quantitative metrics.

Procedures: Realistic plasma input functions with different clearance rates, representing variable mAb kinetics and cold mAb doses, were derived from previous studies. Realistic ranges for kinetic rate constants and blood volume fractions were estimated based on literature. Each parameter was varied to assess its effect on89Zr-immunoPET time-activity curves and Patlak analysis. SUV and target-to-plasma ratios (TPR) at delayed time points were compared with Patlak net irreversible rate of uptake (Ki).

Results: Fast plasma kinetics resulted in small but specific uptake, while slow kinetics produced higher signals with larger nonspecific contributions. SUV and Kiwere driven by tracer delivery (K1) and residualisation upon binding (k3), depending on the scenario. Within groups with limited variations in plasma clearance, semi-quantitative metrics correlated well with Ki. For slow kinetics, where nonspecific uptake contributes more prominently, TPR performed better than SUV. However, despite good agreement in general, linear fits between semi-quantitative metrics and Kishowed notable variability, indicating their limited reliability as surrogates for Ki. Between groups with large differences in plasma clearance, only normalisation by the integral of the plasma input function, as in Patlak analysis, enabled accurate interpretation.

Conclusions: Patlak analysis accounts for plasma kinetics and reversible signals, enabling more accurate interpretation of89Zr-immunoPET data than SUV. Wider use of kinetic modelling could enhance quantitative accuracy, support reinterpretation of past studies, and guide future study design.

TITLE: Reliability of rubidium-82 PET/CT for renal perfusion determination in healthy subjects

AUTHORS: Stine Sundgaard Langaa, Frank Holden Mose, Claire Anne Fynbo, Jørn Theil, Jesper Nørgaard Bech

JOURNAL: BMC nephrology

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Background: Changes in renal perfusion may play a pathophysiological role in hypertension and kidney disease, however to date, no method for renal blood flow (RBF) determination in humans has been implemented in clinical practice. In a previous study, we demonstrated that estimation of renal perfusion based on a single positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scan with Rubidium-82 (82Rb) is feasible and found an approximate 5% intra-assay coefficient of variation for both kidneys, indicative of a precise method.This study's aim was to determine the day-to day variation of82Rb PET/CT and to test the method's ability to detect increased RBF induced by infusion of amino acids.

Methods: Seventeen healthy subjects underwent three dynamic82Rb PET/CT scans over two examination days comprising: Day A, a single 8-minute dynamic scan and Day B, two scans performed before (baseline) and after RBF stimulation by a 2-hour amino acid-infusion. The order of examination days was determined by randomization. Time activity curves for arterial and renal activity with a 1-tissue compartment model were used for flow estimation; the K1kinetic parameter representing renal82Rb clearance. Day-to-day variation was calculated based on the difference between the unstimulated K1values on Day A and Day B and paired t-testing was performed to compare K1values at baseline and after RBF stimulation on Day B.

Results: Day-to-day variation was observed to be 5.5% for the right kidney and 6.0% for the left kidney (n = 15 quality accepted scans). K1values determined after amino acid-infusion were significantly higher than pre-infusion values (n = 17, p = 0.001). The mean percentage change in K1from baseline was 13.2 ± 12.9% (range - 10.4 to 35.5) for the right kidney; 12.9 ± 13.2% (range - 15.7 to 35.3) for the left kidney.

Conclusion: Day-to-day variation is acceptably low. A significant K1increase from baseline is detected after application of a known RBF stimulus, indicating that82Rb PET/CT scanning can provide a precise method for evaluation of RBF and it is able to determine changes herein.

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: [68Ga]Ga-FAPI PET/CT has been widely used in clinical diagnosis and radiopharmaceutical therapy. In this study, tumor-to-blood ratio (TBR) was evaluated as a powerful tool for semiquantitative assessment of [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 tumor uptake and as an effective index for tumors with high FAP expression in theranostics.

Methods: Nine patients with pancreatic cancer underwent a 60-min dynamic PET/CT scan by total-body PET/CT (with a long AFOV of 194 cm) after injection of [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04. After dynamic PET/CT scan, three patients received chemotherapy and underwent the second dynamic scan to evaluate treatment response. Time-activity curves (TACs) were obtained by drawing regions of interest for primary pancreatic lesions and metastatic lesions. The lesion TACs were fitted using four compartment models by the software PMOD PKIN kinetic modeling. The preferred pharmacokinetic model for [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 was evaluated based on the Akaike information criterion. The correlations between simplified methods for quantification of [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 (SUVs; tumor-to-blood ratios [TBRs]) and the total distribution volume (Vt) estimates obtained from pharmacokinetic analysis were calculated.

Results: In total, 9 primary lesions and 25 metastatic lesions were evaluated. The reversible two-tissue compartment model (2TCM) was the most appropriate model among the four compartment models. The total distribution volume Vtvalues derived from 2TCM varied significantly in pathological lesions and background regions. A strong positive correlation was observed between TBRmeanand Vtfrom the 2TCM model in pathological lesions (R2=0.92, P<0.001). The relative difference range for TBRmeanwas 2.1% compared to the reduction rate of Vtin the patients who were treated with chemotherapy.

Conclusions: A strong positive correlation was observed between TBRmeanand Vtfor [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04. TBRmeanreflects FAP receptor density better than SUVmeanand SUVmax, and would be the preferred measurement tool for semiquantitative assessment of [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 tumor uptake and as a means for evaluating treatment response.

ABSTRACT:
Current PET datasets are becoming larger, thereby increasing the demand for fast and reproducible processing pipelines. This paper presents a freely available, open source, Python-based software package called NiftyPAD, for versatile analyses of static, full or dual-time window dynamic brain PET data. The key novelties of NiftyPAD are the analyses of dual-time window scans with reference input processing, pharmacokinetic modelling with shortened PET acquisitions through the incorporation of arterial spin labelling (ASL)-derived relative perfusion measures, as well as optional PET data-based motion correction. Results obtained with NiftyPAD were compared with the well-established software packages PPET and QModeling for a range of kinetic models. Clinical data from eight subjects scanned with four different amyloid tracers were used to validate the computational performance. NiftyPAD achieved [Formula: see text] correlation with PPET, with absolute difference [Formula: see text] for linearised Logan and MRTM2 methods, and [Formula: see text] correlation with QModeling, with absolute difference [Formula: see text] for basis function based SRTM and SRTM2 models. For the recently published SRTM ASL method, which is unavailable in existing software packages, high correlations with negligible bias were observed with the full scan SRTM in terms of non-displaceable binding potential ([Formula: see text]), indicating reliable model implementation in NiftyPAD. Together, these findings illustrate that NiftyPAD is versatile, flexible, and produces comparable results with established software packages for quantification of dynamic PET data. It is freely available ( https://github.com/AMYPAD/NiftyPAD ), and allows for multi-platform usage. The modular setup makes adding new functionalities easy, and the package is lightweight with minimal dependencies, making it easy to use and integrate into existing processing pipelines.

TITLE: Direct Reconstruction of Linear Parametric Images From Dynamic PET Using Nonlocal Deep Image Prior

AUTHORS: Kuang Gong, Ciprian Catana, Jinyi Qi, Quanzheng Li

JOURNAL: IEEE transactions on medical imaging

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Direct reconstruction methods have been developed to estimate parametric images directly from the measured PET sinograms by combining the PET imaging model and tracer kinetics in an integrated framework. Due to limited counts received, signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) and resolution of parametric images produced by direct reconstruction frameworks are still limited. Recently supervised deep learning methods have been successfully applied to medical imaging denoising/reconstruction when large number of high-quality training labels are available. For static PET imaging, high-quality training labels can be acquired by extending the scanning time. However, this is not feasible for dynamic PET imaging, where the scanning time is already long enough. In this work, we proposed an unsupervised deep learning framework for direct parametric reconstruction from dynamic PET, which was tested on the Patlak model and the relative equilibrium Logan model. The training objective function was based on the PET statistical model. The patient's anatomical prior image, which is readily available from PET/CT or PET/MR scans, was supplied as the network input to provide a manifold constraint, and also utilized to construct a kernel layer to perform non-local feature denoising. The linear kinetic model was embedded in the network structure as a 1 ×1 ×1 convolution layer. Evaluations based on dynamic datasets of18F-FDG and11C-PiB tracers show that the proposed framework can outperform the traditional and the kernel method-based direct reconstruction methods.

ABSTRACT:
Transmembrane AMPA receptor regulatory protein γ-8 (TARP γ-8) mediates various AMPA receptor functions. Recently, [11C]TARP-2105 was developed as a PET ligand for TARP γ-8 imaging. We performed a full kinetic analysis of [11C]TARP-2105 using PET with [11C]TARP-2105 for the first time. The distribution volume (VT), which is a macro parameter consisting of theK1-k4rate constants in the two-tissue compartment model analysis, exhibited the following rank order: hippocampus (1.4 ± 0.3) > amygdala (1.0 ± 0.2) > frontal cortex (0.9 ± 0.2) > striatum (0.8 ± 0.2) ≫ cerebellum (0.5 ± 0.1) ≈ thalamus (0.5 ± 0.1) > pons (0.4 ± 0.1 mL/cm3). These heterogenousVTvalues corresponded with the order of biological distribution of TARP γ-8 in the brain. To validate the reference tissue model, the binding potential (BPND) of [11C]TARP-2105 for TARP γ-8 was estimated using general methods (SRTM, MRTM0, Logan reference model, and ratio method). These BPNDs based on reference models indicated excellent correlation (R2> 0.9) to the indirect BPNDs based on 2TCM with moderate reproducibility (%variability ≈ 10). PET with [11C]TARP-2105 enabled noninvasive BPNDestimation and visual mapping of TARP γ-8 in the living rat brain.

AUTHORS: Gonçalo S Clemente, Inês F Antunes, Jürgen W A Sijbesma, Aren van Waarde, Adriaan A Lammertsma, Alexander Dömling, Philip H Elsinga

JOURNAL: Molecular pharmaceutics

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Statins are 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors that are widely used to prevent cardiovascular diseases. However, a series of pleiotropic mechanisms have been associated with statins, particularly with atorvastatin. Therefore, the assessment of [18F]atorvastatin kinetics with positron emission tomography (PET) may elucidate the mechanism of action of statins and the impact of sexual dimorphism, which is one of the most debated interindividual variations influencing the therapeutic efficacy. [18F]Atorvastatin was synthesized via a previously optimized18F-deoxyfluorination strategy, used for preclinical PET studies in female and male Wistar rats (n= 7 for both groups), and for subsequentex vivobiodistribution assessment. PET data were fitted to several pharmacokinetic models, which allowed for estimating relevant kinetic parameters. Both PET imaging and biodistribution studies showed negligible uptake of [18F]atorvastatin in all tissues compared with the primary target organ (liver), excretory pathways (kidneys and small intestine), and stomach. Uptake of [18F]atorvastatin was 38 ± 3% higher in the female liver than in the male liver. The irreversible 2-tissue compartment model showed the best fit to describe [18F]atorvastatin kinetics in the liver. A strong correlation (R2> 0.93) between quantitativeKi(the radiotracer's unidirectional net rate of influx between compartments) and semi-quantitative liver's SUV (standard uptake value), measured between 40 to 90 min, showed potential to use the latter parameter, which circumvents the need for blood sampling as a surrogate ofKifor monitoring [18F]atorvastatin uptake. Preclinical assays showed faster uptake and clearance for female rats compared to males, seemingly related to a higher efficiency for exchanges between the arterial input and the hepatic tissue. Due to the slow [18F]atorvastatin kinetics, equilibrium between the liver and plasma concentration was not reached during the time frame studied, making it difficult to obtain sufficient and accurate kinetic information to quantitatively characterize the radiotracer pharmacokinetics over time. Nevertheless, the reported results suggest that the SUV can potentially be used as a simplified measure, provided all scans are performed at the same time point. Preclinical PET-studies with [18F]atorvastatin showed faster uptake and clearance in female compared to male rats, apparently related to higher efficiency for exchange between arterial blood and hepatic tissue.

TITLE: First experiences with dynamic renal [68Ga]Ga-DOTA PET/CT: a comparison to renal scintigraphy and compartmental modelling to non-invasively estimate the glomerular filtration rate

AUTHORS: David Kersting, Miriam Sraieb, Robert Seifert, Pedro Fragoso Costa, Sandra Kazek, Lukas Kessler, Lale Umutlu, Wolfgang Peter Fendler, Walter Jentzen, Ken Herrmann, Florian Büther, Michael Nader, Christoph Rischpler

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: The determination of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is decisive for a variety of clinical issues, for example, to monitor the renal function in radionuclide therapy patients. Renal scintigraphy using glomerularly filtered tracers allows combined acquisition of renograms and GFR estimation but requires repeated blood sampling for several hours. In contrast, dynamic PET imaging using the glomerularly filtered tracer [68Ga]Ga-DOTA bears the potential to non-invasively estimate the GFR by compartmental kinetic modelling. Here, we report the, to our knowledge, first comparison of human renal dynamic [68Ga]Ga-DOTA PET imaging in comparison to renal scintigraphy and compare PET-derived to serum creatinine-derived GFR measurements.

Methods: Dynamic [68Ga]Ga-DOTA PET data were acquired for 30 min immediately after tracer injection in 12 patients. PET and renal scintigraphy images were visually interpreted in a consensus read by three nuclear medicine physicians. The functional renal cortex was segmented to obtain time-activity curves. The arterial input function was estimated from the PET signal in the abdominal aorta. Single-compartmental tracer kinetic modelling was performed to calculate the GFR using complete 30-min (GFRPET-30) and reduced 15-min PET data sets (GFRPET-15) to evaluate whether a shorter acquisition time is sufficient for an accurate GFR estimation. A modified approach excluding minutes 2 to 10 was applied to reduce urinary spill-over effects. Serum creatinine-derived GFRCKD(CKD-EPI-formula) was used as reference standard.

Results: PET image interpretation revealed the same findings as conventional scintigraphy (2/12 patients with both- and 1/12 patients with right-sided urinary obstruction). Model fit functions were substantially improved for the modified approach to exclude spill-over. Depending on the modelling approach, GFRCKDand both GFRPET-30and GFRPET-15were well correlated with interclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) from 0.74 to 0.80 and Pearson's correlation coefficients (PCCs) from 0.74 to 0.81. For a subgroup of patients with undisturbed urinary efflux (n = 9), correlations were good to excellent (ICCs from 0.82 to 0.95 and PCCs from 0.83 to 0.95). Overall, GFRPET-30and GFRPET-15were excellently correlated (ICCs from 0.96 to 0.99 and PCCs from 0.96 to 0.99).

Conclusion: Renal [68Ga]Ga-DOTA PET can be a suitable alternative to conventional scintigraphy. Visual assessment of PET images and conventional renograms revealed comparable results. GFR values derived by non-invasive single-compartmental-modelling of PET data show a good correlation to serum creatinine-derived GFR values. In patients with undisturbed urinary efflux, the correlation was excellent. Dynamic PET data acquisition for 15 min is sufficient for visual evaluation and GFR derivation.

Multisystemic inflammation might be a key pathophysiologic mechanism in post-coronavirus disease 2019 (post-COVID) syndrome.N,N-diethyl-2-(2-(4-(2-fluoroethoxy)phenyl)5,7dimethylpyrazolo[1,5a] pyrimidin-3-yl)acetamide ([18F]DPA-714), which binds with high affinity the translocator protein (TSPO) receptor, is used as a marker of inflammation. Therefore, quantifying [18F]DPA-714 uptake throughout the body could assess extracerebral inflammation in post-COVID syndrome. However, the pharmacokinetics of whole-body [18F]DPA-714 uptake have not yet been assessed. Thus, before quantifying whole-body [18F]DPA-714 uptake in post-COVID syndrome, the aim of this study was to identify the optimal pharmacokinetic model in different extracerebral organs.Methods:Thirty-nine post-COVID participants with high-affinity binding for TSPO with or without persistent complaints were enrolled from the prospective VeCosCO study. Whole-body dynamic [18F]DPA-714 PET/CT scans (0-60 min after injection) were performed. Ascending aorta-based image-derived input functions were corrected with manual arterial blood samples to establish metabolite-corrected plasma input functions. Time-activity curves were derived from volumes of interest in the adrenal gland, bone, kidney, liver, lung, myocardium, pancreas, skeletal muscle, spleen, and thyroid. [18F]DPA-714 kinetics were studied by nonlinear regression fitting of 1- and 2-tissue-compartment models with an additional blood volume parameter to the time-activity curves.Results:An irreversible single-tissue-compartment model was preferred in bone and skeletal muscle, a reversible 2-tissue-compartment model was preferred in kidney and lung, and a reversible single-tissue-compartment model was preferred in the other organs. Our results showed various levels of [18F]DPA-714 uptake in the 10 extracerebral organs. The highest mean volume of distribution was found in myocardium (33.27 ± 11.91 mL⋅cm-3), and the lowest mean volume of distribution was found in lung (5.12 ± 2.85 mL⋅cm-3). The mean influx rate was higher in bone than in skeletal muscle (respectively, 0.101 vs. 0.052 mL⋅cm-3⋅min-1;P< 0.001).Conclusion:The TSPO receptor is widely distributed over the entire body, with very high [18F]DPA-714 uptake in several organs. An irreversible model in bone and skeletal muscle and a reversible model in the other organs were preferred to describe [18F]DPA-714 kinetics. Further studies using [18F]DPA-714 to assess extracerebral inflammation should consider these kinetic differences among TSPO-rich organs.

TITLE: The Importance of Time-of-Flight Reconstruction and Point Spread Modeling in the Measurement of Myocardial Blood Flow Parameters

AUTHORS: James A Case

JOURNAL: Current cardiology reports

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Purpose of review: Absolute quantitation of myocardial blood flow has been recognized as one of the most important advances in nuclear cardiology. The addition of absolute myocardial blood flow quantitation has had a significant impact on the determination of normalcy, artifact/defect differentiation, and the true extent of coronary artery disease in patients with known or suspected coronary disease. Time-of-flight reconstruction and point spread function modeling of the potential to greatly improve resolution and signal to background. This combined with absolute blood flow measurements could improve the reliability of regional blood flow estimates and overall image quality.

Recent findings: Recent publications have demonstrated that time-of-flight reconstruction can have an impact on the amount of spillover between the blood pool ROI and the myocardial regions. This may necessitate changes to kinetic models; however, these changes if implemented correctly may result in improved accuracy and reproducibility of blood flow estimates. This may also have the benefit of assessing blood flow in the microvasculature using newer F-18 labeled blood flow tracers. Time of flight and point spread function modeling represent significant improvements in the accuracy and quality of reconstructed myocardial perfusion PET images. This may also have significant implications for the reliability of blood flow estimates. To achieve these benefits, attention must be given to blood flow models to ensure that they have been correctly optimized for the scanner-specific time-of-flight reconstruction properties.

TITLE: Machine Learning-Based Noninvasive Quantification of Single-Imaging Session Dual-Tracer 18F-FDG and 68Ga-DOTATATE Dynamic PET-CT in Oncology

AUTHORS: Wenxiang Ding, Jiangyuan Yu, Chaojie Zheng, Peng Fu, Qiu Huang, David Dagan Feng, Zhi Yang, Richard L Wahl, Yun Zhou

JOURNAL: IEEE transactions on medical imaging

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
68Ga-DOTATATE PET-CT is routinely used for imaging neuroendocrine tumor (NET) somatostatin receptor subtype 2 (SSTR2) density in patients, and is complementary to FDG PET-CT for improving the accuracy of NET detection, characterization, grading, staging, and predicting/monitoring NET responses to treatment. Performing sequential18F-FDG and68Ga-DOTATATE PET scans would require 2 or more days and can delay patient care. To align temporal and spatial measurements of18F-FDG and68Ga-DOTATATE PET, and to reduce scan time and CT radiation exposure to patients, we propose a single-imaging session dual-tracer dynamic PET acquisition protocol in the study. A recurrent extreme gradient boosting (rXGBoost) machine learning algorithm was proposed to separate the mixed18F-FDG and68Ga-DOTATATE time activity curves (TACs) for the region of interest (ROI) based quantification with tracer kinetic modeling. A conventional parallel multi-tracer compartment modeling method was also implemented for reference. Single-scan dual-tracer dynamic PET was simulated from 12 NET patient studies with18F-FDG and68Ga-DOTATATE 45-min dynamic PET scans separately obtained within 2 days. Our experimental results suggested an18F-FDG injection first followed by68Ga-DOTATATE with a minimum 5 min delayed injection protocol for the separation of mixed18F-FDG and68Ga-DOTATATE TACs using rXGBoost algorithm followed by tracer kinetic modeling is highly feasible.

TITLE: Modelling [18F]LW223 PET data using simplified imaging protocols for quantification of TSPO expression in the rat heart and brain

AUTHORS: Mark G MacAskill, Catriona Wimberley, Timaeus E F Morgan, Carlos J Alcaide-Corral, David E Newby, Christophe Lucatelli, Andrew Sutherland, Sally L Pimlott, Adriana A S Tavares

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: To provide a comprehensive assessment of the novel 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO) radiotracer, [18F]LW223, kinetics in the heart and brain when using a simplified imaging approach.

Methods: Naive adult rats and rats with surgically induced permanent coronary artery ligation received a bolus intravenous injection of [18F]LW223 followed by 120 min PET scanning with arterial blood sampling throughout. Kinetic modelling of PET data was applied to estimated rate constants, total volume of distribution (VT) and binding potential transfer corrected (BPTC) using arterial or image-derived input function (IDIF). Quantitative bias of simplified protocols using IDIF versus arterial input function (AIF) and stability of kinetic parameters for PET imaging data of different length (40-120 min) were estimated.

Results: PET outcome measures estimated using IDIF significantly correlated with those derived with invasive AIF, albeit with an inherent systematic bias. Truncation of the dynamic PET scan duration to less than 100 min reduced the stability of the kinetic modelling outputs. Quantification of [18F]LW223 uptake kinetics in the brain and heart required the use of different outcome measures, with BPTCmore stable in the heart and VTmore stable in the brain.

Conclusion: Modelling of [18F]LW223 PET showed the use of simplified IDIF is acceptable in the rat and the minimum scan duration for quantification of TSPO expression in rats using kinetic modelling with this radiotracer is 100 min. Carefully assessing kinetic outcome measures when conducting a systems level as oppose to single-organ centric analyses is crucial. This should be taken into account when assessing the emerging role of the TSPO heart-brain axis in the field of PET imaging.

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the axial spine; however, the quantitative detection of inflammation in AS remains a challenge in clinical settings. We aimed to investigate the feasibility of using a specific P2X7R-targeting18F-labeled tracer [18F]GSK1482160 for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and the quantification of AS.

Methods: The radioligand [18F]GSK1482160 was obtained based on nucleophilic aliphatic substitution. Dynamic [18F]GSK1482160 and [18F]FDG micro-PET/CT imaging were performed on AS mice (n = 8) and age-matched controls (n = 8). Tracer kinetics modeling was performed using Logan's graphical arterial input function analysis to quantify the in vivo expression of P2X7R. The post-PET tissues were collected for hematoxylin-eosin (H&E), immunohistochemical (IHC), and immunofluorescence (IF) staining.

Results: [18F]GSK1482160 PET/CT imaging revealed that the specific binding in the ankle joint and sacroiliac joint (SIJ) of the AS at 8 weeks group (BPNDankle-AS-8W(non-displaceable binding potential of the ankle) 3.931 ± 0.74; BPNDSIJ-AS-8W(BPBDof the SIJ) 4.225 ± 0.84) were significantly higher than the controls at 8 weeks group (BPNDankle-Ctr-8W0.325 ± 0.15, BPNDSJJ-Ctr-8W0.319 ± 0.17) respectively, and the AS at 14 weeks group (BPNDankle-AS-14W12.212 ± 2.25; BPNDSJJ-AS-14W13.389 ± 3.60) were significantly higher than the controls at 14 weeks group (BPNDankle-Ctr-14W0.204 ± 0.16, BPNDSJJ-Ctr-14W0.655 ± 0.35) respectively. The four groups had no significant difference in the [18F]FDG uptake of ankle and SIJ. IHC and IF staining revealed that the overexpression of P2X7R was colocalized with activated macrophages from the ankle synovium and spinal endplate in mice with AS, indicating that quantification of P2X7R may contribute to the understanding of the pathogenesis of inflammation in human AS.

Conclusion: This study developed a novel P2X7R-targeting PET tracer [18F]GSK1482160 to detect the expression of P2X7R in AS mouse models and provided powerful non-invasive PET imaging and quantification for AS.

TITLE: Evaluation of [18F]PF-06455943 as a Potential LRRK2 PET Imaging Agent in the Brain of Nonhuman Primates

AUTHORS: Chi-Hyeon Yoo, Zhen Chen, Nisha Rani, Jiahui Chen, Jian Rong, Laigao Chen, Lei Zhang, Steven H Liang, Hsiao-Ying Wey

JOURNAL: ACS chemical neuroscience

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Mutations in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene are the common causes of inherited Parkinson's disease (PD) and emerged as a causative PD gene. Particularly, LRRK2-Gly2019Ser mutation was reported to alter the early phase of neuronal differentiation, increasing cell death. Selective inhibitors of LRRK2 kinase activity were considered as a promising therapeutic target for PD treatment. However, the development of effective brain-penetrant LRRK2 inhibitors remains challenging. Recently, we have developed a novel positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand for LRRK2 imaging and demonstrated preferable tracer properties in rodents. Herein, we evaluate [18F]PF-06455943 quantification methods in the nonhuman primate (NHP) brain using full kinetic modeling with radiometabolite-corrected arterial blood samples, and homologous blocking with two doses (0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg). Kinetic analysis results demonstrated that a two-tissue compartmental model and a Logan graphical analysis are appropriate for [18F]PF-06455943 PET quantification. In addition, we observed that total distribution volume (VT) values can be reliably estimated with as short as a 30 min scan duration. Homologous blocking studies confirmed the specific binding of [18F]PF-06455943 and revealed that the nonradioactive mass of PF-06455943 achieved 45-55% ofVTdisplacement in the whole brain. This work supports the translation of [18F]PF-06455943 PET imaging for the human brain and target occupancy studies.

JOURNAL: Drug and alcohol dependence

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Background: Dopaminergic mechanisms that may underlie cannabis' reinforcing effects are not well elucidated in humans. This positron emission tomography (PET) imaging study used the dopamine D2/3receptor antagonist [11C]raclopride and kinetic modelling testing for transient changes in radiotracer uptake to assess the striatal dopamine response to smoked cannabis in a preliminary sample.

Methods: PET emission data were acquired from regular cannabis users (n = 14; 7 M/7 F; 19-32 years old) over 90 min immediately after [11C]raclopride administration (584 ± 95 MBq) as bolus followed by constant infusion (Kbol= 105 min). Participants smoked a cannabis cigarette, using a paced puff protocol, 35 min after scan start. Plasma concentrations of Δ9-THC and metabolites and ratings of subjective "high" were collected during imaging. Striatal dopamine responses were assessed voxelwise with a kinetic model testing for transient reductions in [11C]raclopride binding, linear-parametric neurotransmitter PET (lp-ntPET) (cerebellum as a reference region).

Results: Cannabis smoking increased plasma Δ9-THC levels (peak: 0-10 min) and subjective high (peak: 0-30 min). Significant clusters (>16 voxels) modeled by transient reductions in [11C]raclopride binding were identified for all 12 analyzed scans. In total, 26 clusters of significant responses to cannabis were detected, of which 16 were located in the ventral striatum, including at least one ventral striatum cluster in 11 of the 12 analyzed scans.

Conclusions: These preliminary data support the sensitivity of [11C]raclopride PET with analysis of transient changes in radiotracer uptake to detect cannabis smoking-induced dopamine responses. This approach shows future promise to further elucidate roles of mesolimbic dopaminergic signaling in chronic cannabis use. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:NCT02817698.

TITLE: Impact of deep learning denoising on kinetic modelling for low-dose dynamic PET: application to single- and dual-tracer imaging protocols

AUTHORS: Florence M Muller, Elizabeth J Li, Margaret E Daube-Witherspoon, Austin R Pantel, Corinde E Wiers, Jacob G Dubroff, Christian Vanhove, Stefaan Vandenberghe, Joel S Karp

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Long-axial field-of-view PET scanners capture multi-organ tracer distribution with high sensitivity, enabling lower dose dynamic protocols and dual-tracer imaging for comprehensive disease characterization. However, reducing dose may compromise data quality and time-activity curve (TAC) fitting, leading to higher bias in kinetic parameters. Parametric imaging poses further challenges due to noise amplification in voxel-based modelling. We explore the potential of deep learning denoising (DL-DN) to improve quantification for low-dose dynamic PET.

Methods: Using 16 [18F]FDG PET studies from the PennPET Explorer, we trained a DL framework on 10-min images from late-phase uptake (static data) that were sub-sampled from 1/2 to 1/300 of the counts. This model was used to denoise early-to-late dynamic frame images. Its impact on quantification was evaluated using compartmental modelling and voxel-based graphical analysis for parametric imaging for single- and dual-tracer dynamic studies with [18F]FDG and [18F]FGln at original (injected) and reduced (sub-sampled) doses. Quantification differences were evaluated for the area under the curve of TACs, Kifor [18F]FDG and VTfor [18F]FGln, and parametric images.

Results: DL-DN consistently improved image quality across all dynamic frames, systematically enhancing TAC consistency and reducing tissue-dependent bias and variability in Kiand VTdown to 40 MBq doses. DL-DN preserved tumor heterogeneity in Logan VTimages and delineation of high-flux regions in Patlak Kimaps. In a /[18F]FDG dual-tracer study, bias trends aligned with single-tracer results but showed reduced accuracy for [¹⁸F]FGln in breast lesions at very low doses (4 MBq).

Conclusion: This study demonstrates that applying DL-DN trained on static [18F]FDG PET images to dynamic [18F]FDG and [18F]FGln PET can permit significantly reduced doses, preserving accurate FDG Kiand FGln VTmeasurements, and enhancing parametric image quality. DL-DN shows promise for improving dynamic PET quantification at reduced doses, including novel dual-tracer studies.

ABSTRACT:
As a non-invasive imaging tool, positron emission tomography (PET) plays an important role in brain science and disease research. Dynamic acquisition is one way of brain PET imaging. Its wide application in clinical research has often been hindered by practical challenges, such as patient involuntary movement, which could degrade both image quality and the accuracy of the quantification. This is even more obvious in scans of patients with neurodegeneration or mental disorders. Conventional motion compensation methods were either based on images or raw measured data, were shown to be able to reduce the effect of motion on the image quality. As for a dynamic PET scan, motion compensation can be challenging as tracer kinetics and relatively high noise can be present in dynamic frames. In this work, we propose an image-based inter-frame motion compensation approach specifically designed for dynamic brain PET imaging. Our method has an iterative implementation that only requires reconstructed images, based on which the inter-frame subject movement can be estimated and compensated. The method utilized tracer-specific kinetic modelling and can deal with simple and complex movement patterns. The synthesized phantom study showed that the proposed method can compensate for the simulated motion in scans with18F-FDG,18F-Fallypride and18F-AV45. Fifteen dynamic18F-FDG patient scans with motion artifacts were also processed. The quality of the recovered image was superior to the one of the non-corrected images and the corrected images with other image-based methods. The proposed method enables retrospective image quality control for dynamic brain PET imaging, hence facilitating the applications of dynamic PET in clinics and research.

TITLE: Does quantification of [11C]meta-hydroxyephedrine and [13N]ammonia kinetics improve risk stratification in ischemic cardiomyopathy

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear cardiology : official publication of the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Background: In ischemic cardiomyopathy patients, cardiac sympathetic nervous system dysfunction is a predictor of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA). This study compared abnormal innervation and perfusion measured by [11C]meta-hydroxyephedrine (HED) vs [13N]ammonia (NH3), conventional uptake vs parametric tracer analysis, and their SCA risk discrimination.

Methods: This is a sub-study analysis of the prospective PAREPET trial, which followed ischemic cardiomyopathy patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF ≤ 35%) for events of SCA. Using n = 174 paired dynamic HED and NH3positron emission tomography (PET) scans, regional defect scores (%LV extent × severity) were calculated using HED and NH3uptake, as well as HED distribution volume and NH3myocardial blood flow by kinetic modeling.

Results: During 4.1 years follow-up, there were 27 SCA events. HED defects were larger than NH3, especially in the lowest tertile of perfusion abnormality (P < .001). Parametric defects were larger than their respective tracer uptake defects (P < .001). SCA risk discrimination was not significantly improved with parametric or uptake mismatch (AUC = 0.73 or 0.70) compared to HED uptake defect scores (AUC = 0.67).

Conclusion: Quantification of HED distribution volume and NH3myocardial blood flow produced larger defects than their respective measures of tracer uptake, but did not lead to improved SCA risk stratification vs HED uptake alone.

AUTHORS: Mika Naganawa, Songye Li, Nabeel Nabulsi, Shannan Henry, Ming-Qiang Zheng, Richard Pracitto, Zhengxin Cai, Hong Gao, Michael Kapinos, David Labaree, David Matuskey, Yiyun Huang, Richard E Carson

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine

ABSTRACT:
The use of synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A radiotracers with PET imaging could provide a way to measure synaptic density quantitatively in living humans.11C-UCB-J ((R)-1-((3-(11C-methyl-11C)pyridin-4-yl)methyl)-4-(3,4,5-trifluorophenyl)pyrrolidin-2-one), previously developed and assessed in nonhuman primates and humans, showed excellent kinetic properties as a PET radioligand. However, it is labeled with the short half-life isotope11C. We developed a new tracer, an18F-labeled difluoro-analog of UCB-J (18F-SynVesT-1, also known as18F-SDM-8), which displayed favorable properties in monkeys. The purpose of this first-in-human study was to assess the kinetic and binding properties of18F-SynVesT-1 and compare with11C-UCB-J.Methods:Eight healthy volunteers participated in a baseline study of18F-SynVesT-1. Four of these subjects were also scanned after a blocking dose of the antiepileptic drug levetiracetam (20 mg/kg). Metabolite-corrected arterial input functions were measured. Regional time-activity curves were analyzed using 1-tissue-compartment (1TC) and 2-tissue-compartment (2TC) models and multilinear analysis 1 to compute total distribution volume (VT) and binding potential (BPND). The centrum semiovale was used as a reference region. The Lassen plot was applied to compute levetiracetam occupancy and nondisplaceable distribution volume. SUV ratio-1 (SUVR-1) over several time windows was compared withBPNDResults:Regional time-activity curves were fitted better with the 2TC model than the 1TC model, but 2TCVTestimates were unstable. The 1TCVTvalues matched well with those from the 2TC model (excluding the unstable values). Thus, 1TC was judged as the most useful model for quantitative analysis of18F-SynVesT-1 imaging data. The minimum scan time for stableVTmeasurement was 60 min. The rank order ofVTandBPNDwas similar between18F-SynVesT-1 and11C-UCB-J. RegionalVTwas slightly higher for11C-UCB-J, butBPNDwas higher for18F-SynVesT-1, though these differences were not significant. Levetiracetam reduced the uptake of18F-SynVesT-1 in all regions and produced occupancy of 85.7%. The SUVR-1 of18F-SynVesT-1 from 60 to 90 min matched best with 1TCBPNDConclusion:The novel synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A tracer,18F-SynVesT-1, displays excellent kinetic and in vivo binding properties in humans and holds great potential for the imaging and quantification of synaptic density in neuropsychiatric disorders.

TITLE: Sustainable Alkaline Hydrolysis of Polyester Fabric at Low Temperature

AUTHORS: Ivana Čorak, Anita Tarbuk, Dragan Đorđević, Ksenija Višić, Lea Botteri

JOURNAL: Materials (Basel, Switzerland)

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
High crystallinity leads to low hydrophilicity of fabric made of (poly(ethylene terephthalate)) fibers (PET) causing problems in finishing, washing, and dyeing processes. To improve these properties, the surface of PET fibers is usually modified by hydrolysis. Alkaline hydrolysis is a conventional process usually performed at a temperature higher than 100 °C for more than 1 h. However, the use of strong alkali and high processing temperatures (>100 °C) can lead to fabric damage and a negative impact on the environment. Therefore, in this paper, the possibility of hydrolysis of the PET fibers in the fabric in a sustainable, energy-efficient process was researched. The influence of low temperature (60-100 °C) and an accelerator (a cationic surfactant HDTMAC) to PET alkaline hydrolysis was studied through weight loss, the loss in breaking force, and fiber morphology. The kinetics of PET dissolution in 1.5 mol cm-3NaOH at low temperature with and without the addition of HDTMAC was determined and the activation energy was calculated according to the theoretical model. It has been confirmed that PET hydrolysis can be carried out in 1.5 mol cm-3NaOH with the addition of HDTMAC as an accelerator at 80 °C for 10 min. This process is more economically and energetically acceptable than the conventional process, and is therefore more sustainable.

TITLE: Synergistic motion compensation strategies for positron emission tomography when acquired simultaneously with magnetic resonance imaging

AUTHORS: Irene Polycarpou, Georgios Soultanidis, Charalampos Tsoumpas

JOURNAL: Philosophical transactions. Series A, Mathematical, physical, and engineering sciences

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Subject motion in positron emission tomography (PET) is a key factor that degrades image resolution and quality, limiting its potential capabilities. Correcting for it is complicated due to the lack of sufficient measured PET data from each position. This poses a significant barrier in calculating the amount of motion occurring during a scan. Motion correction can be implemented at different stages of data processing either during or after image reconstruction, and once applied accurately can substantially improve image quality and information accuracy. With the development of integrated PET-MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scanners, internal organ motion can be measured concurrently with both PET and MRI. In this review paper, we explore the synergistic use of PET and MRI data to correct for any motion that affects the PET images. Different types of motion that can occur during PET-MRI acquisitions are presented and the associated motion detection, estimation and correction methods are reviewed. Finally, some highlights from recent literature in selected human and animal imaging applications are presented and the importance of motion correction for accurate kinetic modelling in dynamic PET-MRI is emphasized. This article is part of the theme issue 'Synergistic tomographic image reconstruction: part 2'.

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine

ABSTRACT:
Parametric imaging has been shown to provide better quantitation physiologically than SUV imaging in PET. With the increased sensitivity from a recently developed total-body PET scanner, whole-body scans with higher temporal resolution become possible for dynamic analysis and parametric imaging. In this paper, we focus on deriving the parameterk1using compartmental modeling and on developing a method to acquire whole-body18F-FDG PET parametric images using only the first 90 s of the postinjection scan data with the total-body PET system.Methods:Dynamic projections were acquired with a time interval of 1 s for the first 30 s and a time interval of 2 s for the following minute. Image-derived input functions were acquired from the reconstructed dynamic sequences in the ascending aorta. A 1-tissue-compartment model with 4 parameters (k1,k2, blood fraction, and delay time) was used. A maximum-likelihood-based estimation method was developed with the 1-tissue-compartment model solution. The accuracy of the acquired parameters was compared with the ones estimated using a 2-tissue-compartment irreversible model with 1-h-long data.Results:All 4 parametric images were successfully calculated using data from 2 volunteers. By comparing the time-activity curves acquired from the volumes of interest, we showed that the parameters estimated using our method were able to predict the time-activity curves of the early dynamics of18F-FDG in different organs. The delay-time effects for different organs were also clearly visible in the reconstructed delay-time image with delay variations of as large as 40 s. The estimated parameters using both 90-s data and 1-h data agreed well fork1and blood fraction, whereas a large difference ink2was found between the 90-s and 1-h data, suggestingk2cannot be reliably estimated from the 90-s scan.Conclusion:We have shown that with total-body PET and the increased sensitivity, it is possible to estimate parametric images based on the very early dynamics after18F-FDG injection. The estimatedk1might potentially be used clinically as an indicator for identifying abnormalities.

Purpose: We report findings from the first-in-human study of [11C]MDTC, a radiotracer developed to image the cannabinoid receptor type 2 (CB2R) with positron emission tomography (PET).

Methods: Ten healthy adults were imaged according to a 90-min dynamic PET protocol after bolus intravenous injection of [11C]MDTC. Five participants also completed a second [11C]MDTC PET scan to assess test-retest reproducibility of receptor-binding outcomes. The kinetic behavior of [11C]MDTC in human brain was evaluated using tissue compartmental modeling. Four additional healthy adults completed whole-body [11C]MDTC PET/CT to calculate organ doses and the whole-body effective dose.

Results: [11C]MDTC brain PET and [11C]MDTC whole-body PET/CT was well-tolerated. A murine study found evidence of brain-penetrant radiometabolites. The model of choice for fitting the time activity curves (TACs) across brain regions of interest was a three-tissue compartment model that includes a separate input function and compartment for the brain-penetrant metabolites. Regional distribution volume (VT) values were low, indicating low CB2R expression in the brain. Test-retest reliability of VTdemonstrated a mean absolute variability of 9.91%. The measured effective dose of [11C]MDTC was 5.29 μSv/MBq.

Conclusion: These data demonstrate the safety and pharmacokinetic behavior of [11C]MDTC with PET in healthy human brain. Future studies identifying radiometabolites of [11C]MDTC are recommended before applying [11C]MDTC PET to assess the high expression of the CB2R by activated microglia in human brain.

TITLE: Imaging Pituitary Vasopressin 1B Receptor in Humans with the PET Radiotracer 11C-TASP699

ABSTRACT:
Arginine vasopressin is a hormone that is synthesized mainly in the hypothalamus and stored in the posterior pituitary. Receptors for vasopressin are categorized into at least 3 subtypes (V1A, V1B, and V2). Among these subtypes, the V1Breceptor (V1BR), highly expressed in the pituitary, is a primary regulator of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity and thus a potential target for treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression and anxiety.N-tert-butyl-2-[2-(6-methoxypyridine-2-yl)-6-[3-(morpholin-4-yl)propoxy]-4-oxopyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidin-3(4H)-yl]acetamide (TASP699) is a novel PET radiotracer with high affinity and selectivity for V1BR. The purpose of this study was to characterize the pharmacokinetic and binding profiles of11C-TASP699 in humans and determine its utility in an occupancy study of a novel V1BR antagonist, TS-121.Methods:Six healthy subjects were scanned twice with11C-TASP699 to determine the most appropriate kinetic model for analysis of imaging data and test-retest reproducibility of outcome measures. Nine healthy subjects were scanned before and after administration of TS-121 (active component: THY1773) to assess V1BR occupancy. Metabolite-corrected arterial input functions were obtained. Pituitary time-activity curves were analyzed with 1- and 2-tissue-compartment (1TC and 2TC, respectively) models and multilinear analysis 1 (MA1) to calculate distribution volume (VT). Relative test-retest variability (TRV) and absolute TRV were calculated. Since no brain region could be used as a reference region, percentage change inVTafter TS-121 administration was computed to assess its receptor occupancy and correlate with plasma concentrations of the drug.Results:11C-TASP699 showed high uptake in the pituitary and no uptake in any brain region. The 2TC model provided better fits than the 1TC model. Because the MA1VTestimates were similar to the 2TCVTestimates, MA1 was the model of choice. The TRV ofVTwas good (TRV, -2% ± 14%; absolute TRV, 11%). THY1773 reducedVTin a dose-dependent fashion, with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration of 177 ± 52 ng/mL in plasma concentration. There were no adverse events resulting in discontinuation from the study.Conclusion:11C-TASP699 was shown to display appropriate kinetics in humans, with substantial specific binding and good reproducibility ofVTTherefore, this tracer is suitable for measurement of V1BR in the human pituitary and the V1BR occupancy of TS-121, a novel V1BR antagonist.

ABSTRACT:
Receptor occupancy (RO) studies using PET neuroimaging play a critical role in the development of drugs targeting the central nervous system (CNS). The conventional approach to estimate drug receptor occupancy consists in estimation of binding potential changes between two PET scans (baseline and post-drug injection). This estimation is typically performed separately for each scan by first reconstructing dynamic PET scan data before fitting a kinetic model to time activity curves. This approach fails to properly model the noise in PET measurements, resulting in poor RO estimates, especially in low receptor density regions.

Objective: In this work, we evaluate a novel joint direct parametric reconstruction framework to directly estimate distributions of RO and other kinetic parameters in the brain from a pair of baseline and post-drug injection dynamic PET scans.

Methods: The proposed method combines the use of regularization on RO maps with alternating optimization to enable estimation of occupancy even in low binding regions.

Results: Simulation results demonstrate the quantitative improvement of this method over conventional approaches in terms of accuracy and precision of occupancy. The proposed method is also evaluated in preclinical in-vivo experiments using 11C-MK-6884 and a muscarinic acetylcholine receptor 4 positive allosteric modulator drug, showing improved estimation of receptor occupancy as compared to traditional estimators.

Conclusion: The proposed joint direct estimation framework improves RO estimation compared to conventional methods, especially in intermediate to low-binding regions.

Significance: This work could potentially facilitate the evaluation of new drug candidates targeting the CNS.

ABSTRACT:
68Ga-citrate has one of the simplest chemical structures of all68Ga-radiopharmaceuticals, and its clinical use is justified by the proven medical applications using its isotope-labeled compound67Ga-citrate. To support broader application of68Ga-citrate in medical diagnosis, further research is needed to gain clinical data from healthy volunteers. In this work, we studied the biodistribution of68Ga-citrate and subsequent radiation exposure from it in healthy men.Methods:68Ga-citrate was prepared with an acetone-based radiolabeling procedure compliant with good manufacturing practices. Six healthy men (age 41 ± 12 y, mean ± SD) underwent sequential whole-body PET/CT scans after an injection of 204 ± 8 MBq of68Ga-citrate. Serial arterialized venous blood samples were collected during PET imaging, and the radioactivity concentration was measured with a γ-counter. Urinary voids were collected and measured. The MIRD bladder-voiding model with a 3.5-h voiding interval was used. A model using a 70-kg adult man and the MIRD schema was used to estimate absorbed doses in target organs and effective doses. Calculations were performed using OLINDA/EXM software, version 2.0.Results:Radioactivity clearance from the blood was slow, and relatively high radioactivity concentrations were observed over the whole of the 3-h measuring period. Although radioactivity excretion via urine was rather slow (biologic half-time, 69 ± 24 h), the highest decay-corrected concentrations in urinary bladder contents were measured at the 90- and 180-min time points. Moderate concentrations were also seen in kidneys, liver, and spleen. The source organs showing the largest residence times were muscle, liver, lung, and heart contents. The heart wall received the highest absorbed dose, 0.077 ± 0.008 mSv/MBq. The mean effective dose (International Commission on Radiological Protection publication 103) was 0.021 ± 0.001 mSv/MBq.Conclusion:PET imaging with68Ga-citrate is associated with modest radiation exposure. A 200-MBq injection of68Ga-citrate results in an effective radiation dose of 4.2 mSv, which is in the same range as other68Ga-labeled tracers. This suggests the feasibility of clinical studies using68Ga-citrate imaging in humans and the possibility of performing multiple scans in the same subjects across the course of a year.

TITLE: The feasibility of ultralow-activity 18F-FDG dynamic PET imaging in lung adenocarcinoma patients through total-body PET/CT scanner

AUTHORS: Jing Lv, Hongyan Yin, Haojun Yu, Guobing Liu, Hongcheng Shi

JOURNAL: Annals of nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Objective: To explore the feasibility of ultralow-activity18F-FDG total-body dynamic PET imaging for clinical practice in patients with lung adenocarcinoma.

Methods: Eight of 18 patients were randomly injected with18F-FDG with full activity (3.7 MBq/kg) for total-body dynamic PET imaging, while 10 received one-tenth activity (0.37 MBq/kg). The generated time-to-activity curves (TACs) according to the regions of interest (ROIs) were processed by PMOD through standard FDG two-tissue compartment model fitting. The kinetic constant rates (K1, K2, K3, and Ki), radiation dose, prompt counts, and data storage size were analysed between the full- and ultralow-activity groups. The SUVmax-Tumour/SUVmax-Liver and SUVmax-Tumour/SUVmax-Muscle on static PET images were also assessed.

Results: Each of the fitted models has a satisfactory goodness-of-fit with R2greater than 0.9 except 3 (3/234) in ultralow-activity group, where one in pancreas (R2= 0.851), another one in muscle (R2= 0.868), and the third one in bone marrow (R2= 0.895). All the fitted models in the full-activity group had a better goodness-of-fit than those in the ultralow-activity group. However, no significant differences were found in any of the kinetic metrics or image quality between the two groups except in the reduction of radiation dose and data storage size.

Conclusions: The 10 × reduction of injected18F-FDG could achieve comparable kinetic metrics and T/N ratios by total-body dynamic PET imaging in lung adenocarcinoma patients. Ultralow-activity total-body PET imaging is feasible for clinical practice in oncological patients without obesity, especially in dynamic PET scanning.

TITLE: Modeling of a population-based input function (PBIF) using the Feng model in dynamic ⁶⁸Ga-DOTATOC whole body PET/CT scans: feasibility of shortened imaging protocols on PET/CT Vision 600 system ®

AUTHORS: Thomas Godefroy, Mathieu Pavoine, David Bourhis, Romain Le Pennec, Kevin Kerleguer, Romain Floch, Pierre-Yves Salaün, Nicolas Karakatsanis, Philippe Thuillier, Ronan Abgral

JOURNAL: EJNMMI physics

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Background: This study focuses on modeling a population-based input function (PBIF) in dynamic ⁶⁸Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT exams, with the aim of developing clinically adoptable protocols. The PBIF is derived from an image-derived input function (IDIF), ensuring a non-invasive and standardized approach to tracer kinetic modeling.

Methods: Patients with well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors were included from the GAPETNET clinical trial (n = 37), divided into a PBIF modeling group (n = 20) and an independent validation group (n = 17). Dynamic whole-body (dWB) PET/CT imaging was performed using a Vision 600 PET/CT system. A population-based input function (PBIF) was modeled using the Feng approach and scaled to individual patient-specific IDIFs over two different time windows (sPBIF3 - 7: 25-55 min, sPBIF5 - 7: 40-55 min). The scaled PBIF was normalized to IDIF data from 6 to 55 min post-injection. A full individual patient-specific IDIF using data from 0 to 70 min post-injectionwas used as the reference for AUC and Ki comparisons. IDIFs and scaled PBIFs were compared by assessing the area under the curve (AUC) and radiotracer influx rate (Ki). Linear correlation and Bland-Altman analyses were conducted for AUC and Ki comparisons. Additionally, Mann-Whitney tests were performed to compare Ki values obtained with IDIF and sPBIF in both tumoral lesions and physiological organs.

Results: The lowest mean relative AUC bias was observed with sPBIF3 - 7, calculated to be 2.7 ± 7.9%, and was slightly higher with sPBIF5 - 7(7.35 ± 8.58%). The correlation coefficient (R²) with the sPBIFs was high, with a minimum of 0.95 for the sPBIF5 - 7. When analyzing Kimetrics, biases tended to be lower with the 40-55 min time window (Mean ± SD bias = 1.61 ± 3.33 for Ki maxand 1.64 ± 2.96 for Ki mean). No significant differences in Kivalues was observed with the sPBIFs compared to the IDIF (p > 0.05), for either tumoral lesion or physiological organs.

Conclusion: Our study has demonstrated the feasibility the PBIF approach to estimate tumor or physiological Ki values from a shortened dWB ⁶⁸Ga-DOTATOC PET acquisition, using the Feng model.

ABSTRACT:
As is the case for many others in the world, Mexican seas face complex pollution challenges; two of the contaminants that require special attention for their prevalence, possible chemical interactions, and relation to the country's economy are leaked petroleum and microplastics (MP). This research assessed the sorption of total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) as fuel oil on microplastics in laboratory and field scenarios. Preliminary tests allowed the development and validation of a methodology to measure the sorbed fuel oil by Soxhlet extraction, with a 99.65% recovery rate. The amount of TPH sorbed in the lab followed the order LDPE > PS > PP > PVC > PET > HDPE, with the highest concentration found on LDPE. The sorption of fuel oil on microplastics is correlated to the surface area of the plastic particles and could also be related to the crystallinity of plastics. Sorption, for all plastics, was consistent with a second-order kinetic model. The analysis of field samples collected on beaches of the Gulf of Mexico varied from 1660 to 35,258 mg/kg MP. It must be noticed that, unlike others, this research quantified a family of contaminants, which could explain the high concentrations observed on microplastics.

TITLE: Plasma radio-metabolite analysis of PET tracers for dynamic PET imaging: TLC and autoradiography

AUTHORS: Fiona Li, Justin W Hicks, Lihai Yu, Lise Desjardin, Laura Morrison, Jennifer Hadway, Ting-Yim Lee

JOURNAL: EJNMMI research

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Background: In molecular imaging with dynamic PET, the binding and dissociation of a targeted tracer is characterized by kinetics modeling which requires the arterial concentration of the tracer to be measured accurately. Once in the body the radiolabeled parent tracer may be subjected to hydrolysis, demethylation/dealkylation and other biochemical processes, resulting in the production and accumulation of different metabolites in blood which can be labeled with the same PET radionuclide as the parent. Since these radio-metabolites cannot be distinguished by PET scanning from the parent tracer, their contribution to the arterial concentration curve has to be removed for the accurate estimation of kinetic parameters from kinetic analysis of dynamic PET. High-performance liquid chromatography has been used to separate and measure radio-metabolites in blood plasma; however, the method is labor intensive and remains a challenge to implement for each individual patient. The purpose of this study is to develop an alternate technique based on thin layer chromatography (TLC) and a sensitive commercial autoradiography system (Beaver, Ai4R, Nantes, France) to measure radio-metabolites in blood plasma of two targeted tracers-[18F]FAZA and [18F]FEPPA, for imaging hypoxia and inflammation, respectively.

Results: Radioactivity as low as 17 Bq in 2 µL of pig's plasma can be detected on the TLC plate using autoradiography. Peaks corresponding to the parent tracer and radio-metabolites could be distinguished in the line profile through each sample (n = 8) in the autoradiographic image. Significant intersubject and intra-subject variability in radio-metabolites production could be observed with both tracers. For [18F]FEPPA, 50% of plasma activity was from radio-metabolites as early as 5-min post injection, while for [18F]FAZA, significant metabolites did not appear until 50-min post. Simulation study investigating the effect of radio-metabolite in the estimation of kinetic parameters indicated that 32-400% parameter error can result without radio-metabolites correction.

Conclusion: TLC coupled with autoradiography is a good alternative to high-performance liquid chromatography for radio-metabolite correction. The advantages of requiring only small blood samples (~ 100 μL) and of analyzing multiple samples simultaneously, make the method suitable for individual dynamic PET studies.

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Estrogen receptors (ER) are implicated in psychiatric disorders. We assessed if ER availability in the human brain could be quantified using 16α-[18F]-fluoro-17β-estradiol ([18F]FES) positron emission tomography (PET).

Procedures: Seven post‑menopausal women underwent a dynamic [18F]FES PET scan with arterial blood sampling. A T1-weighted MRI was acquired for anatomical information. After one week, four subjects received a selective ER degrader (SERD), four hours before the PET scan. Pharmacokinetic analysis was performed using a metabolite-corrected plasma curve as the input function. The optimal kinetic model was selected based on the Akaike information criterion and standard error of estimated parameters. Accuracy of Logan graphical analysis and standardized uptake value (SUV) was determined via correlational analyses.

Results: The reversible two-tissue compartment model (2T4k) model with fixed K1/k2was preferred. The total volume of distribution (VT) could be more reliably estimated than the binding potential (BPND). A high correlation of VTwith Logan graphical analysis was observed, but only a moderate correlation with SUV. SERD administration resulted in a reduced VTin the pituitary gland, but not in other regions.

Conclusions: The optimal quantification method for [18F]FES was the 2T4k with fixed K1/k2or Logan graphical analysis, but specific binding was only observed in the pituitary gland.

TITLE: Parametric mapping for 11C-metomidate PET-computed tomography imaging in the study of primary aldosteronism

AUTHORS: Jim O' Doherty, Sophie O' Doherty, Edward G Robins, Anthonin Reilhac

JOURNAL: Nuclear medicine communications

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Objective: 11C-metomidate (11C-MTO) PET-computed tomography (CT) imaging has shown good sensitivity and specificity for the classification of bilateral or unilateral overexpression of aldosterone. This work seeks to investigate the usefulness of parametric maps via kinetic modeling of 11C-metomidate data into the clinical diagnosis pathway.

Methods: Twenty-five patients were injected with 172 ± 12 MBq of 11C-metomidate and a dynamic PET scan performed of the adrenal glands. A blood time-activity curve was drawn from a volume of interest in the left ventricle and converted to a plasma time-activity curve. Metabolite correction was performed with a population-based correction. We performed regional-based graphical Patlak analysis to calculate the regional uptake rate constant Ki(REG), and also calculated parametric maps of Ki(VOX) using a voxel-based technique.

Results: Comparison of Ki(REG), and the maximum lesion voxel from parametric maps Ki(mVOX) demonstrated a high correlation for all subjects (r2 = 0.96). Ki(mVOX) allowed differentiation between cases of active and inactive unilateral adenoma when compared to bilateral hyperplasia (P < 0.017), a feature not observed with standardized uptake ratios (SUVmax) analysis. Ki(mVOX) demonstrated a poor correlation of 0.68 with SUVmax, indicating the differences through the use of static and dynamic imaging. Three false-negative cases based on SUV analysis indicated that Ki(mVOX) was able to successfully differentiate the clinical presentation for these cases.

Conclusion: Our work demonstrates that parametric Ki(VOX) was able to successfully differentiate between patients with bilateral hyperplasia and patients with unilateral adrenal adenoma in our cohort and that Ki may be considered be an additional useful metric to SUV in 11C-metomidate PET-CT imaging.

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Background: Myocardial flow reserve (MFR) measurement provides incremental diagnostic and prognostic information. The objective of the current study was to investigate the application of a simplified model for the estimation of MFR using only the stress/rest myocardial activity ratio (MAR) in patients undergoing rest-stress cardiac PET MPI.

Methods and results: Rest and dipyridamole stress dynamic PET imaging was performed in consecutive patients using82Rb or13NH3(n = 250 each). Reference standard MFR was quantified using a standard one-tissue compartment model. Stress/rest myocardial activity ratio (MAR) was calculated using the LV-mean activity from 2 to 6 minutes post-injection. Simplified estimates of MFR (MFREST) were then calculated using an inverse power function. For13NH3, there was good correlation between MFR and MFRESTvalues (R = 0.63), with similar results for82Rb (R = 0.73). There was no bias in the MFRESTvalues with either tracer. The overall diagnostic performance of MFRESTfor detection of MFR < 2 was good with ROC area under the curve (AUC) = 83.2 ± 1.2% for13NH3and AUC = 90.4 ± 0.7% for82Rb.

Conclusion: MFR was estimated with good accuracy using82Rb and13NH3with a simplified method that relies only on stress/rest activity ratios. This novel approach does not require dynamic imaging or tracer kinetic modeling. It may be useful for routine quality assurance of PET MFR measurements, or in scanners where full dynamic imaging and tracer kinetic modeling is not feasible for technical or logistical reasons.

TITLE: Dispersion-corrected extracorporeal arterial input functions in PET studies of mice: a comparison to intracorporeal microprobe measurements

AUTHORS: Juela Cufe, Florian Gierse, Klaus P Schäfers, Sven Hermann, Michael A Schäfers, Philipp Backhaus, Florian Büther

JOURNAL: EJNMMI research

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Background: Kinetic modelling of dynamic PET typically requires knowledge of the arterial radiotracer concentration (arterial input function, AIF). Its accurate determination is very difficult in mice. AIF measurements in an extracorporeal shunt can be performed; however, this introduces catheter dispersion. We propose a framework for extracorporeal dispersion correction and validated it by comparison to invasively determined intracorporeal AIFs using implanted microprobes.

Results: The response of an extracorporeal radiation detector to radioactivity boxcar functions, characterised by a convolution-based dispersion model, gave best fits using double-gamma variate and single-gamma variate kernels compared to mono-exponential kernels for the investigated range of flow rates. Parametric deconvolution with the optimal kernels was performed on 9 mice that were injected with a bolus of 39 ± 25 MBq [18F]F-PSMA-1007 after application of an extracorporeal circulation for three different flow rates in order to correct for dispersion. Comparison with synchronous implantation of microprobes for invasive aortic AIF recordings showed favourable correspondence, with no significant difference in terms of area-under-curve after 300 s and 5000 s. One-tissue and two-tissue compartment model simulations were performed to investigate differences in kinetic parameters between intra- and extracorporeally measured AIFs. Results of the modelling study revealed kinetic parameters close to the chosen simulated values in all compartment models.

Conclusion: The high correspondence of simultaneously intra- and extracorporeally determined AIFs and resulting model parameters establishes a feasible framework for extracorporeal dispersion correction. This should allow more precise and accurate kinetic modelling in small animal experiments.

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Existing methods for voxelwise transient dopamine (DA) release detection rely on explicit kinetic modeling of the [11C]raclopride PET time activity curve, which at the voxel level is typically confounded by noise, leading to poor performance for detection of low-amplitude DA release-induced signals. Here we present a novel data-driven, task-informed method-referred to as Residual Space Detection (RSD)-that transforms PET time activity curves to a residual space where DA release-induced perturbations can be isolated and processed. Using simulations, we demonstrate that this method significantly increases detection performance compared to existing kinetic model-based methods for low-magnitude DA release (simulated +100% peak increase in basal DA concentration). In addition, results from nine healthy controls injected with a single bolus of [11C]raclopride performing a finger tapping motor task are shown as proof-of-concept. The ability to detect relatively low magnitudes of dopamine release in the human brain using a single bolus injection, while achieving higher statistical power than previous methods, may additionally enable more complex analyses of neurotransmitter systems. Moreover, RSD is readily generalizable to multiple tasks performed during a single PET scan, further extending the capabilities of task-based single-bolus protocols.

TITLE: 177Lu-DOTATATE Theranostics: Predicting Renal Dosimetry From Pretherapy 68Ga-DOTATATE PET and Clinical Biomarkers

AUTHORS: Avery B Peterson, Chang Wang, Ka Kit Wong, Kirk A Frey, Otto Muzik, Matthew J Schipper, Yuni K Dewaraja

JOURNAL: Clinical nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Pretreatment predictions of absorbed doses can be especially valuable for patient selection and dosimetry-guided individualization of radiopharmaceutical therapy. Our goal was to build regression models using pretherapy 68Ga-DOTATATE PET uptake data and other baseline clinical factors/biomarkers to predict renal absorbed dose delivered by 177Lu-DOTATATE peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (177Lu-PRRT) for neuroendocrine tumors. We explore the combination of biomarkers and 68Ga PET uptake metrics, hypothesizing that they will improve predictive power over univariable regression.

Patients and methods: Pretherapy 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CTs were analyzed for 25 patients (50 kidneys) who also underwent quantitative 177Lu SPECT/CT imaging at approximately 4, 24, 96, and 168 hours after cycle 1 of 177Lu-PRRT. Kidneys were contoured on the CT of the PET/CT and SPECT/CT using validated deep learning-based tools. Dosimetry was performed by coupling the multi-time point SPECT/CT images with an in-house Monte Carlo code. Pretherapy renal PET SUV metrics, activity concentration per injected activity (Bq/mL/MBq), and other baseline clinical factors/biomarkers were investigated as predictors of the 177Lu SPECT/CT-derived mean absorbed dose per injected activity to the kidneys using univariable and bivariable models. Leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) was used to estimate model performance using root mean squared error and absolute percent error in predicted renal absorbed dose including mean absolute percent error (MAPE) and associated standard deviation (SD).

Results: The median therapy-delivered renal dose was 0.5 Gy/GBq (range, 0.2-1.0 Gy/GBq). In LOOCV of univariable models, PET uptake (Bq/mL/MBq) performs best with MAPE of 18.0% (SD = 13.3%), and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) gives an MAPE of 28.5% (SD = 19.2%). Bivariable regression with both PET uptake and eGFR gives LOOCV MAPE of 17.3% (SD = 11.8%), indicating minimal improvement over univariable models.

Conclusions: Pretherapy 68Ga-DOTATATE PET renal uptake can be used to predict post-177Lu-PRRT SPECT-derived mean absorbed dose to the kidneys with accuracy within 18%, on average. Compared with PET uptake alone, including eGFR in the same model to account for patient-specific kinetics did not improve predictive power. Following further validation of these preliminary findings in an independent cohort, predictions using renal PET uptake can be used in the clinic for patient selection and individualization of treatment before initiating the first cycle of PRRT.

ABSTRACT:
The environmental impact arising from poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) waste is notable worldwide. Enzymatic PET hydrolysis can provide chemicals that serve as intermediates for value-added product synthesis and savings in the resources. In the present work, some reaction parameters were evaluated on the hydrolysis of post-consumer PET (PC-PET) using a cutinase from Humicola insolens (HiC). The increase in PC-PET specific area leads to an 8.5-fold increase of the initial enzymatic hydrolysis rate (from 0.2 to 1.7 mmol L-1h-1), showing that this parameter plays a crucial role in PET hydrolysis reaction. The effect of HiC concentration was investigated, and the enzymatic PC-PET hydrolysis kinetic parameters were estimated based on three different mathematical models describing heterogeneous biocatalysis. The model that best fits the experimental data (R2= 0.981) indicated 1.68 mgproteinmL-1as a maximum value of the enzyme concentration to optimize the reaction rate. The HiC thermal stability was evaluated, considering that it is a key parameter for its efficient use in PET degradation. The enzyme half-life was shown to be 110 h at 70 ºC and pH 7.0, which outperforms most of the known enzymes displaying PET hydrolysis activity. The results evidence that HiC is a very promising biocatalyst for efficient PET depolymerization.

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Synapse loss is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and correlates with cognitive decline. The validation of a noninvasive in vivo imaging approach to quantify synapse would greatly facilitate our understanding of AD pathogenesis and assist drug developments for AD. As animal models of neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders play a critical role in the drug discovery and development process, a robust, objective, and translational method for quantifying therapeutic drug efficacy in animal models will facilitate the drug development process. In this study, we tested the quantification reliability of the SV2A PET tracer, [18F]SynVesT-1, in a mouse model of AD (APP/PS1) and wild-type controls, and developed a simplified quantification method to facilitate large cohort preclinical imaging studies.

Procedures: We generated nondisplaceable binding potential (BPND) and distribution volume ratio (DVR) values using the simplified reference tissue model (SRTM) on the 90-min dynamic PET imaging data, with brain stem and cerebellum as the reference region, respectively. Then, we correlated the standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR)-1 and SUVR averaged from different imaging windows with BPNDand DVR, using brain stem and cerebellum as the reference region, respectively. We performed homologous competitive binding assay and autoradiographic saturation binding assay using [18F]SynVesT-1 to calculate the Bmaxand Kd.

Results: Using brain stem as the reference region, the averaged SUVR-1 from 30 to 60 min postinjection correlated well with the BPNDcalculated using SRTM. Using cerebellum as the reference region, the averaged SUVR from 30 to 60 min postinjection correlated well with the SRTM DVR. From the homologous competitive binding assay and autoradiographic saturation binding assay, the calculated the Bmaxand Kdwere 4.5-18 pmol/mg protein and 9.8-19.6 nM, respectively, for rodent brain tissue.

Conclusions: This simplified SUVR method provides reasonable SV2A measures in APP/PS1 mice and their littermate controls. Our data indicate that, in lieu of a full 90-min dynamic scan, a 30-min static PET scan (from 30 to 60 min postinjection) would be sufficient to provide quantification data on SV2A expression, equivalent to the data generated from kinetic modeling. The methods developed here are readily applicable to the evaluation of therapeutic effects of novel drugs in this rodent model using [18F]SynVesT-1 and small animal PET.

TITLE: Motion correction and its impact on quantification in dynamic total-body 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET

ABSTRACT:
Background: The total-body positron emission tomography (PET) scanner provides an unprecedented opportunity to scan the whole body simultaneously, thanks to its long axial field of view and ultrahigh temporal resolution. To fully utilize this potential in clinical settings, a dynamic scan would be necessary to obtain the desired kinetic information from scan data. However, in a long dynamic acquisition, patient movement can degrade image quality and quantification accuracy.

Methods: In this work, we demonstrated a motion correction framework and its importance in dynamic total-body FDG PET imaging. Dynamic FDG scans from 12 subjects acquired on a uEXPLORER PET/CT were included. In these subjects, 7 are healthy subjects and 5 are those with tumors in the thorax and abdomen. All scans were contaminated by motion to some degree, and for each the list-mode data were reconstructed into 1-min frames. The dynamic frames were aligned to a reference position by sequentially registering each frame to its previous neighboring frame. We parametrized the motion fields in-between frames as diffeomorphism, which can map the shape change of the object smoothly and continuously in time and space. Diffeomorphic representations of motion fields were derived by registering neighboring frames using large deformation diffeomorphic metric matching. When all pairwise registrations were completed, the motion field at each frame was obtained by concatenating the successive motion fields and transforming that frame into the reference position. The proposed correction method was labeled SyN-seq. The method that was performed similarly, but aligned each frame to a designated middle frame, was labeled as SyN-mid. Instead of SyN, the method that performed the sequential affine registration was labeled as Aff-seq. The original uncorrected images were labeled as NMC. Qualitative and quantitative analyses were performed to compare the performance of the proposed method with that of other correction methods and uncorrected images.

Results: The results indicated that visual improvement was achieved after correction of the SUV images for the motion present period, especially in the brain and abdomen. For subjects with tumors, the average improvement in tumor SUVmean was 5.35 ± 4.92% (P = 0.047), with a maximum improvement of 12.89%. An overall quality improvement in quantitative Kiimages was also observed after correction; however, such improvement was less obvious in K1images. Sampled time-activity curves in the cerebral and kidney cortex were less affected by the motion after applying the proposed correction. Mutual information and dice coefficient relative to the reference also demonstrated that SyN-seq improved the alignment between frames over non-corrected images (P = 0.003 and P = 0.011). Moreover, the proposed correction successfully reduced the inter-subject variability in Kiquantifications (11.8% lower in sampled organs). Subjective assessment by experienced radiologists demonstrated consistent results for both SUV images and Kiimages.

Conclusion: To conclude, motion correction is important for image quality in dynamic total-body PET imaging. We demonstrated a correction framework that can effectively reduce the effect of random body movements on dynamic images and their associated quantification. The proposed correction framework can potentially benefit applications that require total-body assessment, such as imaging the brain-gut axis and systemic diseases.

ABSTRACT:
Introduction:Dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) and the application of kinetic models can provide important quantitative information based on its temporal information. This however requires arterial blood sampling, which can be challenging to acquire. Nowadays, state-of-the-art PET/CT systems offer fully automated, whole-body (WB) kinetic modelling protocols using image-derived input functions (IDIF) to replace arterial blood sampling. Here, we compared the validity of an automatic WB kinetic model protocol to the reference standard arterial input function (AIF) for both clinical and research settings.Methods:Sixteen healthy participants underwent dynamic WB [18F]FDG scans using a continuous bed motion PET/CT system with simultaneous arterial blood sampling. Multiple processing pipelines that included automatic and manually generated IDIFs derived from the aorta and left ventricle, with and without motion correction were compared to the AIF. Subsequently generated quantitative images of glucose metabolism were compared to evaluate performance of the different input functions.Results:We observed moderate to high correlations between IDIFs and the AIF regarding area under the curve (r = 0.49-0.89) as well as for the cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (CMRGlu) (r = 0.68-0.95). Manual placing of IDIFs and motion correction further improved their similarity to the AIF.Discussion:In general, the automatic vendor protocol is a feasible approach for the quantification of CMRGlu for both, clinical and research settings where expertise or time is not available. However, we advise on a rigorous inspection of the placement of the volume of interest, the resulting IDIF, and the quantitative values to ensure valid interpretations. In protocols requiring longer scan times or where cohorts are prone to involuntary movement, manual IDIF definition with additional motion correction is recommended, as this has greater accuracy and reliability.

JOURNAL: Journal of clinical medicine

ABSTRACT:
Background: Static [18F]FDG-PET/CT is the imaging method of choice for the evaluation of indeterminate lung lesions and NSCLC staging; however, histological confirmation of PET-positive lesions is needed in most cases due to its limited specificity. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of additional dynamic whole-body PET.

Methods: A total of 34 consecutive patients with indeterminate pulmonary lesions were enrolled in this prospective trial. All patients underwent static (60 min p.i.) and dynamic (0-60 min p.i.) whole-body [18F]FDG-PET/CT (300 MBq) using the multi-bed-multi-timepoint technique (Siemens mCT FlowMotion). Histology and follow-up served as ground truth. Kinetic modeling factors were calculated using a two-compartment linear Patlak model (FDG influx rate constant = Ki, metabolic rate = MR-FDG, distribution volume = DV-FDG) and compared to SUV using ROC analysis.

Results: MR-FDGmeanprovided the best discriminatory power between benign and malignant lung lesions with an AUC of 0.887. The AUC of DV-FDGmean(0.818) and SUVmean(0.827) was non-significantly lower. For LNM, the AUCs for MR-FDGmean(0.987) and SUVmean(0.993) were comparable. Moreover, the DV-FDGmeanin liver metastases was three times higher than in bone or lung metastases.

Conclusions: Metabolic rate quantification was shown to be a reliable method to detect malignant lung tumors, LNM, and distant metastases at least as accurately as the established SUV or dual-time-point PET scans.

ABSTRACT:
Nanoporous track-etched membranes (TeM) are promising materials as adsorbents to remove toxic pollutants, but control over the pore diameter and density in addition to precise functionalization of nanochannels is crucial for controlling the surface area and efficiency of TeMs. This study reported the synthesis of functionalized PET TeMs as high-capacity sorbents for the removal of trivalent arsenic, As(III), which is more mobile and about 60 times more toxic than As(V). Nanochannels of PET-TeMs were functionalized by UV-initiated reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT)-mediated grafting of 2-(dimethyamino)ethyl methacrylate (DMAEMA), allowing precise control of the degree of grafting and graft lengths within the nanochannels. Ag NPs were then loaded onto PDMAEMA-g-PET to provide a hybrid sorbent for As(III) removal. The As(III) removal efficiency of Ag@PDMAEMA-g-PET, PDMAEMA-g-PET, and pristine PET TeM was compared by adsorption kinetics studies at various pH and sorption times. The adsorption of As(III) by Ag@DMAEMA-g-PET and DMAEMA-g-PET TeMs was found to follow the Freundlich mechanism and a pseudo-second-order kinetic model. After 10 h, As(III) removal efficiencies were 85.6% and 56% for Ag@PDMAEMA-g-PET and PDMAEMA-g-PET, respectively, while PET template had a very low arsenic sorption capacity of 17.5% at optimal pH of 4.0, indicating that both PDMAEMA grafting and Ag-NPs loading significantly increased the As(III) removal capacity of PET-TeMs.

ABSTRACT:
Diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPG), the first cause of cerebral pediatric cancer death, will greatly benefit from specific and non-invasive biomarkers for patient follow-up and monitoring of drug efficacy. Since biopsies are challenging for brain tumors, molecular imaging may be a technique of choice to target and follow tumor evolution. So far, MR remains the imaging technique of reference for DIPG, although it often fails to define the extent of tumors, an essential parameter for therapeutic efficacy assessment. Thanks to its high sensitivity, positron emission tomography (PET) offers a unique way to target specific biomarkers in vivo. We demonstrated in a patient-derived orthotopic xenograft (PDOX) model in the rat that the translocator protein of 18 kDa (TSPO) may be a promising biomarker for monitoring DIPG tumors. We studied the distribution of 18F-DPA-714, a TSPO radioligand, in rats inoculated with HSJD-DIPG-007 cells. The primary DIPG human cell line HSJD-DIPG-007 highly represents this pediatric tumor, displaying the most prevalent DIPG mutations, H3F3A (K27M) and ACVR1 (R206H). Kinetic modeling and parametric imaging using the brain 18F-DPA-714 PET data enabled specific delineation of the DIPG tumor area, which is crucial for radiotherapy dose management.

TITLE: Radiogenomic analysis of primary breast cancer reveals [18F]-fluorodeoxglucose dynamic flux-constants are positively associated with immune pathways and outperform static uptake measures in associating with glucose metabolism

JOURNAL: Breast cancer research : BCR

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Background: PET imaging of 18F-fluorodeoxygucose (FDG) is used widely for tumour staging and assessment of treatment response, but the biology associated with FDG uptake is still not fully elucidated. We therefore carried out gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA) of RNA sequencing data to find KEGG pathways associated with FDG uptake in primary breast cancers.

Methods: Pre-treatment data were analysed from a window-of-opportunity study in which 30 patients underwent static and dynamic FDG-PET and tumour biopsy. Kinetic models were fitted to dynamic images, and GSEA was performed for enrichment scores reflecting Pearson and Spearman coefficients of correlations between gene expression and imaging.

Results: A total of 38 pathways were associated with kinetic model flux-constants or static measures of FDG uptake, all positively. The associated pathways included glycolysis/gluconeogenesis ('GLYC-GLUC') which mediates FDG uptake and was associated with model flux-constants but not with static uptake measures, and 28 pathways related to immune-response or inflammation. More pathways, 32, were associated with the flux-constant K of the simple Patlak model than with any other imaging index. Numbers of pathways categorised as being associated with individual micro-parameters of the kinetic models were substantially fewer than numbers associated with flux-constants, and lay around levels expected by chance.

Conclusions: In pre-treatment images GLYC-GLUC was associated with FDG kinetic flux-constants including Patlak K, but not with static uptake measures. Immune-related pathways were associated with flux-constants and static uptake. Patlak K was associated with more pathways than were the flux-constants of more complex kinetic models. On the basis of these results Patlak analysis of dynamic FDG-PET scans is advantageous, compared to other kinetic analyses or static imaging, in studies seeking to infer tumour-to-tumour differences in biology from differences in imaging.

TITLE: Value of whole-body dynamic 18F-FMISO PET/CT Patlak multi-parameter imaging for evaluating the early radiosensitizing effect of oleanolic acid on C6 rat gliomas

AUTHORS: Ke Cai, Qingqing Zhang, Hui Wang, Wenjing Yu, Yangyang Xue, Huiqin Xu

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
The purpose of this study was to investigate the value of tumour-to-muscle (T/M) ratios and Patlak Ki images extracted from whole-body dynamic18F-fluoromisonidazole (FMISO) PET/CT Patlak multi-parameter imaging for evaluating the early radiosensitizing effect of oleanolic acid (OA). Twenty-four rats with C6 gliomas were divided into 4 groups and treated with OA (group B), radiotherapy (group C), both (group D) or neither (group A). Whole-body dynamic18F-FMISO PET/CT scans were performed for 120 min before treatment and 24 h following the treatment course. The tumour samples were dissected for hematoxylin and eosin staining, and HIF-1α, Ki-67 and GLUT-1 immunohistochemical staining. PET images were analysed using kinetic modelling (Patlak Ki) and static analysis (T/M ratios), and correlated with immunohistochemical results. The changes in T/M ratios, Ki values and tumour volume before treatment and 24 h following the treatment course were compared, and the survival time of tumour-bearing rats was recorded. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that OA combined with radiotherapy can inhibit tumour growth and prolong the survival time of tumour-bearing rats. Whole-body dynamic18F-FMISO PET/CT showed that the Ki values in group D were significantly lower than those in group C, whilst there was no significant difference in T/M ratios between groups C and D. The Pearson correlation coefficient analysis showed that Ki values were significantly related to immunohistochemical results. Our study suggests that Patlak Ki images may add value to PET/CT static images for evaluating the early radio-sensitizing effect of OA.

ABSTRACT:
The metal contamination and the degradation of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) due to human activities have contributed to the worsening of environmental problems in aquatic systems. Therefore, the study aimed to evaluate PET microplastic adsorption levels when exposed to high amounts of Ni, Cu and Co. The PET microplastic was characterized by scanning electron microscopy, Brunner-Emmet-Teller, porosimetry system, Barrett-Joyner-Halenda and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy with attenuated total reflectance for evaluation of surface morphology, surface area, porosity, pore size and functional groups, respectively. The results showed that the surface area, the presence of macro and mesopores, and the functional groups influence the adsorption of metals on the surface of PET microplastic. The adsorption isotherms confirmed the presence of mesoporosity and macroporosity on the PET microplastic surface. The Freundlich and Langmuir models were used to study the adsorption capacity. The kinetics of adsorptions were interpreted using pseudo-first order and pseudo-second order models. The results indicated that the Langmuir isotherm and the pseudo-second order adequately described the adsorption of metals by the PET microplastic. The removal rates by the PET microplastic varied from 8 to 34% for Ni, 5 to 40% for Cu and 7 to 27% for Co after a period of 5 days. Furthermore, the adsorption was predominantly chemical and extremely fast, indicating that the presence of microplastics in the environment can lead to a rapid metal accumulation which elevates the hazards potential of microplastic in living beings.

ABSTRACT:
PET imaging allows the study of enzyme concentration and activityin vivo. The enzyme natural turnoverα, relevant for drug development, can be estimated if a suicide inhibitor drug is used. The main aim of this study was to develop a model for estimatingαby accounting for the presence of residual inhibitor. We analyzed nonhuman primate PET data with monoacyglycerol lipase (MAGL) tracer [11C]PF-06809247, and suicide inhibitor PF-06818883 (0.03-1.27 mg/kg, active compound PF-06807893). As [11C]PF-06809247 is an irreversible tracer, we used simulations to evaluate the impact of flow limitation on identifiability of kinetic parameters. Based on this, MAGL activity estimates were obtained from three outcome parameters:Ki,k3,(=). A new model, which links enzyme activity to the inhibitor drug's plasma concentration, was used to estimateα. Using a conservative statistical cut-off, MAGL turnover half-lives were estimated (Ki: 3.9 h;k3: 4.6 h;: 6.1 h) - with faster turnover forKi(flow-limited). Serial PET experiments and measuring the drug's plasma concentration allowed to estimateαcorrecting for residual suicide inhibition. This approach can be extended to other PET enzyme targets, improving our understanding of enzyme pathological alterations and suicide inhibitor-based therapies.

ABSTRACT:
Positron emission tomography (PET) targeting translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO) can be used for the noninvasive detection of neuroinflammation. Improved in vivo stability of a TSPO tracer is beneficial for minimizing the potential confounding effects of radiometabolites. Deuteration represents an important strategy for improving the pharmacokinetics and stability of existing drug molecules in the plasma. This study developed a novel tracer via the deuteration of [18F]LW223 and evaluated its in vivo stability and specific binding in neuroinflammatory rodent models and nonhuman primate (NHP) brains. Compared with LW223, D2-LW223 exhibited improved binding affinity to TSPO. Compared with [18F]LW223, [18F]D2-LW223 has superior physicochemical properties and favorable brain kinetics, with enhanced metabolic stability and reduced defluorination. Preclinical investigations in rodent models of LPS-induced neuroinflammation and cerebral ischemia revealed specific [18F]D2-LW223 binding to TSPO in regions affected by neuroinflammation. Two-tissue compartment model analyses provided excellent model fits and allowed the quantitative mapping of TSPO across the NHP brain. These results indicate that [18F]D2-LW223 holds significant promise for the precise quantification of TSPO expression in neuroinflammatory pathologies of the brain.

TITLE: Source-to-Target Automatic Rotating Estimation (STARE) - A publicly-available, blood-free quantification approach for PET tracers with irreversible kinetics: Theoretical framework and validation for [18F]FDG

AUTHORS: Elizabeth A Bartlett, R Todd Ogden, J John Mann, Francesca Zanderigo

JOURNAL: NeuroImage

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Introduction: Full quantification of positron emission tomography (PET) data requires an input function. This generally means arterial blood sampling, which is invasive, labor-intensive and burdensome. There is no current, standardized method to fully quantify PET radiotracers with irreversible kinetics in the absence of blood data. Here, we present Source-to-Target Automatic Rotating Estimation (STARE), a novel, data-driven approach to quantify the net influx rate (Ki) of irreversible PET radiotracers, that requires only individual-level PET data and no blood data. We validate STARE with human [18F]FDG PET scans and assess its performance using simulations.

Methods: STARE builds upon a source-to-target tissue model, where the tracer time activity curves (TACs) in multiple "target" regions are expressed at once as a function of a "source" region, based on the two-tissue irreversible compartment model, and separates target region Kifrom source Kiby fitting the source-to-target model across all target regions simultaneously. To ensure identifiability, data-driven, subject-specific anchoring is used in the STARE minimization, which takes advantage of the PET signal in a vasculature cluster in the field of view (FOV) that is automatically extracted and partial volume-corrected. To avoid the need for any a priori determination of a single source region, each of the considered regions acts in turn as the source, and a final Kiis estimated in each region by averaging the estimates obtained in each source rotation.

Results: In a large dataset of human [18F]FDG scans (N = 69), STARE Kiestimates were correlated with corresponding arterial blood-based Kiestimates (r = 0.80), with an overall regression slope of 0.88, and were precisely estimated, as assessed by comparing STARE Kiestimates across several runs of the algorithm (coefficient of variation across runs=6.74 ± 2.48%). In simulations, STARE Kiestimates were largely robust to factors that influence the individualized anchoring used within its algorithm.

Conclusion: Through simulations and application to [18F]FDG PET data, feasibility is demonstrated for STARE blood-free, data-driven quantification of Ki. Future work will include applying STARE to PET data obtained with a portable PET camera and to other irreversible radiotracers.

TITLE: Four decades of mapping and quantifying neuroreceptors at work in vivo by positron emission tomography

AUTHORS: Albert Gjedde, Dean F Wong

JOURNAL: Frontiers in neuroscience

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Decryption of brain images is the basis for the necessary translation of the findings from imaging to information required to meet the demands of clinical intervention. Tools of brain imaging, therefore, must satisfy the conditions dictated by the needs for interpretation in terms of diagnosis and prognosis. In addition, the applications must serve as fundamental research tools that enable the understanding of new therapeutic drugs, including compounds as diverse as antipsychotics, antidepressants, anxiolytics, and drugs serving the relief of symptoms from neurochemical disorders as unrelated as multiple sclerosis, stroke, and dementia. Here we review and explain the kinetics of methods that enable researchers to describe the brain's work and functions. We focus on methods invented by neurokineticists and expanded upon by practitioners during decades of experimental work and on the methods that are particularly useful to predict possible future approaches to the treatment of neurochemical disorders. We provide an overall description of the basic elements of kinetics and the underlying quantification methods, as well as the mathematics of modeling the recorded brain dynamics embedded in the images we obtainin vivo. The complex presentation to follow is necessary to justify the contribution of modeling to the development of methods and to support the specifications dictated by the proposed use in clinical settings. The quantification and kinetic modeling processes are equally essential to image reconstruction and labeling of brain regions of structural or functional interest. The procedures presented here are essential tools of scientific approaches to all conventional and novel forms of brain imaging. The foundations of the kinetic and quantitative methods are keys to the satisfaction of clinicians that actively engage in treating the neurochemical disorders of mammalian brains in the fields of neurology, neurosurgery, and neuropsychiatry.

ABSTRACT:
Background: In rodents, 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1 (11β-HSD1) catalyzes the conversion of inactive 11-dehydrocorticosterone to the active hormone corticosterone. Dysregulation of intracellular glucocorticoid action is implicated in metabolic diseases. Assessing 11β-HSD1 enzyme levelsin vivomay be key to understanding obesity pathophysiology.

Objective: We used a Zucker Fatty (ZF) rat model and [18F]AS2471907 PET imaging to determine appropriate kinetic modeling methods and assess changes in 11β-HSD1 levels due to obesity in the liver, white and brown adipose tissue (WAT/BAT), and brain.

Material and methods: To validate [18F]AS2471907 PET in preclinical models, time-activity curves (TACs) were generated and kinetic modeling was performed with image-derived input functions (IDIFs) extracted from multiple locations. Quantitative estimates of radioligand binding were compared withex vivo11β-HSD1 protein expression. Validated quantitative PET kinetic modeling methods were then used to assess differences in 11β-HSD1 between lean and obese ZF rats. Metabolic disease status was confirmed with stable isotopes tracer studies of glucose and fatty acid metabolism.

Results: Obesity is associated with decreased brain 11β-HSD1 levels, measured by [18F]AS2471907 PET, which correlated with measures of glucose and fatty acid metabolism.

Conclusion: We demonstrate that [18F]AS2471907 PET can provide useful quantification of 11β-HSD1 levels in a rodent model of obesity.

TITLE: In Vivo Quantitative Whole-Body Perfusion Imaging Using Radiolabeled Copper(II) Bis(Thiosemicarbazone) Complexes and Positron Emission Tomography (PET)

AUTHORS: Mark A Green, Carla J Mathias, Nathaniel J Smith, Monica Cheng, Gary D Hutchins

JOURNAL: Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Traditional quantitative perfusion imaging methods require complex data acquisition and analysis strategies; typically require ancillary arterial blood sampling for measurement of input functions; are limited to single organ or tissue regions in an imaging session; and because of their complexity, are not well suited for routine clinical implementation in a standardized fashion that can be readily repeated across diverse clinical sites. The whole-body perfusion method described in this chapter has the advantages of on-demand radiotracer production; simple tissue pharmacokinetics enabling standardized estimation of perfusion; short-lived radionuclides, facilitating repeat or combination imaging procedures; and scalability to support widespread clinical implementation. This method leverages the unique physiological characteristics of radiolabeled copper(II) bis(thiosemicarbazone) complexes and the detection sensitivity of positron emission tomography (PET) to produce quantitatively accurate whole-body perfusion images. This chapter describes the synthesis of ethylglyoxal bis(thosemicarbazonato)copper(II) labeled with copper-62 ([62Cu]Cu-ETS), its unique physiological characteristics, a simple tracer kinetic model for estimation of perfusion using image-derived input functions, and validation of the method against a reference standard perfusion tracer. A detailed description of the methods is provided to facilitate implementation of the perfusion imaging method in PET imaging facilities.

TITLE: Composite attenuation correction method using a 68Ge-transmission multi-atlas for quantitative brain PET/MR

ABSTRACT:
In positron emission tomography (PET),68Ge-transmission scanning is considered the gold standard in attenuation correction (AC) though not available in current dual imaging systems. In this experimental study we evaluated a novel AC method for PET/magnetic resonance (MR) imaging which is essentially based on a composite database of multiple68Ge-transmission maps and T1-weighted (T1w) MR image-pairs (composite transmission, CTR-AC). This proof-of-concept study used retrospectively a database with 125 pairs of co-registered68Ge-AC maps and T1w MR images from anatomical normal subjects and a validation dataset comprising dynamic [11C]PE2I PET data from nine patients with Parkinsonism. CTR-AC maps were generated by non-rigid image registration of all database T1w MRI to each subject's T1w, applying the same transformation to every68Ge-AC map, and averaging the resulting68Ge-AC maps. [11C]PE2I PET images were reconstructed using CTR-AC and a patient-specific68Ge-AC map as the reference standard. Standardized uptake values (SUV) and quantitative parameters of kinetic analysis were compared, i.e., relative delivery (R1) and non-displaceable binding potential (BPND). CTR-AC showed high accuracy for whole-brain SUV (mean %bias ± SD: 0.5 ± 3.5%), whole-brain R1(-0.1 ± 3.2%), and putamen BPND(3.7 ± 8.1%). SUV and R1precision (SD of %bias) were modest and lowest in the anterior cortex, with an R1%bias of -1.1 ± 6.4%). The prototype CTR-AC is capable of providing accurate MRAC-maps with continuous linear attenuation coefficients though still experimental. The method's accuracy is comparable to the best MRAC methods published so far, both in SUV and as found for ZTE-AC in quantitative parameters of kinetic modelling.

ABSTRACT:
Background: MRI alone has limited accuracy for delineating tumor margins and poorly predicts the aggressiveness of gliomas, especially when tumors do not enhance. This study evaluated simultaneous 3,4-dihydroxy-6-[18F]fluoro-L-phenylalanine (FDOPA)-PET/MRI to define tumor volumes compared to MRI alone more accurately, assessed its role in patient management, and correlated PET findings with histopathology.

Methods: Ten patients with known or suspected gliomas underwent standard of care surgical resection and/or stereotactic biopsy. FDOPA-PET/MRI was performed prior to surgery, allowing for precise co-registration of PET, MR, and biopsies. The biopsy sites were modeled as 5-mm spheres, and the local FDOPA uptake at each site was determined. Correlations were performed between measures of tumor histopathology, and static and dynamic PET values: standardized uptake values (SUVs), tumor to brain ratios, metabolic tumor volumes, and tracer kinetics at volumes of interest (VOIs) and biopsy sites.

Results: Tumor FDOPA-PET uptake was visualized in 8 patients. In 2 patients, tracer uptake was similar to normal brain reference with no histological findings of malignancy. Eight biopsy sites confirmed for glioma had FDOPA uptake without T1 contrast enhancement. The PET parameters were highly correlated only with the cell proliferation marker, Ki-67 (SUVmax: r = 0.985,P= .002). In this study, no statistically significant difference between high-grade and low-grade tumors was demonstrated. The dynamic PET analysis of VOIs and biopsy sites showed decreasing time-activity curves patterns. FDOPA-PET imaging directly influenced patient management.

Conclusions: Simultaneous FDOPA-PET/MRI allowed for more accurate visualization and delineation of gliomas, enabling more appropriate patient management and simplified validation of PET findings with histopathology.

TITLE: Optimization-derived blood input function using a kernel method and its evaluation with total-body PET for brain parametric imaging

AUTHORS: Yansong Zhu, Quyen Tran, Yiran Wang, Ramsey D Badawi, Simon R Cherry, Jinyi Qi, Shiva Abbaszadeh, Guobao Wang

JOURNAL: NeuroImage

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Dynamic PET allows quantification of physiological parameters through tracer kinetic modeling. For dynamic imaging of brain or head and neck cancer on conventional PET scanners with a short axial field of view, the image-derived input function (ID-IF) from intracranial blood vessels such as the carotid artery (CA) suffers from severe partial volume effects. Alternatively, optimization-derived input function (OD-IF) by the simultaneous estimation (SIME) method does not rely on an ID-IF but derives the input function directly from the data. However, the optimization problem is often highly ill-posed. We proposed a new method that combines the ideas of OD-IF and ID-IF together through a kernel framework. While evaluation of such a method is challenging in human subjects, we used the uEXPLORER total-body PET system that covers major blood pools to provide a reference for validation.

Methods: The conventional SIME approach estimates an input function using a joint estimation together with kinetic parameters by fitting time activity curves from multiple regions of interests (ROIs). The input function is commonly parameterized with a highly nonlinear model which is difficult to estimate. The proposed kernel SIME method exploits the CA ID-IF as a priori information via a kernel representation to stabilize the SIME approach. The unknown parameters are linear and thus easier to estimate. The proposed method was evaluated using18F-fluorodeoxyglucose studies with both computer simulations and 20 human-subject scans acquired on the uEXPLORER scanner. The effect of the number of ROIs on kernel SIME was also explored.

Results: The estimated OD-IF by kernel SIME showed a good match with the reference input function and provided more accurate estimation of kinetic parameters for both simulation and human-subject data. The kernel SIME led to the highest correlation coefficient (R = 0.97) and the lowest mean absolute error (MAE = 10.5 %) compared to using the CA ID-IF (R = 0.86, MAE = 108.2 %) and conventional SIME (R = 0.57, MAE = 78.7 %) in the human-subject evaluation. Adding more ROIs improved the overall performance of the kernel SIME method.

Conclusion: The proposed kernel SIME method shows promise to provide an accurate estimation of the blood input function and kinetic parameters for brain PET parametric imaging.

TITLE: Evaluation of [11C]UCB-A positron emission tomography in human brains

AUTHORS: Mengfei Xiong, Mark Lubberink, Lieuwe Appel, Xiaotian Tsong Fang, Torsten Danfors, Eva Kumlien, Gunnar Antoni

JOURNAL: EJNMMI research

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Background: In preclinical studies, the positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with [11C]UCB-A provided promising results for imaging synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A) as a proxy for synaptic density. This paper reports the first-in-human [11C]UCB-A PET study to characterise its kinetics in healthy subjects and further evaluate SV2A-specific binding.

Results: Twelve healthy subjects underwent 90-min baseline [11C]UCB-A scans with PET/MRI, with two subjects participating in an additional blocking scan with the same scanning procedure after a single dose of levetiracetam (1500 mg). Our results indicated abundant [11C]UCB-A brain uptake across all cortical regions, with slow elimination. Kinetic modelling of [11C]UCB-A PET using various compartment models suggested that the irreversible two-tissue compartment model best describes the kinetics of the radioactive tracer. Accordingly, the Patlak graphical analysis was used to simplify the analysis. The estimated SV2A occupancy determined by the Lassen plot was around 66%. Significant specific binding at baseline and comparable binding reduction as grey matter precludes the use of centrum semiovale as reference tissue.

Conclusions: [11C]UCB-A PET imaging enables quantifying SV2A in vivo. However, its slow kinetics require a long scan duration, which is impractical with the short half-life of carbon-11. Consequently, the slow kinetics and complicated quantification methods may restrict its use in humans.

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Integrins αvare key molecules in the pathogenesis of fibrosis in multiple organs. To assess the potential utility of integrin αvβ3imaging for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), we evaluated an18F-FPP-RGD2PET probe in a rat model of bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis.

Methods: Pulmonary fibrosis was induced by single intratracheal instillation of bleomycin (3 mg/rat). Positron emission tomography (PET)/computerized tomography scans were performed 4 weeks after bleomycin administration using18F-FPP-RGD2. Total distribution volume (VT) was estimated using one-tissue/two-compartment, two-tissue/three-compartment models, and Logan graphical analysis (Logan plot; t* = 30 min). Plasma-free fractions were estimated from images of the left ventricle. Correlation between Logan VTand lung pathology was assessed by Spearman's rank correlation.

Results: Histopathological evaluation demonstrated the development of fibrosis in IPF-model group. Integrin αvprotein expression and lung radioactivity were higher in IPF-model group compared with control group. The lung radioactivity of18F-FPP-RGD2rapidly reached the peak after administration and then gradually decreased, whereas left ventricular radioactivity rapidly disappeared. Logan graphical analysis was found to be suitable for18F-FPP-RGD2kinetic analysis in the IPF-model lung. Logan VTvalues for18F-FPP-RGD2were significantly higher in IPF rats compared with control rats and strongly correlated with lung fibrosis, pathology, integrin αvprotein expression, and oxygen partial pressure.

Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that the integrin αvβ3PET probe18F-FPP-RGD2can detect pathophysiological changes in lungs, including fibrosis accompanying upregulated integrin αvof IPF-model rats. These findings support the utility of18F-FPP-RGD2PET imaging for the pathophysiological evaluation of pulmonary fibrosis.

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: The fibroblast activation protein (FAP) is an emerging target for molecular imaging and therapy in cancer. OncoFAP is a novel small organic ligand for FAP with very high affinity. In this translational study, we establish [68Ga]Ga-OncoFAP-DOTAGA (68Ga-OncoFAP) radiolabeling, benchmark its properties in preclinical imaging, and evaluate its application in clinical PET scanning.

Methods: 68Ga-OncoFAP was synthesized in a cassette-based fully automated labeling module. Lipophilicity, affinity, and serum stability of68Ga-OncoFAP were assessed by determining logD7.4, IC50values, and radiochemical purity.68Ga-OncoFAP tumor uptake and imaging properties were assessed in preclinical dynamic PET/MRI in murine subcutaneous tumor models. Finally, biodistribution and uptake in a variety of tumor types were analyzed in 12 patients based on individual clinical indications that received 163 ± 50 MBq68Ga-OncoFAP combined with PET/CT and PET/MRI.

Results: 68Ga-OncoFAP radiosynthesis was accomplished with high radiochemical yields. Affinity for FAP, lipophilicity, and stability of68Ga-OncoFAP measured are ideally suited for PET imaging. PET and gamma counting-based biodistribution demonstrated beneficial tracer kinetics and high uptake in murine FAP-expressing tumor models with high tumor-to-blood ratios of 8.6 ± 5.1 at 1 h and 38.1 ± 33.1 at 3 h p.i. Clinical68Ga-OncoFAP-PET/CT and PET/MRI demonstrated favorable biodistribution and kinetics with high and reliable uptake in primary cancers (SUVmax12.3 ± 2.3), lymph nodes (SUVmax9.7 ± 8.3), and distant metastases (SUVmaxup to 20.0).

Conclusion: Favorable radiochemical properties, rapid clearance from organs and soft tissues, and intense tumor uptake validate68Ga-OncoFAP as a powerful alternative to currently available FAP tracers.

TITLE: PET imaging of neurotransmission using direct parametric reconstruction

JOURNAL: NeuroImage

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Receptor ligand-based dynamic Positron Emission Tomography (PET) permits the measurement of neurotransmitter release in the human brain. For single-scan paradigms, the conventional method of estimating changes in neurotransmitter levels relies on fitting a pharmacokinetic model to activity concentration histories extracted after PET image reconstruction. However, due to the statistical fluctuations of activity concentration data at the voxel scale, parametric images computed using this approach often exhibit low signal-to-noise ratio, impeding characterization of neurotransmitter release. Numerous studies have shown that direct parametric reconstruction (DPR) approaches, which combine image reconstruction and kinetic analysis in a unified framework, can improve the signal-to-noise ratio of parametric mapping. However, there is little experience with DPR in imaging of neurotransmission and the performance of the approach in this application has not been evaluated before in humans. In this report, we present and evaluate a DPR methodology that computes 3-D distributions of ligand transport, binding potential (BPND) and neurotransmitter release magnitude (γ) from a dynamic sequence of PET sinograms. The technique employs the linear simplified reference region model (LSRRM) of Alpert et al. (2003), which represents an extension of the simplified reference region model that incorporates time-varying binding parameters due to radioligand displacement by release of neurotransmitter. Estimation of parametric images is performed by gradient-based optimization of a Poisson log-likelihood function incorporating LSRRM kinetics and accounting for the effects of head movement, attenuation, detector sensitivity, random and scattered coincidences. A11C-raclopride simulation study showed that the proposed approach substantially reduces the bias and variance of voxel-wise γ estimates as compared to standard methods. Moreover, simulations showed that detection of release could be made more reliable and/or conducted using a smaller sample size using the proposed DPR estimator. Likewise, images of BPNDcomputed using DPR had substantially improved bias and variance properties. Application of the method in human subjects was demonstrated using11C-raclopride dynamic scans and a reward task, confirming the improved quality of the estimated parametric images using the proposed approach.

ABSTRACT:
[11C]UCB-J is a novel radioligand that binds to synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A). The main objective of this study was to determine the 28-day test-retest repeatability (TRT) of quantitative [11C]UCB-J brain positron emission tomography (PET) imaging in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and healthy controls (HCs). Nine HCs and eight AD patients underwent two 60 min dynamic [11C]UCB-J PET scans with arterial sampling with an interval of 28 days. The optimal tracer kinetic model was assessed using the Akaike criteria (AIC). Micro-/macro-parameters such as tracer delivery (K1) and volume of distribution (VT) were estimated using the optimal model. Data were also analysed for simplified reference tissue model (SRTM) with centrum semi-ovale (white matter) as reference region. Based on AIC, both 1T2k_VBand 2T4k_VBdescribed the [11C]UCB-J kinetics equally well. Analysis showed that whole-brain grey matter TRT for VT, DVR and SRTM BPNDwere -2.2% ± 8.5, 0.4% ± 12.0 and -8.0% ± 10.2, averaged over all subjects. [11C]UCB-J kinetics can be well described by a 1T2k_VBmodel, and a 60 min scan duration was sufficient to obtain reliable estimates for both plasma input and reference tissue models. TRT for VT, DVR and BPNDwas <15% (1SD) averaged over all subjects and indicates adequate quantitative repeatability of [11C]UCB-J PET.

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: [11C]Metomidate positron emission tomography (PET) is currently used for staging of adrenocortical carcinoma and for lateralization in primary aldosteronism (PA). Due to the short half-life of carbon-11 and a high non-specific liver uptake of [11C]metomidate there is a need for improved adrenal imaging methods. In a previous pre-clinical study para-chloro-2-[18F]fluoroethyletomidate has been proven to be a specific adrenal tracer. The objective is to perform a first evaluation of para-chloro-2-[18F]fluoroethyletomidate positron emission computed tomography ([18F]CETO-PET/CT) in patients with adrenal tumours and healthy volunteers.

Methods: Fifteen patients underwent [18F]CETO-PET/CT. Five healthy volunteers were recruited for test-retest analysis and three out of the five underwent additional [15O]water PET/CT to measure adrenal blood flow. Arterial blood sampling and tracer metabolite analysis was performed. The kinetics of [18F]CETO were assessed and simplified quantitative methods were validated by comparison to outcome measures of tracer kinetic analysis.

Results: Uptake of [18F]CETO was low in the liver and high in adrenals. Initial metabolization was rapid, followed by a plateau. The kinetics of [18F]CETO in healthy adrenals and all adrenal pathologies, except for adrenocortical carcinoma, were best described by an irreversible single-tissue compartment model. Standardized uptake values (SUV) correlated well with the uptake rate constant K1. Both K1and SUV were highly correlated to adrenal blood flow in healthy controls. Repeatability coefficients of K1, SUV65-70, and SUV120were 25, 22, and 17%.

Conclusions: High adrenal uptake combined with a low unspecific liver uptake suggests that18F]CETO is a suitable tracer for adrenal imaging. Adrenal SUV, based on a whole-body scan at 1 h p.i., correlated well with the net uptake rate Ki.

JOURNAL: Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
A wide range of buprenorphine doses are used for either pain management or maintenance therapy in opioid addiction. The complex in vitro profile of buprenorphine, with affinity for µ-, δ-, and κ-opioid receptors (OR), makes it difficult to predict its dose-related neuropharmacology in vivo. In rats, microPET imaging and pretreatment by OR antagonists were performed to assess the binding of radiolabeled buprenorphine (microdose11C-buprenorphine) to OR subtypes in vivo (n = 4 per condition). The µ-selective antagonist naloxonazine (10 mg/kg) and the non-selective OR antagonist naloxone (1 mg/kg) blocked the binding of11C-buprenorphine, while pretreatment by the δ-selective (naltrindole, 3 mg/kg) or the κ-selective antagonist (norbinaltorphimine, 10 mg/kg) did not. In four macaques, PET imaging and kinetic modeling enabled description of the regional brain kinetics of11C-buprenorphine, co-injected with increasing doses of unlabeled buprenorphine. No saturation of the brain penetration of buprenorphine was observed for doses up to 0.11 mg/kg. Regional differences in buprenorphine-associated receptor occupancy were observed. Analgesic doses of buprenorphine (0.003 and 0.006 mg/kg), respectively, occupied 20% and 49% of receptors in the thalamus while saturating the low but significant binding observed in cerebellum and occipital cortex. Occupancy >90% was achieved in most brain regions with plasma concentrations >7 µg/L. PET data obtained after co-injection of an analgesic dose of buprenorphine (0.003 mg/kg) predicted the binding potential of microdose11C-buprenorphine. This strategy could be further combined with pharmacodynamic exploration or pharmacological MRI to investigate the neuropharmacokinetics and neuroreceptor correlate, at least at µ-OR, of the acute effects of buprenorphine in humans.

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) is an enzyme with putative effect on neuroinflammation through its influence on the homeostasis of polyunsaturated fatty acids and related byproducts. sEH is an enzyme that metabolizes anti-inflammatory epoxy fatty acids to the corresponding, relatively inert 1,2-diols. A high availability or activity of sEH promotes vasoconstriction and inflammation in local tissues that may be linked to neuropsychiatric diseases. We developed [18F]FNDP to study sEH in vivo with positron emission tomography (PET).

Methods: Brain PET using bolus injection of [18F]FNDP followed by emission imaging lasting 90 or 180 min was completed in healthy adults (5 males, 2 females, ages 40-53 years). The kinetic behavior of [18F]FNDP was evaluated using a radiometabolite-corrected arterial plasma input function with compartmental or graphical modeling approaches.

Results: [18F]FNDP PET was without adverse effects. Akaike information criterion favored the two-tissue compartment model (2TCM) in all ten regions of interest. Regional total distribution volume (VT) values from each compartmental model and Logan analysis were generally well identified except for corpus callosum VTusing the 2TCM. Logan analysis was assessed as the choice model due to stability of regional VTvalues from 90-min data and due to high correlation of Logan-derived regional VTvalues with those from the 2TCM. [18F]FNDP binding was higher in human cerebellar cortex and thalamus relative to supratentorial cortical regions, which aligns with reported expression patterns of the epoxide hydrolase 2 gene in human brain.

Conclusion: These data support further use of [18F]FNDP PET to study sEH in human brain.

ABSTRACT:
[18F]MC225 has been developed as a weak substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) aimed to measure changes in the P-gp function at the blood-brain barrier with positron emission tomography. This study evaluates [18F]MC225 kinetics in non-human primates and investigates the effect of both scan duration and P-gp inhibition. Three rhesus monkeys underwent two 91-min dynamic scans with blood sampling at baseline and after P-gp inhibition (8 mg/kg tariquidar). Data were analyzed using the 1-tissue compartment model (1-TCM) and 2-tissue compartment model (2-TCM) fits using metabolite-corrected plasma as the input function and for various scan durations (10, 20, 30, 60, and 91 min). The preferred model was chosen according to the Akaike information criterion and the standard errors (%) of the estimated parameters. For the 91-min scan duration, the influx constantK1increased by 40.7% and the volume of distribution (VT) by 30.4% after P-gp inhibition, while the efflux constantk2did not change significantly. Similar changes were found for all evaluated scan durations.K1did not depend on scan duration (10 min-K1= 0.2191 vs 91 min-K1= 0.2258), whileVTandk2did. A scan duration of 10 min seems sufficient to properly evaluate the P-gp function usingK1obtained with 1-TCM. For the 91-min scan,VTandK1can be estimated with a 2-TCM, and both parameters can be used to assess P-gp function.

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: To investigate the kinetic metrics of 2-[18F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (18F-FDG) in normal organs by using dynamic total-body (TB) positron emission tomography (PET).

Methods: Dynamic TB-PET was performed for nine healthy volunteers. Time-to-activity curves (TACs) were obtained by drawing regions of interest in the organs. A two-tissue compartment model was fitted for each tissue TAC. Constant rates, including k1, k2, and k3, and the metabolic rate of FDG (MRFDG) were obtained. The parameter statistics, including the average, standard deviation, coefficient of variance, and inter-site and inter-individual variances, were compared.

Results: Constant rates and MRFDG varied significantly among organs and subjects, but not among sides or sub-regions within an organ. The mean k1and k2ranged from 0.0158 min-1in the right lower lung to 1.1883 min-1in the anterior wall of the left ventricle (LV) myocardium and from 0.1116 min-1in the left parietal white matter to 4.6272 min-1in the left thyroid, respectively. The k3was lowest in the right upper area of the liver and highest in the septal wall of the LV myocardium. Mean MRFDG ranged from 23.1696 μmol/100 g/min in the parietal cortex to 0.5945 μmol/100 g/min in the lung. Four groups of organs with similar kinetic characteristics were identified: (1) the cerebral white matter, lung, liver, muscle, bone, and bone marrow; (2) cerebral and cerebellar cortex; (3) LV myocardium and thyroid; and (4) pancreas, spleen, and kidney.

Conclusion: The kinetic rates and MRFDG significantly differed among organs. The kinetic metrics of FDG parameters in normal organs can serve as a reference for future dynamic PET imaging and research.

ABSTRACT:
The PET ligand11C-PBR28 (N-((2-(methoxy-11C)-phenyl)methyl)-N-(6-phenoxy-3-pyridinyl)acetamide) binds to the 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO), a biomarker of glia. In clinical studies of TSPO, the ligand total distribution volume, VT, is frequently the reported outcome measure. Since VTis the sum of the ligand-specific distribution volume (VS) and the nondisplaceable-binding distribution volume (VND), differences in VNDacross subjects and groups will have an impact on VTMethods:Here, we used a recently developed method for simultaneous estimation of VND(SIME) to disentangle contributions from VNDand VSData from 4 previously published11C-PBR28 PET studies were included: before and after a lipopolysaccharide challenge (8 subjects), in alcohol use disorder (14 patients, 15 controls), in first-episode psychosis (16 patients, 16 controls), and in Parkinson disease (16 patients, 16 controls). In each dataset, regional VTestimates were obtained with a standard 2-tissue-compartment model, and brain-wide VNDwas estimated with SIME. VSwas then calculated as VT- VNDVNDand VSwere then compared across groups, within each dataset.Results:A lower VNDwas found for individuals with alcohol-use disorder (34%,P= 0.00084) and Parkinson disease (34%,P= 0.0032) than in their corresponding controls. We found no difference in VNDbetween first-episode psychosis patients and their controls, and the administration of lipopolysaccharide did not change VNDConclusion:Our findings suggest that in TSPO PET studies, nondisplaceable binding can differ between patient groups and conditions and should therefore be considered.

TITLE: Solar Water Disinfection to Produce Safe Drinking Water: A Review of Parameters, Enhancements, and Modelling Approaches to Make SODIS Faster and Safer

AUTHORS: Ángela García-Gil, Rafael A García-Muñoz, Kevin G McGuigan, Javier Marugán

JOURNAL: Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Solar water disinfection (SODIS) is one the cheapest and most suitable treatments to produce safe drinking water at the household level in resource-poor settings. This review introduces the main parameters that influence the SODIS process and how new enhancements and modelling approaches can overcome some of the current drawbacks that limit its widespread adoption. Increasing the container volume can decrease the recontamination risk caused by handling several 2 L bottles. Using container materials other than polyethylene terephthalate (PET) significantly increases the efficiency of inactivation of viruses and protozoa. In addition, an overestimation of the solar exposure time is usually recommended since the process success is often influenced by many factors beyond the control of the SODIS-user. The development of accurate kinetic models is crucial for ensuring the production of safe drinking water. This work attempts to review the relevant knowledge about the impact of the SODIS variables and the techniques used to develop kinetic models described in the literature. In addition to the type and concentration of pathogens in the untreated water, an ideal kinetic model should consider all critical factors affecting the efficiency of the process, such as intensity, spectral distribution of the solar radiation, container-wall transmission spectra, ageing of the SODIS reactor material, and chemical composition of the water, since the substances in the water can play a critical role as radiation attenuators and/or sensitisers triggering the inactivation process.

TITLE: Quantification of [18F]afatinib using PET/CT in NSCLC patients: a feasibility study

AUTHORS: E A van de Stadt, M Yaqub, A A Lammertsma, A J Poot, P R Schober, R C Schuit, E F Smit, I Bahce, N H Hendrikse

JOURNAL: EJNMMI research

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Introduction: Only a subgroup of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients benefit from treatment using epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) such as afatinib. Tumour uptake of [18F]afatinib using positron emission tomography (PET) may identify those patients that respond to afatinib therapy. Therefore, the aim of this study was to find the optimal tracer kinetic model for quantification of [18F]afatinib uptake in NSCLC tumours.

Methods: [18F]Afatinib PET scans were performed in 10 NSCLC patients. The first patient was scanned for the purpose of dosimetry. Subsequent patients underwent a 20-min dynamic [15O]H2O PET scan (370 MBq) followed by a dynamic [18F]afatinib PET scan (342 ± 24 MBq) of 60 or 90 min. Using the Akaike information criterion (AIC), three pharmacokinetic plasma input models were evaluated with both metabolite-corrected sampler-based input and image-derived (IDIF) input functions in combination with discrete blood samples. Correlation analysis of arterial on-line sampling versus IDIF was performed. In addition, perfusion dependency and simplified measures were assessed.

Results: Ten patients were included. The injected activity of [18F]afatinib was 341 ± 37 MBq. Fifteen tumours could be identified in the field of view of the scanner. Based on AIC, tumour kinetics were best described using an irreversible two-tissue compartment model and a metabolite-corrected sampler-based input function (Akaike 50%). Correlation of plasma-based input functions with metabolite-corrected IDIF was very strong (r2= 0.93). The preferred simplified uptake parameter was the tumour-to-blood ratio over the 60- to 90-min time interval (TBR60-90). Tumour uptake of [18F]afatinib was independent of perfusion.

Conclusion: The preferred pharmacokinetic model for quantifying [18F]afatinib uptake in NSCLC tumours was the 2T3K_vb model. TBR60-90showed excellent correlation with this model and is the best candidate simplified method.

TITLE: [68Ga]Ga-iPSMA-Lys3-Bombesin: Biokinetics, dosimetry and first patient PET/CT imaging

AUTHORS: Belén Rivera-Bravo, Gerardo Ramírez-Nava, Mónica J Mendoza-Figueroa, Blanca Ocampo-García, Guillermina Ferro-Flores, Miguel A Ávila-Rodríguez, Clara Santos-Cuevas

JOURNAL: Nuclear medicine and biology

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Background: The prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) and the gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR) are overexpressed in prostate cancer (PCa). In preclinical studies, the iPSMA-Lys3-Bombesin (iPSMA-BN) heterodimeric ligand has shown a suitable affinity for PSMA and GRPR. This research aimed to assess the biokinetics and radiation dosimetry of [68Ga]Ga-iPSMA-BN in four healthy volunteers based on biodistribution data obtained from whole-body PET/CT studies, as well as to visualize the [68Ga]Ga-iPSMA-BN tumor uptake in a patient with PCa.

Methods: PET/CT images acquired at 5 min, 0.5, 1, and 2 h after radiotracer administration (124.5 ± 2.1 MBq) were corrected for attenuation, scattering, dead-time, and decay. The activity in the segmented volumes of interest (VOIs) in each source organ at different times was adjusted to mono- and bi-exponential biokinetic models (A(t)VOI), from which the total disintegrations (N) were calculated to assess the internal radiation doses by using the OLINDA V1.1 code.

Results: Images from the patient showed an evident uptake by the metastasis (SUVmax of 4.7) and by the organs expressing GRPR (pancreas) and PSMA (salivary glands). The average effective dose was 2.70 ± 0.05 mSv, which was like those known for most of the68Ga studies, making [68Ga]Ga-iPSMA-BN a promising dual-target PET imaging radiotracer for PCa.

Conclusions: [68Ga]Ga-iPSMA-BN, capable of detecting both PSMA and GRPR with suitable biokinetics and dosimetric patterns, could be a potential complementary diagnostic tool for the improvement of prostate cancer PET imaging.

TITLE: Single-voxel delay map from long-axial field-of-view PET scans

AUTHORS: Frederik Bay Nielsen, Ulrich Lindberg, Heloisa N Bordallo, Camilla Bardram Johnbeck, Ian Law, Barbara Malene Fischer, Flemming Littrup Andersen, Thomas Lund Andersen

JOURNAL: Frontiers in nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Objective: We present an algorithm to estimate the delay between a tissue time-activity curve and a blood input curve at a single-voxel level tested on whole-body data from a long-axial field-of-view scanner with tracers of different noise characteristics.

Methods: Whole-body scans of 15 patients divided equally among three tracers, namely [15O]H2O, [18F]FDG and [64Cu]Cu-DOTATATE, which were used in development and testing of the algorithm. Delay times were estimated by fitting the cumulatively summed input function and tissue time-activity curve with special considerations for noise. To evaluate the performance of the algorithm, it was compared against two other algorithms also commonly applied in delay estimation: name cross-correlation and a one-tissue compartment model with incorporated delay. All algorithms were tested on both synthetic time-activity curves produced with the one-tissue compartment model with increasing levels of noise and delays between the tissue activity curve and the blood input curve. Whole-body delay maps were also calculated for each of the three tracers with data acquired on a long-axial field-of-view scanner with high time resolution.

Results: Our proposed model performs better for low signal-to-noise ratio time-activity curves compared to both cross-correlation and the one-tissue compartment models for non-[15O]H2O tracers. Testing on synthetically produced time-activity curves showed only a small and even residual delay, while the one-tissue compartment model with included delay showed varying residual delays.

Conclusion: The algorithm is robust to noise and proves applicable on a range of tracers as tested on [15O]H2O, [18F]FDG and [64Cu]Cu-DOTATATE, and hence is a viable option offering the ability for delay correction across various organs and tracers in use with kinetic modeling.

AUTHORS: Jonathan B Moody, Alexis Poitrasson-Rivière, Tomoe Hagio, Christopher Buckley, Richard L Weinberg, James R Corbett, Venkatesh L Murthy, Edward P Ficaro

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear cardiology : official publication of the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Background: 18F-Flurpiridaz is a promising investigational radiotracer for PET myocardial perfusion imaging with favorable properties for quantification of myocardial blood flow (MBF). We sought to validate the incremental diagnostic value of absolute MBF quantification in a large multicenter trial against quantitative coronary angiography.

Methods: We retrospectively analyzed a subset of patients (N = 231) from the first phase 3 flurpiridaz trial (NCT01347710). Dynamic PET data at rest and pharmacologic stress were fit to a previously validated 2-tissue-compartment model. Absolute MBF and myocardial flow reserve (MFR) were compared with coronary artery disease severity quantified by invasive coronary angiography on a per-patient and per-vessel basis.

Results: Stress MBF per-vessel accurately identified obstructive disease (c-index 0.79) and progressively declined with increasing stenosis severity (2.35 ± 0.71 in patients without CAD; 1.92 ± 0.49 in non-obstructed territories of CAD patients; and 1.54 ± 0.50 in diseased territories, P < 0.05). MFR similarly declined with increasing stenosis severity (3.03 ± 0.94; 2.69 ± 0.95; and 2.33 ± 0.86, respectively, P < 0.05). In multivariable logistic regression modeling, stress MBF and MFR provided incremental diagnostic value beyond patient characteristics and relative perfusion analysis.

Conclusions: Clinical myocardial blood flow measurement with18F-flurpiridaz cardiac PET shows promise for routine application.

ABSTRACT:
A question relevant to nicotine addiction is how nicotine and other nicotinic receptor membrane-permeant ligands, such as the anti-smoking drug varenicline (Chantix), distribute in brain. Ligands, like varenicline, with high pKaand high affinity for α4β2-type nicotinic receptors (α4β2Rs) are trapped in intracellular acidic vesicles containing α4β2Rsin vitroNicotine, with lower pKaand α4β2R affinity, is not trapped. Here, we extend our results by imaging nicotinic PET ligandsin vivoin male and female mouse brain and identifying the trapping brain organellein vitroas Golgi satellites (GSats). Two PET18F-labeled imaging ligands were chosen: [18F]2-FA85380 (2-FA) with varenicline-like pKaand affinity and [18F]Nifene with nicotine-like pKaand affinity. [18F]2-FA PET-imaging kinetics were very slow consistent with 2-FA trapping in α4β2R-containing GSats. In contrast, [18F]Nifene kinetics were rapid, consistent with its binding to α4β2Rs but no trapping. Specific [18F]2-FA and [18F]Nifene signals were eliminated in β2 subunit knock-out (KO) mice or by acute nicotine (AN) injections demonstrating binding to sites on β2-containing receptors. Chloroquine (CQ), which dissipates GSat pH gradients, reduced [18F]2-FA distributions while having little effect on [18F]Nifene distributionsin vivoconsistent with only [18F]2-FA trapping in GSats. These results are further supported byin vitrofindings where dissipation of GSat pH gradients blocks 2-FA trapping in GSats without affecting Nifene. By combiningin vitroandin vivoimaging, we mapped both the brain-wide and subcellular distributions of weak-base nicotinic receptor ligands. We conclude that ligands, such as varenicline, are trapped in neurons in α4β2R-containing GSats, which results in very slow release long after nicotine is gone after smoking.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTMechanisms of nicotine addiction remain poorly understood. An earlier study usingin vitromethods found that the anti-smoking nicotinic ligand, varenicline (Chantix) was trapped in α4β2R-containing acidic vesicles. Using a fluorescent-labeled high-affinity nicotinic ligand, this study provided evidence that these intracellular acidic vesicles were α4β2R-containing Golgi satellites (GSats).In vivoPET imaging with F-18-labeled nicotinic ligands provided additional evidence that differences in PET ligand trapping in acidic vesicles were the cause of differences in PET ligand kinetics and subcellular distributions. These findings combiningin vitroandin vivoimaging revealed new mechanistic insights into the kinetics of weak base PET imaging ligands and the subcellular mechanisms underlying nicotine addiction.

TITLE: Phantom Validation of a Conservation of Activity-Based Partial Volume Correction Method for Arterial Input Function in Dynamic PET Imaging

AUTHORS: Brandon Driscoll, Tina Shek, Douglass Vines, Alex Sun, David Jaffray, Ivan Yeung

JOURNAL: Tomography (Ann Arbor, Mich.)

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Dynamic PET (dPET) imaging can be utilized to perform kinetic modelling of various physiologic processes, which are exploited by the constantly expanding range of targeted radiopharmaceuticals. To date, dPET remains primarily in the research realm due to a number of technical challenges, not least of which is addressing partial volume effects (PVE) in the input function. We propose a series of equations for the correction of PVE in the input function and present the results of a validation study, based on a purpose built phantom.18F-dPET experiments were performed using the phantom on a set of flow tubes representing large arteries, such as the aorta (1" 2.54 cm ID), down to smaller vessels, such as the iliac arteries and veins (1/4" 0.635 cm ID). When applied to the dPET experimental images, the PVE correction equations were able to successfully correct the image-derived input functions by as much as 59 ± 35% in the presence of background, which resulted in image-derived area under the curve (AUC) values within 8 ± 9% of ground truth AUC. The peak heights were similarly well corrected to within 9 ± 10% of the scaled DCE-CT curves. The same equations were then successfully applied to correct patient input functions in the aorta and internal iliac artery/vein. These straightforward algorithms can be applied to dPET images from any PET-CT scanner to restore the input function back to a more clinically representative value, without the need for high-end Time of Flight systems or Point Spread Function correction algorithms.

AUTHORS: Siqi Li, Yasser G Abdelhafez, Lorenzo Nardo, Simon R Cherry, Ramsey D Badawi, Guobao Wang

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
The standard Patlak plot, a simple yet efficient model, is widely used to describe irreversible tracer kinetics for dynamic PET imaging. Its widespread application to whole-body parametric imaging remains constrained because of the need for a full-time-course input function (e.g., 1 h). In this paper, we demonstrate the relative Patlak (RP) plot, which eliminates the need for the early-time input function, for total-body parametric imaging and its application to 20-min clinical scans acquired in list mode.Methods:We conducted a theoretic analysis to indicate that the RP interceptb' is equivalent to a ratio of the SUV relative to the plasma concentration, whereas the RP slope' is equal to the standard Patlak(net influx rate) multiplied by a global scaling factor for each subject. One challenge in applying RP to a short scan duration (e.g., 20 min) is the resulting high noise in the parametric images. We applied a self-supervised deep-kernel method for noise reduction. Using the standard Patlak plot as the reference, the RP method was evaluated for lesion quantification, lesion-to-background contrast, and myocardial visualization in total-body parametric imaging in 22 human subjects (12 healthy subjects and 10 cancer patients) who underwent a 1-h dynamic18F-FDG scan. The RP method was also applied to the dynamic data reconstructed from a clinical standard 20-min list-mode scan either at 1 or 2 h after injection for 2 cancer patients.Results:We demonstrated that it is feasible to obtain high-quality parametric images from 20-min scans using RP parametric imaging with a self-supervised deep-kernel noise-reduction strategy. The RP slope' was highly correlated with the standard Patlakin lesions and major organs, demonstrating its quantitative potential across subjects. Compared with conventional SUVs, the' images significantly improved lesion contrast and enabled visualization of the myocardium for potential cardiac assessment. The application of the RP parametric imaging to the 2 clinical scans also showed similar benefits.Conclusion:Using total-body PET with the RP approach, it is feasible to generate parametric images using data from a 20-min clinical list-mode scan.

ABSTRACT:
Positron emission tomography (PET) neuroimaging provides unique possibilities to study biological processes in vivo under basal and interventional conditions. For quantification of PET data, researchers commonly apply different arrays of sequential data analytic methods ("preprocessing pipeline"), but it is often unknown how the choice of preprocessing affects the final outcome. Here, we use an available data set from a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled [11C]DASB-PET study as a case to evaluate how the choice of preprocessing affects the outcome of the study. We tested the impact of 384 commonly used preprocessing strategies on a previously reported positive association between the change from baseline in neocortical serotonin transporter binding determined with [11C]DASB-PET, and change in depressive symptoms, following a pharmacological sex hormone manipulation intervention in 30 women. The two preprocessing steps that were most critical for the outcome were motion correction and kinetic modeling of the dynamic PET data. We found that 36% of the applied preprocessing strategies replicated the originally reported finding (p< 0.05). For preprocessing strategies with motion correction, the replication percentage was 72%, whereas it was 0% for strategies without motion correction. In conclusion, the choice of preprocessing strategy can have a major impact on a study outcome.

TITLE: Noninvasive quantification of nonhuman primate dynamic 18F-FDG PET imaging

AUTHORS: Xueqi Chen, Sulei Zhang, Jianhua Zhang, Lixin Chen, Rongfu Wang, Yun Zhou

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
18F-FDG uptake rate constant Kiis the main physiology parameter measured in dynamic PET studies. A model-independent graphical analysis using Patlak plot with plasma input function (PIF) is a standard approach used to estimate Ki. The PIF is the18F-FDG time activity curve (TAC) in plasma that is obtained by serial arterial blood sampling. The purpose of the study is to evaluate a Patlak plot-based optimization approach with reduced blood samples for noninvasive quantification of dynamic18F-FDG PET imaging. Eight 60 min rhesus monkey brain dynamic18F-FDG PET scans with arterial blood samples were collected. The measured PIF (mPIF) was determined by arterial blood samples. TACs of seven cerebral regions of interest were generated from each study. With a given number of blood samples, the population-based PIF (pPIF) was determined by either interpolation or extrapolation method using scale calibrated population mean of normalized PIF. The optimal sampling scheme with given blood sample size was determined by maximizing the correlations between the Kiestimated from pPIF and those obtained by mPIF. A leave-two-out cross-validation method was used for evaluation. The linear correlations between the Kiestimates from pPIF with optimal sampling schemes and those from mPIF were: Ki(pPIF 1 sample at 40 min) = 1.015 Ki(mPIF) - 0.000, R2= 0.974; Ki(pPIF 2 samples at 35 and 50 min) = 1.052 Ki(mPIF) - 0.001, R2= 0.976; Ki(pPIF 3 samples at 12, 40, and 50 min) = 1.030 Ki(mPIF) - 0.000, R2= 0.985; and Ki(pPIF 4 samples at 10, 20, 40, and 50 min) = 1.016 Ki(mPIF)- 0.000, R2= 0.993. As the sample size became greater or equal to 4, the Kiestimates from pPIF with the optimal protocol were almost identical to those from mPIF. The Patlak plot-based optimization approach is a reliable method to estimate PIF for noninvasive quantification of non-human primate dynamic18F-FDG PET imaging and is potentially extendable to further translational human studies.

TITLE: Bridging the gap between Kok-type and kinetic models of photosynthetic electron transport within Photosystem II

AUTHORS: Kyle Mani, Apostolos Zournas, G Charles Dismukes

JOURNAL: Photosynthesis research

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Historically, two modeling approaches have been developed independently to describe photosynthetic electron transport (PET) from water to plastoquinone within Photosystem II (PSII): Markov models account for losses from finite redox transition probabilities but predict no reaction kinetics, and ordinary differential equation (ODE) models account for kinetics but not for redox inefficiencies. We have developed an ODE mathematical framework to calculate Markov inefficiencies of transition probabilities as defined in Joliot-Kok-type catalytic cycles. We adapted a previously published ODE model for PET within PSII that accounts for 238 individual steps to enable calculation of the four photochemical inefficiency parameters (miss, double hit, inactivation, backward transition) and the four redox accumulation states (S-states) that are predicted by the most advanced of the Joliot-Kok-type models (VZAD). Using only reaction kinetic parameters without other assumptions, the RODE-calculated time-averaged (e.g., equilibrium) inefficiency parameters and equilibrium S-state populations agree with those calculated by time-independent Joliot-Kok models. RODE also predicts their time-dependent values during transient photochemical steps for all 96 microstates involving PSII redox cofactors. We illustrate applications to two cyanobacteria, Arthrospira maxima and Synechococcus sp. 7002, where experimental data exists for the inefficiency parameters and the S-state populations, and historical data for plant chloroplasts as benchmarks. Significant findings: RODE predicts the microstates responsible for period-4 and period-2 oscillations of O2and fluorescence yields and the four inefficiency parameters; the latter parameters are not constant for each S state nor in time, in contrast to predictions from Joliot-Kok models; some of the recombination pathways that contribute to the backward transition parameter are identified and found to contribute when their rates exceed the oxidation rate of the terminal acceptor pool (PQH2); prior reports based on the assumptions of Joliot-Kok parameters may require reinterpretation.

TITLE: The shelf-life of chestnut rose beverage packaged in PEN/PET bottles under long term storage: A comparison to packaging in ordinary PET bottles

AUTHORS: Zi-Chun Wang, Yu-Xi Yin, Huan-Ping Ao, Hao Yin, Di-Feng Ren, Jun Lu

JOURNAL: Food chemistry

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
The shelf life of chestnut rose beverage is largely dependent on packaging method and storage temperature. In this study, we investigated the effects of packaging beverages in bottles made of either polyethylene terephthalate (PET) or PEN (polyethylene naphthalate)/PET and storage temperature (4, 25, 37, and 55 ℃) on the shelf life of chestnut rose beverage. The physicochemical parameters and enzyme activity of beverages were evaluated, and we found that at 4 °C, the vitamin C, superoxide dismutase, and total polyphenol contents of beverages stored in PEN/PET bottles increased by 9.95 ± 0.49%, 2.86 ± 0.13%, and 3.23 ± 0.09% respectively, compared to beverages in ordinary PET bottles. In addition, other characteristic indicators including total soluble solids, browning index, and color value were also significantly improved. A shelf-life model was established based on the Arrhenius equation, and it will help distributors and consumers to determine the storage time and optimal shelf life of chestnut rose beverage.

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) is a cytoplasmic enzyme that modulates intracellular transport and protein quality control. Inhibition of HDAC6 deacetylase activity has shown beneficial effects in disease models, including Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This first-in-human positron emission tomography (PET) study evaluated the brain binding of [18F]EKZ-001 ([18F]Bavarostat), a radiotracer selective for HDAC6, in healthy adult subjects.

Methods: Biodistribution and radiation dosimetry studies were performed in four healthy subjects (2M/2F, 23.5 ± 2.4 years) using sequential whole-body PET/CT. The most appropriate kinetic model to quantify brain uptake was determined in 12 healthy subjects (6M/6F, 57.6 ± 3.7 years) from 120-min dynamic PET/MR scans using a radiometabolite-corrected arterial plasma input function. Four subjects underwent retest scans (2M/2F, 57.3 ± 5.6 years) with a 1-day interscan interval to determine test-retest variability (TRV). Regional volume of distribution (VT) was calculated using one-tissue and two-tissue compartment models (1-2TCM) and Logan graphical analysis (LGA), with time-stability assessed. VTdifferences between males and females were evaluated using volume of interest and whole-brain voxel-wise approaches.

Results: The effective dose was 39.1 ± 7.0 μSv/MBq. Based on the Akaike information criterion, 2TCM was the preferred model compared to 1TCM. Regional LGA VTwere in agreement with 2TCM VT, however demonstrated a lower absolute TRV of 7.7 ± 4.9%. Regional VTvalues were relatively homogeneous with highest values in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. Reduction of acquisition time was achieved with a 0 to 60-min scan followed by a 90 to 120-min scan. Males demonstrated significantly higher VTthan females in the majority of cortical and subcortical brain regions. No relevant radiotracer related adverse events were reported.

Conclusion: [18F]EKZ-001 is safe and appropriate for quantifying HDAC6 expression in the human brain with Logan graphical analysis as the preferred quantitative approach. Males showed higher HDAC6 expression across the brain compared to females.

JOURNAL: Diabetes, obesity & metabolism

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Aims: To assess the impact of various patient characteristics on the dynamics of liver glucose metabolism using automated multiparametric imaging with whole-body dynamic18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET).

Materials and methods: We retrospectively enrolled 540 patients who underwent whole-body dynamic FDG-PET. Three quantitative indices representing hepatic glucose metabolism [mean standardized uptake value normalized by lean body mass (SULmean), metabolic glucose rate (kinetic index) and distribution volume (DV)] were measured from multiparametric PET images produced automatically based on the Patlak plot model. Patient characteristics including age, sex, body mass index, fasting time, blood glucose level, and the presence of diabetes mellitus (DM) or hepatic steatosis (HS) were collected. We examined the correlations between the characteristic factors and three quantitative indices using multiple regression analysis.

Results: The success rate of kinetic analysis using multiparametric PET imaging was 93.3% (504/540). Hepatic SULmean was significantly correlated with age (p < .001), sex (p < .001) and blood glucose level (p = .002). DV was significantly correlated with age (p = .033), sex (p < .001), body mass index (p = .002), fasting time (p = .043) and the presence of HS (p = .002). The kinetic index was significantly correlated with age (p < .001) and sex (p = .004). In the comparison of the healthy, DM and HS groups, patients with DM had a significantly increased SULmean, whereas patients with HS had a significantly decreased DV.

Conclusions: Our results showed that liver glucose metabolism was influenced by various patient characteristic factors. Multiparametric FDG-PET imaging can be used to analyse the kinetics of liver glucose metabolism in routine clinical practice.

ABSTRACT:
Introduction: Screening potential participants in Alzheimer's disease (AD) clinical trials with amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) is often time consuming and expensive.

Methods: A web-based application was developed to model the time and financial cost of screening for AD clinical trials. Four screening approaches were compared; three approaches included an AD blood test at different stages of the screening process.

Results: The traditional screening approach using only amyloid PET was the most time consuming and expensive. Incorporating an AD blood test at any point in the screening process decreased both the time and financial cost of trial enrollment. Improvements in AD blood test accuracy over currently available tests only marginally increased savings. Use of a high specificity cut-off may improve the feasibility of screening with only an AD blood test.

Discussion: Incorporating AD blood tests into screening for AD clinical trials may reduce the time and financial cost of enrollment.

Highlights: The time and cost of enrolling participants in Alzheimer's disease (AD) clinical trials were modeled. A web-based application was developed to enable evaluation of key parameters. AD blood tests may decrease the time and financial cost of clinical trial enrollment. Improvements in AD blood test accuracy only marginally increased savings. Use of a high specificity cut-off may enable screening with only an AD blood test.

TITLE: A Comparison of Arterial Input Function Interpolation Methods for Patlak Plot Analysis of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET Prostate Cancer Studies

AUTHORS: Nathaniel J Smith, David T Newton, David Gunderman, Gary D Hutchins

JOURNAL: IEEE transactions on medical imaging

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging enables quantitative assessment of tissue physiology. Dynamic pharmacokinetic analysis of PET images requires accurate estimation of the radiotracer plasma input function to derive meaningful parameter estimates, and small discrepancies in parameter estimation can mimic subtle physiologic tissue variation. This study evaluates the impact of input function interpolation method on the accuracy of Patlak kinetic parameter estimation through simulations modeling the pharmacokinetic properties of [68Ga]-PSMA-11. This study evaluated both trained and untrained methods. Although the mean kinetic parameter accuracy was similar across all interpolation models, the trained node weighting interpolation model estimated accurate kinetic parameters with reduced overall variability relative to standard linear interpolation. Trained node weighting interpolation reduced kinetic parameter estimation variance by a magnitude approximating the underlying physiologic differences between normal and diseased prostatic tissue. Overall, this analysis suggests that trained node weighting improves the reliability of Patlak kinetic parameter estimation for [68Ga]-PSMA-11 PET.

AUTHORS: Hui Liu, Zonghua Luo, Jiwei Gu, Hao Jiang, Sumit Joshi, Kooresh I Shoghi, Yun Zhou, Robert J Gropler, Tammie L S Benzinger, Zhude Tu

JOURNAL: Molecular imaging and biology

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: The sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1PR1) is an important biomarker for imaging inflammation in the central nervous system (CNS). Herein, we report our recent evaluation of four18F-labeled S1PR1 tracers (18F-TZ43113,18F-TZ35104,18F-TZ4877, and18F-TZ4881) in a rat model of multiple sclerosis (MS).

Procedures: MicroPET studies of each tracer's uptake and kinetics were performed in an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) rat model of MS to quantify upregulated S1PR1 expression in the lumbar spinal cord of EAE rats. Western blot analysis was conducted to confirm the differences in the expression of S1PR1 protein level between EAE and sham rats. Radiometabolite analysis was performed for the most promising candidate in rats.

Results: All four S1PR1 tracers detected increased S1PR1 levels in response to neuroinflammation in the lumbar spinal cord of EAE rats, which was supported by western blot results. The ranked order of tracer uptake in rat spinal cord was18F-TZ4877 >18F-TZ4881 >18F-TZ35104 >18F-TZ43113.18F-TZ4877 had the highest uptake of the four tracers and showed good kinetic modeling fits in rat spinal cord using an image-based method of arterial blood input function. Radiometabolite analysis of18F-TZ4877 showed good in vivo stability with no major radiometabolite accumulation in the rat brain.

Conclusion: Among these four new PET tracers,18F-TZ4877 showed the most favorable profile for assessing S1PR1 expression in the EAE rat model of MS. Further characterization of these radiotracers in other models of neuroinflammation is warranted to identify a promising18F-labeled tracer for imaging S1PR1 in vivo.

TITLE: Development of a minimally invasive simultaneous estimation method for quantifying translocator protein binding with [18F]FEPPA positron emission tomography

AUTHORS: Praveen Dassanayake, Udunna C Anazodo, Linshan Liu, Lucas Narciso, Maryssa Iacobelli, Justin Hicks, Pablo Rusjan, Elizabeth Finger, Keith St Lawrence

JOURNAL: EJNMMI research

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Background: The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility of using a minimally invasive simultaneous estimation method (SIME) to quantify the binding of the 18-kDa translocator protein tracer [18F]FEPPA. Arterial sampling was avoided by extracting an image-derived input function (IDIF) that was metabolite-corrected using venous blood samples. The possibility of reducing scan duration to 90 min from the recommended 2-3 h was investigated by assuming a uniform non-displaceable distribution volume (VND) to simplify the SIME fitting.

Results: SIME was applied to retrospective data from healthy volunteers and was comprised of both high-affinity binders (HABs) and mixed-affinity binders (MABs). Estimates of global VNDand regional total distribution volume (VT) from SIME were not significantly different from values obtained using a two-tissue compartment model (2CTM). Regional VTestimates were greater for HABs compared to MABs for both the 2TCM and SIME, while the SIME estimates had lower inter-subject variability (41 ± 17% reduction). Binding potential (BPND) values calculated from regional VTand brain-wide VNDestimates were also greater for HABs, and reducing the scan time from 120 to 90 min had no significant effect on BPND. The feasibility of using venous metabolite correction was evaluated in a large animal model involving a simultaneous collection of arterial and venous samples. Strong linear correlations were found between venous and arterial measurements of the blood-to-plasma ratio and the remaining [18F]FEPPA fraction. Lastly, estimates of BPNDand the specific distribution volume (i.e., VS= VT- VND) from a separate group of healthy volunteers (90 min scan time, venous-scaled IDIFs) agreed with estimates from the retrospective data for both genotypes.

Conclusions: The results of this study demonstrate that accurate estimates of regional VT, BPNDand VScan be obtained by applying SIME to [18F]FEPPA data. Furthermore, the application of SIME enabled the scan time to be reduced to 90 min, and the approach worked well with IDIFs that were scaled and metabolite-corrected using venous blood samples.

TITLE: Brain PET imaging using 11C-flumazenil and 11C-buprenorphine does not support the hypothesis of a mutual interaction between buprenorphine and benzodiazepines at the neuroreceptor level

ABSTRACT:
Among opioids, buprenorphine presents a favorable safety profile with a limited risk of respiratory depression. However, fatalities have been reported when buprenorphine is combined to a benzodiazepine. Potentiation of buprenorphine interaction with opioid receptors (ORs) with benzodiazepines, and/or vice versa, is hypothesized to explain this drug-drug interaction (DDI). The mutual DDI between buprenorphine and benzodiazepines was investigated at the neuroreceptor level in nonhuman primates (n = 4 individuals) using brain PET imaging and kinetic modelling. The binding potential (BPND) of benzodiazepine receptor (BzR) was assessed using11C-flumazenil PET imaging before and after administration of buprenorphine (0.2 mg, i.v.). Moreover, the brain kinetics and receptor binding of buprenorphine were investigated in the same individuals using11C-buprenorphine PET imaging before and after administration of diazepam (10 mg, i.v.). Outcome parameters were compared using a two-way ANOVA. Buprenorphine did not impact the plasma nor brain kinetics of11C-flumazenil.11C-flumazenil BPNDwas unchanged following buprenorphine exposure, in any brain region (p > 0.05). Similarly, diazepam did not impact the plasma or brain kinetics of11C-buprenorphine.11C-buprenorphine volume of distribution (VT) was unchanged following diazepam exposure, in any brain region (p > 0.05). To conclude, our PET imaging findings do not support a neuropharmacokinetic or neuroreceptor-related mechanism of the buprenorphine/benzodiazepine interaction.

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Background: Tumour hypoxia is associated with increased metastasis, invasion, poor therapy response and prognosis. Most PET radiotracers developed and used for clinical hypoxia imaging belong to the 2-nitroimidazole family. Recently we have developed novel 2-nitroimidazole-derived PET radiotracer [18F]FBNA (N-(4-[18F]fluoro-benzyl)-2-(2-nitro-1H-imidazol-1-yl)-acet-amide), an18F-labeled analogue of antiparasitic drug benznidazole. The present study aimed to analyze its radio-pharmacological properties and systematically compare its PET imaging profiles with [18F]FMISO and [18F]FAZA in preclinical triple-negative (MDA-MB231) and estrogen receptor-positive (MCF-7) breast cancer models.

Methods: In vitro cellular uptake experiments were carried out in MDA-MB321 and MCF-7 cells under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Metabolic stability in vivo was determined in BALB/c mice using radio-TLC analysis. Dynamic PET experiments over 3 h post-injection were performed in MDA-MB231 and MCF-7 tumour-bearing mice. Those PET data were used for kinetic modelling analysis utilizing the reversible two-tissue-compartment model. Autoradiography was carried out in tumour tissue slices and compared to HIF-1α immunohistochemistry. Detailed ex vivo biodistribution was accomplished in BALB/c mice, and this biodistribution data were used for dosimetry calculation.

Results: Under hypoxic conditions in vitro cellular uptake was elevated in both cell lines, MCF-7 and MDA-MB231, for all three radiotracers. After intravenous injection, [18F]FBNA formed two radiometabolites, resulting in a final fraction of 65 ± 9 % intact [18F]FBNA after 60 min p.i. After 3 h p.i., [18F]FBNA tumour uptake reached SUV values of 0.78 ± 0.01 in MCF-7 and 0.61 ± 0.04 in MDA-MB231 tumours (both n = 3), representing tumour-to-muscle ratios of 2.19 ± 0.04 and 1.98 ± 0.15, respectively. [18F]FMISO resulted in higher tumour uptakes (SUV 1.36 ± 0.04 in MCF-7 and 1.23 ± 0.08 in MDA-MB231 (both n = 4; p < 0.05) than [18F]FAZA (0.66 ± 0.11 in MCF-7 and 0.63 ± 0.14 in MDA-MB231 (both n = 4; n.s.)), representing tumour-to-muscle ratios of 3.24 ± 0.30 and 3.32 ± 0.50 for [18F]FMISO, and 2.92 ± 0.74 and 3.00 ± 0.42 for [18F]FAZA, respectively. While the fraction per time of radiotracer entering the second compartment (k3) was similar within uncertainties for all three radiotracers in MDA-MB231 tumours, it was different in MCF-7 tumours. The ratios k3/(k3 + k2) and K1*k3/(k3 + k2) in MCF-7 tumours were also significantly different, indicating dissimilar fractions of radiotracer bound and trapped intracellularly: K1*k3/(k2 + k3) [18F]FMISO (0.0088 ± 0.001)/min, n = 4; p < 0.001) > [18F]FAZA (0.0052 ± 0.002)/min, n = 4; p < 0.01) > [18F]FBNA (0.003 ± 0.001)/min, n = 3). In contrast, in MDA-MB231 tumours, only K1 was significantly elevated for [18F]FMISO. However, this did not result in significant differences for K1*k3/(k2 + k3) for all three 2-nitroimidazoles in MDA-MB231 tumours.

Conclusion: Novel 2-nitroimidazole PET radiotracer [18F]FBNA showed uptake into hypoxic breast cancer cells and tumour tissue presumably associated with elevated HIF1-α expression. Systematic comparison of PET imaging performance with [18F]FMISO and [18F]FAZA in different types of preclinical breast cancer models revealed a similar tumour uptake profile for [18F]FBNA with [18F]FAZA and, despite its higher lipophilicity, still a slightly higher muscle tissue clearance compared to [18F]FMISO.

ABSTRACT:
The aim of this work was to quantify the uptake of18F-BMS-986192, a programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) adnectin PET tracer, in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. To this end, plasma input kinetic modeling of dynamic tumor uptake data with online arterial blood sampling was performed. In addition, the accuracy of simplified uptake metrics such as SUV was investigated.Methods:Data from a study with18F-BMS-986192 in patients with advanced-stage non-small cell lung cancer eligible for nivolumab treatment were used if a dynamic scan was available and lesions were present in the field of view of the dynamic scan. After injection of18F-BMS-986192, a 60-min dynamic PET/CT scan was started, followed by a 30-min whole-body PET/CT scan. Continuous arterial and discrete arterial and venous blood sampling were performed to determine a plasma input function. Tumor time-activity curves were fitted by several plasma input kinetic models. Simplified uptake parameters included tumor-to-blood ratio as well as several SUV measures.Results:Twenty-two tumors in 9 patients were analyzed. The arterial plasma input single-tissue reversible compartment model with fitted blood volume fraction seems to be the most preferred model as it best fitted 11 of 18 tumor time-activity curves. The distribution volume (VT) ranged from 0.4 to 4.8 mL⋅cm-3Similar values were obtained with an image-derived input function. From the simplified measures, SUV normalized for body weight at 50 and 67 min after injection correlated best withVT, with anR2of more than 0.9.Conclusion:A single-tissue reversible model can be used to quantify tumor uptake of the PD-L1 PET tracer18F-BMS-986192. SUV at 60 min after injection, normalized for body weight, is an accurate simplified parameter for uptake assessment of baseline studies. To assess its predictive value for response evaluation during programmed cell death protein 1 or PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibition, further validation of SUV againstVTbased on an image-derived input function is recommended.

ABSTRACT:
Background:Radiolabeled agents that are substrates for the norepinephrine transporter (NET) can be used to quantify cardiac sympathetic nervous conditions and have been demonstrated to identify high-risk congestive heart failure (HF) patients prone to arrhythmic events. We aimed to fully characterize the kinetic profile of the novel18F-labeled NET probe AF78 for PET imaging of the cardiac sympathetic nervous system (SNS) among various species.Methods:18F-AF78 was compared to norepinephrine (NE) and established SNS radiotracers by employingin vitrocell assays, followed by anin vivo PET imagingapproach with healthy rats, rabbits and nonhuman primates (NHPs). Additionally, chase protocols were performed in NHPs with NET inhibitor desipramine (DMI) and the NE releasing stimulator tyramine (TYR) to investigate retention kinetics in cardiac SNS.Results:Relative to other SNS radiotracers,18F-AF78 showed higher transport affinity via NET in a cell-based competitive uptake assay (IC500.42 ± 0.14 µM), almost identical to that of NE (IC50, 0.50 ± 0.16 µM, n.s.). In rabbits and NHPs, initial cardiac uptake was significantly reduced by NET inhibition. Furthermore, cardiac tracer retention was not affected by a DMI chase protocol but was markedly reduced by intermittent TYR chase, thereby suggesting that18F-AF78 is stored and can be released via the synaptic vesicular turnover process. Computational modeling hypothesized the formation of a T-shaped π-π stacking at the binding site, suggesting a rationale for the high affinity of18F-AF78.Conclusion:18F-AF78 demonstrated highin vitroNET affinity and advantageousin vivoradiotracer kinetics across various species, indicating that18F-AF78 is an SNS imaging agent with strong potential to guide specific interventions in cardiovascular medicine.

TITLE: Reproducibility of [18F]MK-6240 kinetics in brain studies with shortened dynamic PET protocol in healthy/cognitively normal subjects

AUTHORS: Phelipi N Schuck, Xiuyuan H Wang, Emily B Tanzi, Sally Xie, Yi Li, Sadek A Nehmeh

JOURNAL: EJNMMI physics

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Background: [18F]MK-6240 is a neurofibrillary tangles PET radiotracer that has been broadly used in aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD) studies. Majority of [18F]MK-6240 PET studies use dynamic acquisitions longer than 60 min to assess the tracer kinetic parameters. As of today, no consensus has been established on the optimum dynamic PET scan time. In this study, we assess the reproducibility of [18F]MK-6240 quantitative metrics using shortest dynamic PET protocols in cognitively normal subjects. PET metrics were measured through two-tissue compartment model (2TCM) and Logan model to estimate VT and DVR, as well as SUVR from 90 to 120 min (SUVR90 - 120 min) post-tracer injection for brain regions. 2TCM was carried out using the 120 min dynamic coffee break dataset (first scan from 0 to 60 min p.i., second scan from 90 to 120 min p.i.) and then repeated after stepwise shortening it by 5 min. The dynamic scan length that reproduced the 120 min dynamic scans-based VT to within 10% error was defined as the shortest acquisition time (SAT). The SAT SUVR90 - 120 minwas deduced from the SAT dataset by extrapolation of each image pixel time-activity curve to 120 min. The reproducibility of the 120 min dynamic scans-based VT2TCM, DVR2TCM, DVRLogan, and SUVR using the SAT was assessed using Passing-Bablock analysis. The limits of reproducibility of each PET metrics were determined using Bland-Altman analysis.

Results: A dynamic SAT of 40 min yielded < 10% error in [18F]MK-6240 VT2TCM's for all brain regions, compared to those measured using the 120 min datasets. SAT-based analysis did not show statistically significant systemic or proportional biases in VT2TCM, DVR2TCM, DVRLogan, or SUVR compared to those deduced from the full dynamic dataset of 120 min. A mean difference between the 120 min- and SAT-based analysis of less than 4%, 10%, 15%, and 20% existed in the VT2TCM, DVR2TCM, DVRLogan, and SUVR respectively.

Conclusion: Kinetic modeling of [18F]MK-6240 PET can be accurately performed using dynamic scan times as short as 40 min. This can facilitate studies with [18F]MK-6240 PET and improve patients accrual. Further work would be necessary to confirm the reproducibility of these results for patients in dementia spectra.

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Currently, there are multiple active clinical trials involving poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors in the treatment of glioblastoma. The noninvasive quantification of baseline PARP expression using positron emission tomography (PET) may provide prognostic information and lead to more precise treatment. Due to the lack of brain-penetrant PARP imaging agents, the reliable and accurate in vivo quantification of PARP in the brain remains elusive. Herein, we report the synthesis of a brain-penetrant PARP PET tracer, (R)-2-(2-methyl-1-(methyl-11C)pyrrolidin-2-yl)-1H-benzo[d]imidazole-4-carboxamide ([11C]PyBic), and its preclinical evaluations in a syngeneic RG2 rat glioblastoma model and healthy nonhuman primates.

Methods: We synthesized [11C]PyBic using veliparib as the labeling precursor, performed dynamic PET scans on RG2 tumor-bearing rats and calculated the distribution volume ratio (DVR) using simplified reference region method 2 (SRTM2) with the contralateral nontumor brain region as the reference region. We performed biodistribution studies, western blot, and immunostaining studies to validate the in vivo PET quantification results. We characterized the brain kinetics and binding specificity of [11C]PyBic in nonhuman primates on FOCUS220 scanner and calculated the volume of distribution (VT), nondisplaceable volume of distribution (VND), and nondisplaceable binding potential (BPND) in selected brain regions.

Results: [11C]PyBic was synthesized efficiently in one step, with greater than 97% radiochemical and chemical purity and molar activity of 148 ± 85 MBq/nmol (n = 6). [11C]PyBic demonstrated PARP-specific binding in RG2 tumors, with 74% of tracer binding in tumors blocked by preinjected veliparib (i.v., 5 mg/kg). The in vivo PET imaging results were corroborated by ex vivo biodistribution, PARP1 immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting data. Furthermore, brain penetration of [11C]PyBic was confirmed by quantitative monkey brain PET, which showed high specific uptake (BPND> 3) and low nonspecific uptake (VND< 3 mL/cm3) in the monkey brain.

Conclusion: [11C]PyBic is the first brain-penetrant PARP PET tracer validated in a rat glioblastoma model and healthy nonhuman primates. The brain kinetics of [11C]PyBic are suitable for noninvasive quantification of available PARP binding in the brain, which posits [11C]PyBic to have broad applications in oncology and neuroimaging.

TITLE: Kinetics and toxicity of nanoplastics in ex vivo exposed human whole blood as a model to understand their impact on human health

AUTHORS: J Arribas Arranz, A Villacorta, L Rubio, A García-Rodríguez, G Sánchez, M Llorca, M Farre, J F Ferrer, R Marcos, A Hernández

JOURNAL: The Science of the total environment

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
The ubiquitous presence of nanoplastics (NPLs) in the environment is considered of great health concern. Due to their size, NPLs can cross both the intestinal and pulmonary barriers and, consequently, their presence in the blood compartment is expected. Understanding the interactions between NPLs and human blood components is required. In this study, to simulate more adequate real exposure conditions, the whole blood of healthy donors was exposed to five different NPLs: three polystyrene NPLs of approximately 50 nm (aminated PS-NH2, carboxylated PS-COOH, and pristine PS- forms), together with two true-to-life NPLs from polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polylactic acid (PLA) of about 150 nm. Internalization was determined in white blood cells (WBCs) by confocal microscopy, once the different main cell subtypes (monocytes, polymorphonucleated cells, and lymphocytes) were sorted by flow cytometry. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (iROS) induction was determined in WBCs and cytokine release in plasma. In addition, hemolysis, coagulation, and platelet activation were also determined. Results showed a differential uptake between WBC subtypes, with monocytes showing a higher internalization. Regarding iROS, lymphocytes were those with higher levels, which was observed for different NPLs. Changes in cytokine release were also detected, with higher effects observed after PLA- and PS-NH2-NPL exposure. Hemolysis induction was observed after PS- and PS-COOH-NPL exposure, but no effects on platelet functionality were observed after any of the treatments. To our knowledge, this is the first study comprehensively evaluating the bloodstream kinetics and toxicity of NPL from different polymeric types on human whole blood, considering the role played by the cell subtype and the NPLs physicochemical characteristics in the effects observed after the exposures.

TITLE: First-in-Human Assessment of 11C-LSN3172176, an M1 Muscarinic Acetylcholine Receptor PET Radiotracer

ABSTRACT:
This was a first-in-human study of the PET radiotracer11C-LSN3172176 for the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor subtype M1. The objectives of the study were to determine the appropriate kinetic model to quantify binding of the tracer to M1 receptors, and the reliability of the chosen quantification method.Methods:Six healthy subjects completed the test-retest protocol, and 5 healthy subjects completed the baseline-scopolamine blocking protocol. Multiple modeling methods were applied to calculate total distribution volume (VT) and nondisplaceable binding potential (BPND) in various brain regions. The reference region was selected from the blocking study. The occupancy plot was applied to compute receptor occupancy by scopolamine and nondisplaceable distribution volume.Results:Tracer uptake was highest in the striatum, followed by neocortical regions and white matter, and lowest in the cerebellum. Regional time-activity curves were fitted well by all models. The 2-tissue-compartment (2TC) model fits were good, but the 2TC parameters often could not be reliably estimated. BecauseVTcorrelated well between the 2TC and 1-tissue-compartment (1TC) models after exclusion of unreliable estimates, the 1TC model was chosen as the most appropriate. The cerebellum showed the lowestVT, consistent with preclinical studies showing little to no specific binding in the region. Further, cerebellarVTdid not change between baseline and blocking scans, indicating that the cerebellum is a suitable reference region. The simplified reference tissue model (SRTM) slightly underestimated 1TCBPND, and the simplified reference tissue model 2 (SRTM2) improvedBPNDestimation. An 80-min scan was sufficient to quantifyVTandBPNDThe test-retest study showed excellent absolute test-retest variability for 1TCVT(≤5%) andBPND(≤10%). In the baseline and blocking studies, occupancy values were lower in the striatum than in nonstriatal regions, as may be attributed to differences in regional acetylcholine concentrations.Conclusion:The 1TC and SRTM2 models are appropriate for quantitative analysis of11C-LSN3172176 imaging data.11C-LSN3172176 displayed excellent test-retest reproducibility and is a highly promising ligand to quantify M1 receptors in the human brain.

ABSTRACT:
Introduction SUV measurements from static brain [18F]FDG PET acquisitions are a commonly used tool in preclinical research, providing a simple alternative for kinetic modelling, which requires complex and time-consuming dynamic acquisitions. However, SUV can be severely affected by the animal handling and preconditioning protocols, primarily by those that may induce changes in blood glucose levels (BGL). Here, we aimed at developing and investigating the feasibility of SUV-based approaches for a wide range of BGL far beyond normal values, and consequently, to develop and validate a new model to generate standardized and reproducible SUV measurements for any BGL. Material and methods We performed dynamic and static brain [18F]FDG PET acquisitions in 52 male Sprague-Dawley rats sorted into control (n = 10), non-fasting (n = 14), insulin-induced hypoglycemia (n = 12) and glucagon-induced hyperglycemia (n = 16) groups. Brain [18F]FDG PET images were cropped, aligned and co-registered to a standard template to calculate whole-brain and regional SUV. Cerebral Metabolic Rate of Glucose (CMRglc) was also estimated from 2-Tissue Compartment Model (2TCM) and Patlak plot for validation purposes. Results Our results showed that BGL=100±6 mg/dL can be considered a reproducible reference value for normoglycemia. Furthermore, we successfully established a 2nd-degree polynomial model (C1=0.66E-4, C2=-0.0408 and C3=7.298) relying exclusively on BGL measures at pre-[18F]FDG injection time, that characterizes more precisely the relationship between SUV and BGL for a wide range of BGL values (from 10 to 338 mg/dL). We confirmed the ability of this model to generate corrected SUV estimations that are highly correlated to CMRglc estimations (R2= 0.54 2TCM CMRgluc and R2= 0.49 Patlak CMRgluc). Besides, slight regional differences in SUV were found in animals from extreme BGL groups, showing that [18F]FDG uptake is mostly directed toward central regions of the brain when BGLs are significantly decreased. Conclusion Our study successfully established a non-linear model that relies exclusively on pre-scan BGL measurements to characterize the relationship between [18F]FDG SUV and BGL. The extensive validation confirmed its ability to generate SUV-based surrogates of CMRglu along a wide range of BGL and it holds the potential to be adopted as a standard protocol by the preclinical neuroimaging community using brain [18F]FDG PET imaging.

TITLE: Reduced Acquisition Time [18F]GE-180 PET Scanning Protocol Replaces Gold-Standard Dynamic Acquisition in a Mouse Ischemic Stroke Model

JOURNAL: Frontiers in medicine

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Aim: Understanding neuroinflammation after acute ischemic stroke is a crucial step on the way to an individualized post-stroke treatment. Microglia activation, an essential part of neuroinflammation, can be assessed using [18F]GE-180 18 kDa translocator protein positron emission tomography (TSPO-PET). However, the commonly used 60-90 min post-injection (p.i.) time window was not yet proven to be suitable for post-stroke neuroinflammation assessment. In this study, we compare semi-quantitative estimates derived from late time frames to quantitative estimates calculated using a full 0-90 min dynamic scan in a mouse photothrombotic stroke (PT) model.

Materials and methods: Six mice after PT and six sham mice were included in the study. For a half of the mice, we acquired four serial 0-90 min scans per mouse (analysis cohort) and calculated standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs; cerebellar reference) for the PT volume of interest (VOI) in five late 10 min time frames as well as distribution volume ratios (DVRs) for the same VOI. We compared late static 10 min SUVRs and the 60-90 min time frame of the analysis cohort to the corresponding DVRs by linear fitting. The other half of the animals received a static 60-90 min scan and was used as a validation cohort. We extrapolated DVRs by using the static 60-90 min p.i. time window, which were compared to the DVRs of the analysis cohort.

Results: We found high linear correlations between SUVRs and DVRs in the analysis cohort for all studied 10 min time frames, while the fits of the 60-70, 70-80, and 80-90 min p.i. time frames were the ones closest to the line of identity. For the 60-90 min time window, we observed an excellent linear correlation between SUVR and DVR regardless of the phenotype (PTvs. sham). The extrapolated DVRs of the validation cohort were not significantly different from the DVRs of the analysis group.

Conclusion: Simplified quantification by a reference tissue ratio of the late 60-90 min p.i. [18F]GE-180 PET image can replace full quantification of a dynamic scan for assessment of microglial activation in the mouse PT model.

JOURNAL: Neural regeneration research

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
11C-PK11195 is a positron emitter tracer used for Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging of innate immune cell activation in studies of neuroinflammatory diseases. For the image quantitative analysis, it is necessary to quantify the intact fraction of this tracer in the arterial plasma during imaging acquisition (plasma intact fraction). Due to the complexity and costs involved in this analysis it is important to evaluate the real necessity of individual analysis in each11C-PK11195 PET imaging acquisition. The purpose of this study is to compare11C-PK11195 plasma metabolization rate between healthy controls and multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and evaluate the interference of sex, age, treatment, and disease phenotype in the tracer intact fraction measured in arterial plasma samples.11C-PK11195 metabolization rate in arterial plasma was quantified by high performance liquid chromatography in samples from MS patients (n = 50) and healthy controls (n = 23) at 20, 45, and 60 minutes after11C-PK11195 injection. Analyses were also stratified by sex, age, treatment type, and MS phenotype. The results showed no significant differences in the metabolization rate of healthy controls and MS patients, or in the stratified samples. In conclusion,11C-PK11195 metabolization has the same rate in patients with MS and healthy controls, which is not affected by sex, age, treatment, and disease phenotype. Thus, these findings could contribute to exempting the necessity for tracer metabolization determination in all11C-PK11195 PET imaging acquisition, by using a population metabolization rate average. The study procedures were approved by the Ethics Committee for Research Projects Analysis of the Hospital das Clinicas of the University of Sao Paulo Medical School (approval No. 624.065) on April 23, 2014.

TITLE: Dynamic 18F-FDopa PET Imaging for Newly Diagnosed Gliomas: Is a Semiquantitative Model Sufficient?

AUTHORS: Timothée Zaragori, Matthieu Doyen, Fabien Rech, Marie Blonski, Luc Taillandier, Laëtitia Imbert, Antoine Verger

JOURNAL: Frontiers in oncology

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Dynamic amino acid positron emission tomography (PET) has become essential in neuro-oncology, most notably for its prognostic value in the noninvasive prediction of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutations in newly diagnosed gliomas. The 6-[18F]fluoro-l-DOPA (18F-FDOPA) kinetic model has an underlying complexity, while previous studies have predominantly used a semiquantitative dynamic analysis. Our study addresses whether a semiquantitative analysis can capture all the relevant information contained in time-activity curves for predicting the presence of IDH mutations compared to the more sophisticated graphical and compartmental models.

Methods: Thirty-seven tumour time-activity curves from18F-FDOPA PET dynamic acquisitions of newly diagnosed gliomas (median age = 58.3 years, range = 20.3-79.9 years, 16 women, 16 IDH-wild type) were analyzed with a semiquantitative model based on classical parameters, with (SQ) or without (Ref SQ) a reference region, or on parameters of a fit function (SQ Fit), a graphical Logan model with input function (Logan) or reference region (Ref Logan), and a two-tissue compartmental model previously reported for18F-FDOPA PET imaging of gliomas (2TCM). The overall predictive performance of each model was assessed with an area under the curve (AUC) comparison using multivariate analysis of all the parameters included in the model. Moreover, each extracted parameter was assessed in a univariate analysis by a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis.

Results: The SQ model with an AUC of 0.733 for predicting IDH mutations showed comparable performance to the other models with AUCs of 0.752, 0.814, 0.693, 0.786, and 0.863, respectively corresponding to SQ Fit, Ref SQ, Logan, Ref Logan, and 2TCM (p≥ 0.10 for the pairwise comparisons with other models). In the univariate analysis, the SQ time-to-peak parameter had the best diagnostic performance (75.7% accuracy) compared to all other individual parameters considered.

Conclusions: The SQ model circumvents the complexities of the18F-FDOPA kinetic model and yields similar performance in predicting IDH mutations when compared to the other models, most notably the compartmental model. Our study provides supportive evidence for the routine clinical application of the SQ model for the dynamic analysis of18F-FDOPA PET images in newly diagnosed gliomas.

TITLE: [18F]-(2S,4R)4-Fluoroglutamine PET Imaging of Glutamine Metabolism in Murine Models of Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)

AUTHORS: Youngho Seo, Miranda C Craig, Stephanie T Murphy, Jinjin Feng, Xin Chen, Mariia Yuneva

JOURNAL: Molecular imaging

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Quantitativein vivo[18F]-(2S,4R)4-fluoroglutamine ([18F]4-FGln or more simply [18F]FGln) metabolic kinetic parameters are compared with activity levels of glutamine metabolism in different types of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

Methods: For this study, we used two transgenic mouse models of HCC induced by protooncogenes, MYC, and MET. Biochemical data have shown that tumors induced by MYC have increased levels of glutamine metabolism compared to those induced by MET. One-hour dynamic [18F]FGln PET data were acquired and reconstructed for fasted MYC mice (n= 11 tumors from 7 animals), fasted MET mice (n= 8 tumors from 6 animals), fasted FVBN controls (n= 8 normal liver regions from 6 animals), nonfasted MYC mice (n= 16 tumors from 6 animals), and nonfasted FVBN controls (n= 8 normal liver regions from 3 animals). The influx rate constants (K1) using the one-tissue compartment model were derived for each tumor with the left ventricular blood pool input function.

Results: Influx rate constants were significantly higher for MYC tumors (K1= 0.374 ± 0.133) than for MET tumors (K1= 0.141 ± 0.058) under fasting conditions (P= 0.0002). Rate constants were also significantly lower for MET tumors (K1= 0.141 ± 0.135) than normal livers (K1= 0.332 ± 0.179) under fasting conditions (P= 0.0123). Fasting conditions tested for MYC tumors and normal livers did not result in any significant difference withPvalues > 0.005.

Conclusion: Higher influx rate constants corresponded to elevated levels of glutamine metabolism as determined by biochemical assays. The data showed that there is a distinctive difference in glutamine metabolism between MYC and MET tumors. Our study has demonstrated the potential of [18F]FGln PET imaging as a tool to assess glutamine metabolism in HCC tumorsin vivowith a caution that it may not be able to clearly distinguish HCC tumors from normal liver tissue.

TITLE: A Short Dynamic Scan Method of Measuring Bone Metabolic Flux Using [18F]NaF PET

AUTHORS: Tanuj Puri, Musib M Siddique, Michelle L Frost, Amelia E B Moore, Glen M Blake

JOURNAL: Tomography (Ann Arbor, Mich.)

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
[18F]NaF PET measurements of bone metabolic flux (Ki) are conventionally obtained with 60-min dynamic scans analysed using the Hawkins model. However, long scan times make this method expensive and uncomfortable for subjects. Therefore, we evaluated and compared measurements of Kiwith shorter scan times analysed with fixed values of the Hawkins model rate constants. The scans were acquired in a trial in 30 postmenopausal women, half treated with teriparatide (TPT) and half untreated. Sixty-minute PET-CT scans of both hips were acquired at baseline and week 12 after injection with 180 MBq [18F]NaF. Scans were analysed using the Hawkins model by fitting bone time-activity curves at seven volumes of interest (VOIs) with a semi-population arterial input function. The model was re-run with fixed rate-constants for dynamic scan times from 0-12 min increasing in 4-min steps up to 0-60 min. Using the Hawkins model with fixed rate-constants, Kimeasurements with statistical power equivalent or superior to conventionally analysed 60-min dynamic scans were obtained with scan times as short as 12 min.

TITLE: A short 18F-FDG imaging window triple injection neuroimaging protocol for parametric mapping in PET

AUTHORS: Hamed Moradi, Rajat Vashistha, Kieran O'Brien, Amanda Hammond, Viktor Vegh, David Reutens

JOURNAL: EJNMMI research

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Background: In parametric PET, kinetic parameters are extracted from dynamic PET images. It is not commonly used in clinical practice because of long scan times and the requirement for an arterial input function (AIF). To address these limitations, we designed an18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) triple injection dynamic PET protocol for brain imaging with a standard field of view PET scanner using a 24-min imaging window and an input function modeled using measurements from a region of interest placed over the left ventricle.

Methods: To test the protocol in 6 healthy participants, we examined the quality of voxel-based maps of kinetic parameters in the brain generated using the two-tissue compartment model and compared estimated parameter values with previously published values. We also utilized data from a 36-min validation imaging window to compare (1) the modeled AIF against the input function measured in the validation window; and (2) the net influx rate ([Formula: see text]) computed using parameter estimates from the short imaging window against the net influx rate obtained using Patlak analysis in the validation window.

Results: Compared to the AIF measured in the validation window, the input function estimated from the short imaging window achieved a mean area under the curve error of 9%. The voxel-wise Pearson's correlation between [Formula: see text] estimates from the short imaging window and the validation imaging window exceeded 0.95.

Conclusion: The proposed 24-min triple injection protocol enables parametric18F-FDG neuroimaging with noninvasive estimation of the AIF from cardiac images using a standard field of view PET scanner.

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) regulates cannabinoid neurotransmission and the pro-inflammatory arachidonic acid pathway by degrading endocannabinoids. MAGL inhibitors may accordingly act as cannabinoid-potentiating and anti-inflammatory agents. Although MAGL dysfunction has been implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders, it has never been visualized in vivo in human brain. The primary objective of the current study was to visualize MAGL in the human brain using the novel PET ligand18F-T-401.

Methods: Seven healthy males underwent 120-min dynamic18F-T-401-PET scans with arterial blood sampling. Six subjects also underwent a second PET scan with18F-T-401 within 2 weeks of the first scan. For quantification of MAGL in the human brain, kinetic analyses using one- and two-tissue compartment models (1TCM and 2TCM, respectively), along with multilinear analysis (MA1) and Logan graphical analysis, were performed. Time-stability and test-retest reproducibility of18F-T-401-PET were also evaluated.

Results: 18F-T-401 showed rapid uptake and gradual washout from the brain. Logan graphical analysis showed linearity in all subjects, indicating reversible radioligand kinetics. Using a metabolite-corrected arterial input function, MA1 estimated regional total distribution volume (VT) values by best identifiability. VTvalues were highest in the cerebral cortex, moderate in the thalamus and putamen, and lowest in white matter and the brainstem, which was in agreement with regional MAGL expression in the human brain. Time-stability analysis showed that MA1 estimated VTvalues with a minimal bias even using truncated 60-min scan data. Test-retest reliability was also excellent with the use of MA1.

Conclusions: Here, we provide the first demonstration of in vivo visualization of MAGL in the human brain.18F-T-401 showed excellent test-retest reliability, reversible kinetics, and stable estimation of VTvalues consistent with known regional MAGL expressions. PET with18F-T-401-PET is promising tool for measurement of central MAGL.

TITLE: Abbreviated scan protocols to capture 18F-FDG kinetics for long axial FOV PET scanners

AUTHORS: Varsha Viswanath, Hasan Sari, Austin R Pantel, Maurizio Conti, Margaret E Daube-Witherspoon, Clemens Mingels, Ian Alberts, Lars Eriksson, Kuangyu Shi, Axel Rominger, Joel S Karp

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Kinetic parameters from dynamic18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) imaging offer complementary insights to the study of disease compared to static clinical imaging. However, dynamic imaging protocols are cumbersome due to the long acquisition time. Long axial field-of-view (LAFOV) PET scanners (> 70 cm) have two advantages for dynamic imaging over clinical PET scanners with a standard axial field-of-view (SAFOV; 16-30 cm). The large axial coverage enables multi-organ dynamic imaging in a single bed position, and the high sensitivity may enable clinically routine abbreviated dynamic imaging protocols.

Methods: In this work, we studied two abbreviated protocols using data from a 65-min dynamic18F-FDG scan: (A) dynamic imaging immediately post-injection (p.i.) for variable durations, and (B) dynamic imaging immediately p.i. for variable durations plus a 1-h p.i. (5-min-long) datapoint. Nine cancer patients were imaged on the Biograph Vision Quadra (Siemens Healthineers). Time-activity curves over the lesions (N = 39) were fitted using the Patlak graphical analysis and a 2-tissue-compartment (2C, k4= 0) model for variable scan durations (5-60 min). Kinetic parameters from the complete dataset served as the reference. Lesions from all cancers were grouped into low, medium, and high flux groups, and bias and precision of Ki(Patlak) and Ki, K1, k2, and k3(2C) were calculated for each group.

Results: Using only early dynamic data with the 2C (or Patlak) model, accurate quantification of Kirequired at least 50 (or 55) min of dynamic data for low flux lesions, at least 30 (or 40) min for medium flux lesions, and at least 15 (or 20) min for high flux lesions to achieve both 10% bias and precision. The addition of the final (5-min) datapoint allowed for accurate quantification of Kiwith a bias and precision of 10% using only 10-15 min of early dynamic data for either model.

Conclusion: Dynamic imaging for 10-15 min immediately p.i. followed by a 5-min scan at 1-h p.i can accurately and precisely quantify18F-FDG on a long axial FOV scanner, potentially allowing for more widespread use of dynamic18F-FDG imaging.

TITLE: Assessment of cerebral drug occupancy in humans using a single PET-scan: A [11C]UCB-J PET study

AUTHORS: Maja R Marstrand-Joergensen, Gjertrud L Laurell, Susan Herrmann, Arafat Nasser, Annette Johansen, Anton Lund, Thomas L Andersen, Gitte M Knudsen, Lars H Pinborg

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Here, we evaluate a PET displacement model with a Single-step and Numerical solution in healthy individuals using the synaptic vesicle glycoprotein (SV2A) PET-tracer [11C]UCB-J and the anti-seizure medication levetiracetam (LEV). We aimed to (1) validate the displacement model by comparing the brain LEV-SV2A occupancy from a single PET scan with the occupancy derived from two PET scans and the Lassen plot and (2) determine the plasma LEV concentration-SV2A occupancy curve in healthy individuals.

Methods: Eleven healthy individuals (five females, mean age 35.5 [range: 25-47] years) underwent two 120-min [11C]UCB-J PET scans where an LEV dose (5-30 mg/kg) was administered intravenously halfway through the first PET scan to partially displace radioligand binding to SV2A. Five individuals were scanned twice on the same day; the remaining six were scanned once on two separate days, receiving two identical LEV doses. Arterial blood samples were acquired to determine the arterial input function and plasma LEV concentrations. Using the displacement model, the SV2A-LEV target engagement was calculated and compared with the Lassen plot method. The resulting data were fitted with a single-site binding model.

Results: SV2A occupancies and VNDestimates derived from the displacement model were not significantly different from the Lassen plot (p = 0.55 and 0.13, respectively). The coefficient of variation was 14.6% vs. 17.3% for the Numerical and the Single-step solution in Bland-Altman comparisons with the Lassen plot. The average half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50), as estimated from the area under the curve of the plasma LEV concentration, was 12.5 µg/mL (95% CI: 5-25) for the Single-Step solution, 11.8 µg/mL (95% CI: 4-25) for the Numerical solution, and 6.3 µg/mL (95% CI: 0.08-21) for the Lassen plot. Constraining Emax to 100% did not significantly improve model fits.

Conclusion: Plasma LEV concentration vs. SV2A occupancy can be determined in humans using a single PET scan displacement model. The average concentration of the three computed IC50values ranges between 6.3 and 12.5 µg/mL. The next step is to use the displacement model to evaluate LEV occupancy and corresponding plasma concentrations in relation to treatment efficacy.

JOURNAL: Frontiers in oncology

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: The three positron emission tomography (PET) imaging compounds: (2S,4R)-4-[18F]Fluoroglutamine ([18F]FGln),L-[methyl-11C]Methionine ([11C]Met), and 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose ([18F]FDG) were investigated to contrast their ability to image orthotopic BT4C gliomas in BDIX rats. Two separate small animal imaging systems were compared for their tumor detection potential. Dynamic acquisition of [18F]FGln was evaluated with multiple pharmacokinetic models for future quantitative comparison.

Procedures: Up to four imaging studies were performed on each orthotopically grafted BT4C glioma-bearing BDIX rat subject (n = 16) on four consecutive days. First, a DOTAREM®contrast enhanced MRI followed by attenuation correction CT and dynamic PET imaging with each radiopharmaceutical (20 min [11C]Met, 60 min [18F]FDG, and 60 min [18F]FGln with either the Molecubes PET/CT (n = 5) or Inveon PET/CT cameras (n = 11).Ex vivobrain autoradiography was completed for each radiopharmaceutical and [18F]FGln pharmacokinetics were studied by injecting 40 MBq into healthy BDIX rats (n = 10) and collecting blood samples between 5 and 60 min. Erythrocyte uptake, plasma protein binding and plasma parent-fraction were combined to estimate the total blood bioavailability of [18F]FGln over time. The corrected PET-image blood data was then applied to multiple pharmacokinetic models.

Results: Average BT4C tumor-to-healthy brain tissue uptake ratios (TBR) for PET images reached maxima of: [18F]FGln TBR: 1.99 ± 0.19 (n = 13), [18F]FDG TBR: 1.41 ± 0.11 (n = 6), and [11C]Met TBR: 1.08 ± 0.08, (n = 12) for the dynamic PET images. Pharmacokinetic modeling in dynamic [18F]FGln studies suggested both reversible and irreversible uptake play a similar role. Imaging with Inveon and Molecubes yielded similar end-result ratios with insignificant differences (p > 0.25).

Conclusions: In orthotopic BT4C gliomas, [18F]FGln may offer improved imagingversus[11C]Met and [18F]FDG. No significant difference in normalized end-result data was found between the Inveon and Molecubes camera systems. Kinetic modelling of [18F]FGln uptake suggests that both reversible and irreversible uptake play an important role in BDIX rat pharmacokinetics.

ABSTRACT:
This paper reports on the synthesis and structure elucidation of track-etched membranes (TeMs) with electrolessly deposited copper microtubes (prepared in etched-only and oxidized polyethylene terephthalate (PET) TeMs), as well as on the comparative testing of arsenic (III) ion removal capacities through bath adsorption experiments. The structure and composition of composites were investigated by X-ray diffraction technique and scanning electron and atomic force microscopies. It was determined that adsorption followed pseudo-second-order kinetics, and the adsorption rate constants were calculated. A comparative study of the applicability of the adsorption models of Langmuir, Freundlich, and Dubinin-Radushkevich was carried out in order to describe the experimental isotherms of the prepared composite TeMs. The constants and parameters of all of the above equations were determined. By comparing the regression coefficients R2, it was shown that the Freundlich model describes the experimental data on the adsorption of arsenic through the studied samples better than others. Free energy of As(III) adsorption on the samples was determined using the Dubinin-Radushkevich isotherm model and was found to be 17.2 and 31.6 kJ/mol for Cu/PET and Cu/Ox_PET samples, respectively. The high EDr value observed for the Cu/Ox_PET composite indicates that the interaction between the adsorbate and the composite is based on chemisorption.

TITLE: Synthesis and Characterization of [18F]JNJ-46356479 as the First 18F-Labeled PET Imaging Ligand for Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor 2

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Metabotropic glutamate receptor 2 (mGluR2) has been implicated in various psychiatric and neurological disorders, such as schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease. We have previously developed [11C]7 as a PET radioligand for imaging mGluR2. Herein, [18F]JNJ-46356479 ([18F]8) was synthesized and characterized as the first18F-labeled mGluR2 imaging ligand to enhance diagnostic approaches for mGluR2-related disorders.

Procedures: JNJ-46356479 (8) was radiolabeled via the copper (I)-mediated radiofluorination of organoborane 9. In vivo PET imaging experiments with [18F]8 were conducted first in C57BL/6 J mice and Sprague-Dawley rats to obtain whole body biodistribution and brain uptake profile. Subsequent PET studies were done in a cynomolgus monkey (Macaca fascicularis) to investigate the uptake of [18F]8 in the brain, its metabolic stability, as well as pharmacokinetic properties.

Results: JNJ-46356479 (8) exhibited excellent selectivity against other mGluRs. In vivo PET imaging studies showed reversible and specific binding characteristic of [18F]8 in rodents. In the non-human primate, [18F]8 displayed good in vivo metabolic stability, excellent brain permeability, fast and reversible kinetics with moderate heterogeneity across brain regions. Pre-treatment studies with compound 7 revealed time-dependent decrease of [18F]8 accumulation in mGluR2 rich regions based on SUV values with the highest decrease in the nucleus accumbens (18.7 ± 5.9%) followed by the cerebellum (18.0 ± 7.9%), the parietal cortex (16.9 ± 7.8%), and the hippocampus (16.8 ± 6.9%), similar to results obtained in the rat studies. However, the volume of distribution (VT) results derived from 2T4k model showed enhanced VTfrom a blocking study with compound 7. This is probably because of the potentiating effect of compound 7 as an mGluR2 PAM as well as related non-specific binding in the tissue data.

Conclusions: [18F]8 readily crosses the blood-brain barrier and demonstrates fast and reversible kinetics both in rodents and in a non-human primate. Further investigation of [18F]8 on its binding specificity would warrant translational study in human.

TITLE: In vivo imaging of synaptic density with [11C]UCB-J PET in two mouse models of neurodegenerative disease

AUTHORS: Mengfei Xiong, Sahar Roshanbin, Johanna Rokka, Eva Schlein, Martin Ingelsson, Dag Sehlin, Jonas Eriksson, Stina Syvänen

JOURNAL: NeuroImage

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
The positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand [11C]UCB-J binds to synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A) and is used to investigate synaptic density in the living brain. Clinical studies have indicated reduced [11C]UCB-J binding in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) brains compared to healthy controls. Still, it is unknown whether [11C]UCB-J PET can visualise synaptic loss in mouse models of these disorders. Such models are essential for understanding disease pathology and for evaluating the effects of novel disease-modifying drug candidates. In the present study, synaptic density in transgenic models of AD (ArcSwe) and PD (L61) was studied using [11C]UCB-J PET. Data were acquired during 60 min after injection, and time-activity curves (TACs) in different brain regions and the left ventricle of the heart were generated based on the dynamic PET images. The [11C]UCB-J brain concentrations were expressed as standardised uptake value (SUV) over time. The area under the SUV curve (AUC), the ratio of AUC in the brain to that in the heart (AUCbrain/blood), and the volume of distribution (VT) obtained by kinetic modelling using the heart TAC as input were compared between transgenic and age-matched wild type (WT) mice. The L61 mice displayed 11-13% lower AUCbrain/bloodratio and brain VTgenerated by kinetic modeling compared to the control WT mice. In general, also transgenic ArcSwe mice tended to show lower [11C]UCB-J brain exposure than age-matched WT controls, but variation within the different animal groups was high. Older WT mice (18-20 months) showed lower [11C]UCB-J brain exposure than younger WT mice (8-9 months). Together, these data imply that [11C]UCB-J PET reflects synaptic density in mouse models of neurodegeneration and that inter-subject variation is large. In addition, the study suggested that model-independent AUCbrain/bloodratio can be used to evaluate [11C]UCB-J binding as an alternative to full pharmacokinetic modelling.

TITLE: InVitro and In Vivo Investigation of S1PR1 Expression in the Central Nervous System Using [3H]CS1P1 and [11C]CS1P1

AUTHORS: Hao Jiang, Sumit Joshi, Hui Liu, Syahir Mansor, Lin Qiu, Haiyang Zhao, Timothy Whitehead, Robert J Gropler, Gregory F Wu, Anne H Cross, Tammie L S Benzinger, Kooresh I Shoghi, Joel S Perlmutter, Zhude Tu

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1PR1) is ubiquitously expressed among all tissues and plays key roles in many physiological and cellular processes. In the central nervous system (CNS), S1PR1 is expressed in different types of cells including neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocyte precursor cells. S1PR1 has been recognized as a novel therapeutic target in multiple sclerosis and other diseases. We previously reported a promising S1PR1-specific radioligand, [11C]CS1P1 (previously named [11C]TZ3321), which is under clinical investigation for human use. In the current study, we performed a detailed characterization of [3H]CS1P1 for its binding specificity to S1PR1 in CNS using autoradiography and immunohistochemistry in human and rat CNS tissues. Our data indicate that [3H]CS1P1 binds to S1PR1 in human frontal cortex tissue with aKdof 3.98 nM and aBmaxof 172.5 nM. The distribution of [3H]CS1P1 in human and rat CNS tissues is consistent with the distribution of S1PR1 detected by immunohistochemistry studies. Our microPET studies of [11C]CS1P1 in a nonhuman primate (NHP) show a standardized uptake value of 2.4 in the NHP brain, with test-retest variability of 0.23% among six different NHPs. Radiometabolite analysis in the plasma samples of NHP and rat, as well as in rat brain samples, showed that [11C]CS1P1 was stablein vivo. Kinetic modeling studies using a two-compartment tissue model showed that the positron emission tomography (PET) data fit the model well. Overall, our study provides a detailed characterization of [3H]CS1P1 binding to S1PR1 in the CNS. Combined with our microPET studies in the NHP brain, our data suggest that [11C]CS1P1 is a promising radioligand for PET imaging of S1PR1 in the CNS.

TITLE: 66Ga-PET-imaging of GRPR-expression in prostate cancer: production and characterization of [66Ga]Ga-NOTA-PEG2-RM26

AUTHORS: Sara S Rinne, Ayman Abouzayed, Katherine Gagnon, Vladimir Tolmachev, Anna Orlova

JOURNAL: Scientific reports

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Molecular imaging of the gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR) could improve patient management in prostate cancer. This study aimed to produce gallium-66 (T½= 9.5 h) suitable for radiolabeling, and investigate the imaging properties of gallium-66 labeled GRPR-antagonist NOTA-PEG2-RM26 for later-time point PET-imaging of GRPR expression. Gallium-66 was cyclotron-produced using a liquid target, and enriched [66Zn]Zn(NO3)2. In vitro, [66Ga]Ga-NOTA-PEG2-RM26 was characterized in GRPR-expressing PC-3 prostate cancer cells. In vivo, specificity test and biodistribution studies were performed 3 h and 22 h pi in PC-3 xenografted mice. microPET/MR was performed 3 h and 22 h pi. Biodistribution of [66Ga]Ga-NOTA-PEG2-RM26 was compared with [68Ga]Ga-NOTA-PEG2-RM26 3 h pi. [66Ga]Ga-NOTA-PEG2-RM26 was successfully prepared with preserved binding specificity and high affinity towards GRPR. [66Ga]Ga-NOTA-PEG2-RM26 cleared rapidly from blood via kidneys. Tumor uptake was GRPR-specific and exceeded normal organ uptake. Normal tissue clearance was limited, resulting in no improvement of tumor-to-organ ratios with time. Tumors could be clearly visualized using microPET/MR. Gallium-66 was successfully produced and [66Ga]Ga-NOTA-PEG2-RM26 was able to clearly visualize GRPR-expression both shortly after injection and on the next day using PET. However, delayed imaging did not improve contrast for Ga-labeled NOTA-PEG2-RM26.

JOURNAL: Clinical nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Introduction: The aim of this study was to study the feasibility of a fully integrated multiparametric imaging framework to characterize non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) at 3-T PET/MRI.

Patients and methods: An 18F-FDG PET/MRI multiparametric imaging framework was developed and prospectively applied to 11 biopsy-proven NSCLC patients. For each tumor, 12 parametric maps were generated, including PET full kinetic modeling, apparent diffusion coefficient, T1/T2 relaxation times, and DCE full kinetic modeling. Gaussian mixture model-based clustering was applied at the whole data set level to define supervoxels of similar multidimensional PET/MRI behaviors. Taking the multidimensional voxel behaviors as input and the supervoxel class as output, machine learning procedure was finally trained and validated voxelwise to reveal the dominant PET/MRI characteristics of these supervoxels at the whole data set and individual tumor levels.

Results: The Gaussian mixture model-based clustering clustering applied at the whole data set level (17,316 voxels) found 3 main multidimensional behaviors underpinned by the 12 PET/MRI quantitative parameters. Four dominant PET/MRI parameters of clinical relevance (PET: k2, k3 and DCE: ve, vp) predicted the overall supervoxel behavior with 97% of accuracy (SD, 0.7; 10-fold cross-validation). At the individual tumor level, these dimensionality-reduced supervoxel maps showed mean discrepancy of 16.7% compared with the original ones.

Conclusions: One-stop-shop PET/MRI multiparametric quantitative analysis of NSCLC is clinically feasible. Both PET and MRI parameters are useful to characterize the behavior of tumors at the supervoxel level. In the era of precision medicine, the full capabilities of PET/MRI would give further insight of the characterization of NSCLC behavior, opening new avenues toward image-based personalized medicine in this field.

TITLE: Improved precision of SPECT myocardial blood flow using a net tracer retention model

AUTHORS: Sarah G Cuddy-Walsh, Robert A deKemp, Terrence D Ruddy, R Glenn Wells

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Background: Noninvasive quantification of absolute myocardial blood flow (MBF) and myocardial flow reserve (MFR) provides incremental benefit to relative myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) to diagnose and manage heart disease. MBF can be measured with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) but the uncertainty in the measured values is high. Standardization and optimization of protocols for SPECT MBF measurements will improve the consistency of this technique. One element of the processing protocol is the choice of kinetic model used to analyze the dynamic image series.

Purpose: This study evaluates if a net tracer retention model (RET) will provide a better fit to the acquired data and greater test-retest precision than a one-compartment model (1CM) for SPECT MBF, with (+MC) and without (-MC) manual motion correction.

Methods: Data from previously acquired rest-stress MBF studies (31 SPECT-PET and 30 SPECT-SPECT) were reprocessed ± MC. Rate constants (K1) were extracted using 1CM and RET, +/-MC, and compared pairwise with standard PET MBF measurements using cross-validation to obtain calibration parameters for converting SPECT rate constants to MBF and to assess the goodness-of-fit of the calibration curves. Precision (coefficient of variation of test re-test relative differences, COV) of flow measurements was computed for 1CM and RET ± MC using data from the repeated SPECT MBF studies.

Results: Both the RET model and MC improved the goodness-of-fit of the SPECT MBF calibration curves to PET. All models produced minimal bias compared with PET (mean bias < 0.6%). The SPECT-SPECT MBF COV significantly improved from 34% (1CM+MC) to 28% (RET+MC, P = 0.008).

Conclusion: The RET+MC model provides a better calibration of SPECT to PET and blood flow measurements with better precision than the 1CM, without loss of accuracy.

TITLE: A methodological investigation of healthy tissue, hepatocellular carcinoma, and other lesions with dynamic 68Ga-FAPI-04 PET/CT imaging

AUTHORS: Barbara Katharina Geist, Haiqun Xing, Jingnan Wang, Ximin Shi, Haitao Zhao, Marcus Hacker, Xinting Sang, Li Huo, Xiang Li

JOURNAL: EJNMMI physics

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Background: The study aimed to establish a68Ga-FAPI-04 kinetic model in hepatic lesions, to determine the potential role of kinetic parameters in the differentiation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) from non-HCC lesions.

Material and methods: Time activity curves (TACs) were extracted from seven HCC lesions and five non-HCC lesions obtained from68Ga-FAPI-04 dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) scans of eight patients. Three kinetic models were applied to the TACs, using image-derived hepatic artery and/or portal vein as input functions. The maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) was taken for the lesions, the hepatic artery, and for the portal veins-the mean SUV for all healthy regions. The optimum model was chosen after applying the Schwartz information criteria to the TACs, differences in model parameters between HCC, non-HCC lesions, and healthy tissue were evaluated with the ANOVA test.

Results: A reversible two-tissue compartment model using both the arterial as well as venous input function was most preferred and showed significant differences in the kinetic parameters VND, VT, and BPNDbetween HCC, non-HCC lesions, and healthy regions (p < 0.01).

Conclusion: Several model parameters derived from a two-tissue compartment kinetic model with two image-derived input function from vein and aorta and using SUVmaxallow a differentiation between HCC and non-HCC lesions, obtained from dynamically performed PET scans using FAPI.

TITLE: Validation of dynamic [18F]FE-PE2I PET for estimation of relative regional cerebral blood flow: a comparison with [15O]H2O PET

AUTHORS: Susanna Jakobson Mo, Jan Axelsson, Lars Stiernman, Katrine Riklund

JOURNAL: EJNMMI research

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Background: Dopamine transporter (DAT) imaging is used in the diagnostic work-up in suspected parkinsonian syndromes and dementia with Lewy bodies but cannot differentiate between these syndromes, and an extra brain imaging examination of the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) or glucose metabolism is often needed for differential diagnosis. The requirement of two different imaging examinations is resource-consuming and inconvenient for the patients. Therefore, imaging of both cortical blood flow and DAT imaging with the same radiotracer would be more convenient and cost-effective. The aim of this study was to test whether relative regional cerebral blood flow (rCBFR) can be measured with the DAT-specific positron emission tomography (PET) tracer [18F]FE-PE2I (FE-PE2I), by validation with cerebral perfusion measured with [15O]H2O PET (H2O).

Methods: The rCBFRwas quantified by kinetic modeling for FE-PE2I (R1) and H2O (F). The R1 was calculated using the simplified reference tissue model, and F was calculated with a modified Koopman double-integration method. The linear relationship and intraclass correlation (ICC) between R1 and F were tested in image data derived from 29 patients with recent onset parkinsonism and 30 healthy controls.

Results: There was a strong linear correlation across all subjects between R1 and F in the frontal, parietal, temporal, cingulate and occipital cortex as well as in the striatum (r ≥ 0.731-0.905, p < 0.001) with a good-to-excellent ICC, ranging from 0.727 to 0.943 (p < 0.001).

Conclusions: Our results suggest that FE-PE2I may be used as a proxy for cerebral perfusion, thus potentially serving as a radiotracer for assessment of both DAT availability and rCBFRin one single dynamic scan. This could be valuable in the differential diagnosis of parkinsonian syndromes.

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Tracer kinetic modeling of tissue time activity curves and the individual input function based on arterial blood sampling and metabolite correction is the gold standard for quantitative characterization of microglia activation by PET with the translocator protein (TSPO) ligand18F-GE-180. This study tested simplified methods for quantification of18F-GE-180 PET.

Methods: Dynamic18F-GE-180 PET with arterial blood sampling and metabolite correction was performed in five healthy volunteers and 20 liver-transplanted patients. Population-based input function templates were generated by averaging individual input functions normalized to the total area under the input function using a leave-one-out approach. Individual population-based input functions were obtained by scaling the input function template with the individual parent activity concentration of18F-GE-180 in arterial plasma in a blood sample drawn at 27.5 min or by the individual administered tracer activity, respectively. The total18F-GE-180 distribution volume (VT) was estimated in 12 regions-of-interest (ROIs) by the invasive Logan plot using the measured or the population-based input functions. Late ROI-to-whole-blood and ROI-to-cerebellum ratio were also computed.

Results: Correlation with the reference VT(with individually measured input function) was very high for VTwith the population-based input function scaled with the blood sample and for the ROI-to-whole-blood ratio (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.989 ± 0.006 and 0.970 ± 0.005). The correlation was only moderate for VTwith the population-based input function scaled with tracer activity dose and for the ROI-to-cerebellum ratio (0.653 ± 0.074 and 0.384 ± 0.177). Reference VT, population-based VTwith scaling by the blood sample, and ROI-to-whole-blood ratio were sensitive to the TSPO gene polymorphism. Population-based VTwith scaling to the administered tracer activity and the ROI-to-cerebellum ratio failed to detect a polymorphism effect.

Conclusion: These results support the use of a population-based input function scaled with a single blood sample or the ROI-to-whole-blood ratio at a late time point for simplified quantitative analysis of18F-GE-180 PET.

TITLE: Region- and voxel-based quantification in human brain of [18F]LSN3316612, a radioligand for O-GlcNAcase

AUTHORS: Jae-Hoon Lee, Mattia Veronese, Jeih-San Liow, Cheryl L Morse, Jose A Montero Santamaria, Mohammad B Haskali, Sami S Zoghbi, Victor W Pike, Robert B Innis, Paolo Zanotti-Fregonara

JOURNAL: EJNMMI research

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Background: Previous studies found that the positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand [18F]LSN3316612 accurately quantified O-GlcNAcase in human brain using a two-tissue compartment model (2TCM). This study sought to assess kinetic model(s) as an alternative to 2TCM for quantifying [18F]LSN3316612 binding, particularly in order to generate good-quality parametric images.

Methods: The current study reanalyzed data from a previous study of 10 healthy volunteers who underwent both test and retest PET scans with [18F]LSN3316612. Kinetic analysis was performed at the region level with 2TCM using 120-min PET data and arterial input function, which was considered as the gold standard. Quantification was then obtained at both the region and voxel levels using Logan plot, Ichise's multilinear analysis-1 (MA1), standard spectral analysis (SA), and impulse response function at 120 min (IRF120). To avoid arterial sampling, a noninvasive relative quantification (standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR)) was also tested using the corpus callosum as a pseudo-reference region. Venous samples were also assessed to see whether they could substitute for arterial ones.

Results: Logan and MA1 generated parametric images of good visual quality and their total distribution volume (VT) values at both the region and voxel levels were strongly correlated with 2TCM-derived VT(r = 0.96-0.99) and showed little bias (up to - 8%). SA was more weakly correlated to 2TCM-derived VT(r = 0.93-0.98) and was more biased (~ 16%). IRF120showed a strong correlation with 2TCM-derived VT(r = 0.96) but generated noisier parametric images. All techniques were comparable to 2TCM in terms of test-retest variability and reliability except IRF120, which gave significantly worse results. Noninvasive SUVR values were not correlated with 2TCM-derived VT, and arteriovenous equilibrium was never reached.

Conclusions: Compared to SA and IRF, Logan and MA1 are more suitable alternatives to 2TCM for quantifying [18F]LSN3316612 and generating good-quality parametric images.

TITLE: Functional FDG-PET: Measurement of Task Related Neural Activity in Humans-A Compartment Model Approach and Comparison to fMRI

AUTHORS: Saga Steinmann Madsen, Svend Hvidsten, Thomas Lund Andersen

JOURNAL: Diagnostics (Basel, Switzerland)

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Neuroimaging holds an essential position in global healthcare, as brain-related disorders are a substantial and growing burden. Non-degenerative disorders such as stress, depression and anxiety share common function related traits of diffuse and fluctuating changes, such as change in brain-based functions of mood, behavior and cognitive abilities, where underlying physiological mechanism remain unresolved. In this study we developed a novel application for studying intra-subject task-activated brain function by the quantitative physiological measurement of the change in glucose metabolism in a single scan setup. Data were acquired on a PET/MR-scanner. We implemented a functional [18F]-FDG PET-scan with double boli-tracer administration and finger-tapping activation, as proof-of-concept, in five healthy participants. The [18F]-FDG data were analyzed using a two-tissue compartment double boli kinetic model with an image-derived input function. For stand-alone visual reference, blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) functional MRI (fMRI) was acquired in the same session and analyzed separately. We were able to measure the cerebral glucose metabolic rate during baseline as well as activation. Results showed increased glucose metabolic rate during activation by 36.3-87.9% mean 62.0%, locally in the peak seed region of M1 in the brain, on an intra-subject level, as well as very good spatial accuracy on group level, and localization compared to the BOLD fMRI result at subject and group level. Our novel method successfully determined the relative increase in the cerebral metabolic rate of glucose on a voxel level with good visual association to fMRI at the subject-level, holding promise for future individual clinical application. This approach will be easily adapted in future clinical perspectives and pharmacological interventions studies.

TITLE: Investigation of the Adsorption of Sulfamethoxazole by Degradable Microplastics Artificially Aged by Chemical Oxidation

AUTHORS: Fanxing Kong, Xia Xu, Yingang Xue, Yu Gao, Ling Zhang, Liping Wang, Shanqing Jiang, Qiuya Zhang

JOURNAL: Archives of environmental contamination and toxicology

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
In this study, three different types of microplastics were aged by the thermal activation K2S2O8method to investigate the adsorption behavior for sulfamethoxazole (SMX) in aqueous solution. The effects of pH, salinity and humic acid (HA) on adsorption behavior were also investigated. At the same time, the morphology and functional groups of microplastics before and after adsorption were characterized. As the aging time increased, the adsorption capacity of the microplastics also increased significantly. Whether it was pristine or aged, polylactic acid (PLA) had the highest adsorption capacity. The adsorption capacity of microplastics was the largest under acidic conditions, and its adsorption capacity decreased significantly in alkaline solutions. The presence of salinity inhibited the adsorption of SMX on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and PP, but the adsorption capacity of PLA increases when salinity was above 10‰. The adsorption of SMX on microplastics was promoted by HA. When the concentration of HA was 20 mg/L, the adsorption capacity of PLA and PET decreased. Kinetic and isotherm fits were applied to the adsorption process. The increase in sorption capacity was related to the development of holes and cracks and the enhanced number of surface oxygen-containing functional groups. The adsorption kinetics to pristine microplastics conformed to a pseudo-first-order kinetic model, while the kinetics of the aged microplastics conformed to a pseudo-second-order kinetic model. It implies that the adsorption of SMX by aging microplastics involves multiple processes. The adsorption isothermal adsorption process of SMX by microplastics accorded with Freundlich model, belonging to multi-layer adsorption.

ABSTRACT:
Adenosine A2Aand dopamine D2receptors in the basal ganglia form heterotetrameric structures that are involved in the regulation of motor activity and neuropsychiatric functions. The present study examines the A2Areceptor-mediated modulation of D2receptor binding in vivo using positron emission tomography (PET) with the D2antagonist tracer [11C]raclopride. Healthy male Wistar rats (n= 8) were scanned (60 min dynamic scan) with [11C]raclopride at baseline and 7 days later following an acute administration of the A2Aagonist CGS21680 (1 mg/kg), using a MicroPET Focus-220 camera. Nondisplaceable binding potential (BPND) values were calculated using a simplified reference tissue model (SRTM), with cerebellum as the reference tissue. SRTM analysis did not show any significant changes in [11C]raclopride BPND(p= 0.102) in striatum after CGS21680 administration compared to the baseline. As CGS21680 strongly affects hemodynamics, we also used arterial blood sampling and a metabolite-corrected plasma input function for compartment modeling using the reversible two-tissue compartment model (2TCM) to obtain the BPNDfrom thek3/k4ratio and from the striatum/cerebellum volume of distribution ratio (DVR) in a second group of animals. These rats underwent dynamic [11C]raclopride scans after pretreatment with a vehicle (n= 5), a single dose of CGS21680 (1 mg/kg,n= 5), or a single dose of the A2Aantagonist KW6002 (1 mg/kg,n= 5). The parent fraction in plasma was significantly higher in the CGS21680-treated group (p= 0.0001) compared to the vehicle-treated group. GCS21680 administration significantly reduced the striatalk3/k4ratio (p< 0.01), butk3andk4estimates may be less reliable. The BPND(DVR-1) decreased from 1.963 ± 0.27 in the vehicle-treated group to 1.53 ± 0.55 (p= 0.080) or 1.961 ± 0.11 (p= 0.993) after the administration of CGS21680 or KW6002, respectively. Our study suggests that the A2Aagonist CGS21680, but not the antagonist KW6002, may reduce the D2receptor availability in the striatum.

TITLE: Can Internal Carotid Arteries Be Used for Noninvasive Quantification of Brain PET Studies?

AUTHORS: Laura Providência, Chris W J van der Weijden, Philipp Mohr, Joyce van Sluis, Johannes H van Snick, Riemer H J A Slart, Rudi A J O Dierckx, Adriaan A Lammertsma, Charalampos Tsoumpas

ABSTRACT:
Because of the limited axial field of view of conventional PET scanners, the internal carotid arteries are commonly used to obtain an image-derived input function (IDIF) in quantitative brain PET. However, time-activity curves extracted from the internal carotids are prone to partial-volume effects due to the limited PET resolution. This study aimed to assess the use of the internal carotids for quantifying brain glucose metabolism before and after partial-volume correction.Methods:Dynamic [18F]FDG images were acquired on a 106-cm-long PET scanner, and quantification was performed with a 2-tissue-compartment model and Patlak analysis using an IDIF extracted from the internal carotids. An IDIF extracted from the ascending aorta was used as ground truth.Results:The internal carotid IDIF underestimated the area under the curve by 37% compared with the ascending aorta IDIF, leading tovalues approximately 17% higher. After partial-volume correction, the mean relativedifferences calculated with the ascending aorta and internal carotid IDIFs dropped to 7.5% and 0.05%, when using a 2-tissue-compartment model and Patlak analysis, respectively. However, microparameters (K1,k2,k3) derived from the corrected internal carotid curve differed significantly from those obtained using the ascending aorta.Conclusion:These results suggest that partial-volume-corrected internal carotids may be used to estimatebut not kinetic microparameters. Further validation in a larger patient cohort with more variable kinetics is needed for more definitive conclusions.

TITLE: Functional 4-D clustering for characterizing intratumor heterogeneity in dynamic imaging: evaluation in FDG PET as a prognostic biomarker for breast cancer

AUTHORS: Rhea Chitalia, Varsha Viswanath, Austin R Pantel, Lanell M Peterson, Aimilia Gastounioti, Eric A Cohen, Mark Muzi, Joel Karp, David A Mankoff, Despina Kontos

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Probe-based dynamic (4-D) imaging modalities capture breast intratumor heterogeneity both spatially and kinetically. Characterizing heterogeneity through tumor sub-populations with distinct functional behavior may elucidate tumor biology to improve targeted therapy specificity and enable precision clinical decision making.

Methods: We propose an unsupervised clustering algorithm for 4-D imaging that integrates Markov-Random Field (MRF) image segmentation with time-series analysis to characterize kinetic intratumor heterogeneity. We applied this to dynamic FDG PET scans by identifying distinct time-activity curve (TAC) profiles with spatial proximity constraints. We first evaluated algorithm performance using simulated dynamic data. We then applied our algorithm to a dataset of 50 women with locally advanced breast cancer imaged by dynamic FDG PET prior to treatment and followed to monitor for disease recurrence. A functional tumor heterogeneity (FTH) signature was then extracted from functionally distinct sub-regions within each tumor. Cross-validated time-to-event analysis was performed to assess the prognostic value of FTH signatures compared to established histopathological and kinetic prognostic markers.

Results: Adding FTH signatures to a baseline model of known predictors of disease recurrence and established FDG PET uptake and kinetic markers improved the concordance statistic (C-statistic) from 0.59 to 0.74 (p = 0.005). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the FTH signatures identified two significant (p < 0.001) phenotypes of tumor heterogeneity corresponding to high and low FTH. Distributions of FDG flux, or Ki, were significantly different (p = 0.04) across the two phenotypes.

Conclusions: Our findings suggest that imaging markers of FTH add independent value beyond standard PET imaging metrics in predicting recurrence-free survival in breast cancer and thus merit further study.

TITLE: Earthworms' Degradable Bioplastic Diet of Polylactic Acid: Easy to Break Down and Slow to Excrete

AUTHORS: Lei Wang, Yawen Peng, Yali Xu, Junjie Zhang, Chunguang Liu, Xuejiao Tang, Yuan Lu, Hongwen Sun

JOURNAL: Environmental science & technology

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Microplastics (MPs) in soils may be ingested by terrestrial animals. While the application of bioplastics is increasing, the ingestion and excretion characteristics of bio-MPs by terrestrial animals are poorly understood as compared to fossil-MPs. Here, the approach-avoidance behavior of adult earthwormsEisenia fetidato MP-contaminated soil was assessed. Fossil-based poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) and bio-based poly(lactic acid) (PLA) MPs were found to be preferred by the earthworms, which might be due to the odor of polymer monomers. MPs in earthworm casts were analyzed by microscopy counting and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The amount of microscopically recognizable excreted PET and PLA was 553 and 261 items/g, respectively, while a higher proportion of smaller PLA particles also presented. Bio-based PLA is much easy to break down by earthworms than fossil-based PET. Submicron and nanocron PLA accounted for 57 and 13% of the excreted PLA on the 10th day of excretion. MP excretion was well described with the first-order kinetic model, and the elimination half-life was 9.3 (for PET) and 45 h (for PLA). A longer excretion period of PLA may be related to its potential to break down in the earthworms' digestive tract. This not only promotes the environmental degradation of PLA but also suggests the ecological risk caused by nanoparticles.

TITLE: Choice of anesthesia and data analysis method strongly increases sensitivity of 18F-FDG PET imaging during experimental epileptogenesis

AUTHORS: Ina Jahreis, Pablo Bascuñana, Tobias L Ross, Jens P Bankstahl, Marion Bankstahl

JOURNAL: PloS one

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Alterations in brain glucose metabolism detected by 2-deoxy-2-[18F]-fluoro-D-glucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) may serve as an early predictive biomarker and treatment target for epileptogenesis. Here, we aimed to investigate changes in cerebral glucose metabolism before induction of epileptogenesis, during epileptogenesis as well as during chronic epilepsy. As anesthesia is usually unavoidable for preclinical PET imaging and influences the distribution of the radiotracer, four different protocols were compared.

Procedures: We investigated 18F-FDG uptake phase in conscious rats followed by a static scan as well as dynamic scans under continuous isoflurane, medetomidine-midazolam-fentanyl (MMF), or propofol anesthesia. Furthermore, we applied different analysis approaches: atlas-based regional analysis, statistical parametric mapping, and kinetic analysis.

Results: At baseline and compared to uptake in conscious rats, isoflurane and propofol anesthesia resulted in decreased cortical 18F-FDG uptake while MMF anesthesia led to a globally decreased tracer uptake. During epileptogenesis, MMF anesthesia was clearly best distinctive for visualization of prominently increased glucometabolism in epilepsy-related brain areas. Kinetic modeling further increased sensitivity, particularly for continuous isoflurane anesthesia. During chronic epilepsy, hypometabolism affecting more or less the whole brain was detectable with all protocols.

Conclusion: This study reveals evaluation of anesthesia protocols for preclinical 18F-FDG PET imaging as a critical step in the study design. Together with an appropriate data analysis workflow, the chosen anesthesia protocol may uncover otherwise concealed disease-associated regional glucometabolic changes.

TITLE: Posterior estimation using deep learning: a simulation study of compartmental modeling in dynamic positron emission tomography

AUTHORS: Xiaofeng Liu, Thibault Marin, Tiss Amal, Jonghye Woo, Georges El Fakhri, Jinsong Ouyang

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Background: In medical imaging, images are usually treated as deterministic, while their uncertainties are largely underexplored.

Purpose: This work aims at using deep learning to efficiently estimate posterior distributions of imaging parameters, which in turn can be used to derive the most probable parameters as well as their uncertainties.

Methods: Our deep learning-based approaches are based on a variational Bayesian inference framework, which is implemented using two different deep neural networks based on conditional variational auto-encoder (CVAE), CVAE-dual-encoder, and CVAE-dual-decoder. The conventional CVAE framework, that is, CVAE-vanilla, can be regarded as a simplified case of these two neural networks. We applied these approaches to a simulation study of dynamic brain PET imaging using a reference region-based kinetic model.

Results: In the simulation study, we estimated posterior distributions of PET kinetic parameters given a measurement of the time-activity curve. Our proposed CVAE-dual-encoder and CVAE-dual-decoder yield results that are in good agreement with the asymptotically unbiased posterior distributions sampled by Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). The CVAE-vanilla can also be used for estimating posterior distributions, although it has an inferior performance to both CVAE-dual-encoder and CVAE-dual-decoder.

Conclusions: We have evaluated the performance of our deep learning approaches for estimating posterior distributions in dynamic brain PET. Our deep learning approaches yield posterior distributions, which are in good agreement with unbiased distributions estimated by MCMC. All these neural networks have different characteristics and can be chosen by the user for specific applications. The proposed methods are general and can be adapted to other problems.

TITLE: Dual-time-point dynamic 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT for parametric imaging generation in prostate cancer

AUTHORS: Paphawarin Burasothikul, Chatchai Navikhacheevin, Panya Pasawang, Tanawat Sontrapornpol, Chanan Sukprakun, Kitiwat Khamwan

JOURNAL: Annals of nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: To investigate the optimal dual-time-point (DTP) approaches using dynamic68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT imaging to generate parametric images for prostate cancer patients.

Methods: Fifteen patients with prostate cancer were intravenously administered68Ga-PSMA-11 of 181.9 ± 47.2 MBq, followed by an immediate 60 min dynamic PET/CT scan. List-mode data were reconstructed into 25 timeframes (6 × 10 s, 8 × 30 s, and 11 × 300 s) and corrected for motion and partial volume effect. DTP parametric images were generated using different interval time points of 5 min and 10 min, with a minimum of 30 min time interval. Net influx rates (Ki) were calculated through the fitting of a single irreversible two-tissue compartmental model. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) values between DTP protocols and 60 min Kiwere obtained. Lesion-to-background ratios (LBRs) of Kiand standardized uptake value (SUV) images in each DTP protocol were determined.

Results: The DTP protocol of 5-10 min with a 40-45 min interval showed the highest ICC of 0.988 compared with the 60 min Ki, whereas the ICC values for the intervals of 0-5 min with 55-60 min and 0-10 min with 50-60 min were 0.941. The LBRs of the 60 min Ki, 5-10 min with 40-45 min Ki, 0-5 min with 55-60 min Ki, 0-10 min with 50-60 min Ki, SUVmean, and SUVmaximages were 29.53 ± 27.33, 13.05 ± 15.28, 45.15 ± 53.11, 45.52 ± 70.31, 19.77 ± 23.43, and 25.06 ± 30.07, respectively.

Conclusion: The 0-5 min with 55-60 min DTP parametric imaging exhibits a comparable Kito 60 min parametric imaging and remarkable image quality and contrast than SUV imaging, enhancing prostate cancer diagnosis while maintaining time efficiency.

TITLE: Non-Invasive Quantification of the Brain [¹⁸F]FDG-PET Using Inferred Blood Input Function Learned From Total-Body Data With Physical Constraint

JOURNAL: IEEE transactions on medical imaging

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Full quantification of brain PET requires the blood input function (IF), which is traditionally achieved through an invasive and time-consuming arterial catheter procedure, making it unfeasible for clinical routine. This study presents a deep learning based method to estimate the input function (DLIF) for a dynamic brain FDG scan. A long short-term memory combined with a fully connected network was used. The dataset for training was generated from 85 total-body dynamic scans obtained on a uEXPLORER scanner. Time-activity curves from 8 brain regions and the carotid served as the input of the model, and labelled IF was generated from the ascending aorta defined on CT image. We emphasize the goodness-of-fitting of kinetic modeling as an additional physical loss to reduce the bias and the need for large training samples. DLIF was evaluated together with existing methods in terms of RMSE, area under the curve, regional and parametric image quantifications. The results revealed that the proposed model can generate IFs that closer to the reference ones in terms of shape and amplitude compared with the IFs generated using existing methods. All regional kinetic parameters calculated using DLIF agreed with reference values, with the correlation coefficient being 0.961 (0.913) and relative bias being 1.68±8.74% (0.37±4.93%) for [Formula: see text] ( [Formula: see text]. In terms of the visual appearance and quantification, parametric images were also highly identical to the reference images. In conclusion, our experiments indicate that a trained model can infer an image-derived IF from dynamic brain PET data, which enables subsequent reliable kinetic modeling.

ABSTRACT:
PEGylation is routinely used to extend the systemic circulation of various protein therapeutics and nanomedicines. Nonetheless, mounting evidence is emerging that individuals exposed to select PEGylated therapeutics can develop antibodies specific to PEG, i.e., anti-PEG antibodies (APA). In turn, APA increase both the risk of hypersensitivity to the drug as well as potential loss of efficacy due to accelerated blood clearance of the drug. Despite the broad implications of APA, the timescales and systemic specificity by which APA can alter the pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of PEGylated drugs remain not well understood. Here, we developed a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model designed to resolve APA's impact on both early- and late-phase pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of intravenously administered PEGylated drugs. Our model accurately recapitulates PK and biodistribution data obtained from PET/CT imaging of radiolabeled PEG-liposomes and PEG-uricase in mice with and without APA, as well as serum levels of PEG-uricase in humans. Our work provides another illustration of the power of high-resolution PBPK models for understanding the pharmacokinetic impacts of anti-drug antibodies and the dynamics with which antibodies can mediate clearance of foreign species.

TITLE: Enhanced Extraction of Blood and Tissue Time-Activity Curves in Cardiac Mouse FDG PET Imaging by Means of Constrained Nonnegative Matrix Factorization

AUTHORS: Otman Sarrhini, Pedro D'Orléans-Juste, Jacques A Rousseau, Jean-François Beaudoin, Roger Lecomte

JOURNAL: International journal of biomedical imaging

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
We propose an enhanced method to accurately retrieve time-activity curves (TACs) of blood and tissue from dynamic 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose ([18F]FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) cardiac images of mice. The method is noninvasive and consists of using a constrained nonnegative matrix factorization algorithm (CNMF) applied to the matrix (A) containing the intensity values of the voxels of the left ventricle (LV) PET image. CNMF factorizesAinto nonnegative matricesHandW, respectively, representing the physiological factors (blood and tissue) and their associated weights, by minimizing an extended cost function. We verified our method on 32 C57BL/6 mice, 14 of them with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). With CNMF, we could break down the mouse LV into myocardial and blood pool images. Their corresponding TACs were used in kinetic modeling to readily determine the [18F]FDG influx constant (Ki) required to compute the myocardial metabolic rate of glucose. The calculatedKivalues using CNMF for the heart of control mice were in good agreement with those published in the literature. Significant differences inKivalues for the heart of control and AMI mice were found using CNMF. The values of the elements ofWagreed well with the LV structural changes induced by ligation of the left coronary artery. CNMF was compared with the recently published method based on robust unmixing of dynamic sequences using regions of interest (RUDUR). A clear improvement of signal separation was observed with CNMF compared to the RUDUR method.

JOURNAL: Journal of microbiology and biotechnology

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Polyethylene terephthalate (PET), one of the most widely used plastics in the world, causes serious environmental problems. Recently, scientists have been focused on the enzymatic degradation of PET, an environmentally friendly method that offers an attractive approach to the degradation and recycling of PET. In this work, PET hydrolase fromStreptomycessp. W2061 was biochemically characterized, and the biodegradation of PET was performed using the PET model substrate bis (2-hydroxyethyl terephthalate) (BHET). PET hydrolase has an isoelectric point of 5.84, and a molecular mass of about 50.31 kDa. The optimum pH and temperature were 7.0 and 40°C, respectively. LC-MS analysis of the enzymatic products showed that the PET hydrolase successfully degraded a single ester bond of BHET, leading to the formation of MHET. Furthermore, in silico characterization of the PET hydrolase protein sequence and its predicted three-dimensional structure was designed and compared with the well-characterized IsPETase fromIdeonella sakaiensis. The structural analysis showed that the (Gly-x1-Ser-x2-Gly) serine hydrolase motif and the catalytic triad (Ser, Asp, and His) were conserved in all sequences. In addition, we integrated molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to analyze the variation in the structural stability of the PET hydrolase in the absence and presence of BHET. These simulations showed the formation of a stable complex between the PET hydrolase and BHET. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study onStreptomycessp. W2061 to investigate the BHET degradation activity of PET hydrolase, which has potential application in the biodegradation of plastics in the environment.

TITLE: Evaluation of (2S,4S)-4-[18F]FEBGln as a Positron Emission Tomography Tracer for Tumor Imaging

AUTHORS: Yong Huang, Yajing Liu, Chengze Li, Zhongjing Li, Hualong Chen, Lu Zhang, Ying Liang, Zehui Wu

JOURNAL: Molecular pharmaceutics

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Glutamine metabolism-related tracers have the potential to visualize numerous tumors because glutamine is the second largest source of energy for tumors. (2S,4S)-4-[18F]FEBGln was designed by introducing [18F]fluoroethoxy benzyl on carbon-4 of glutamine. The aim of this study was to investigate the pharmacokinetic properties and tumor positron emission tomography (PET) imaging characteristics of (2S,4S)-4-[18F]FEBGln in detail. The biodistribution results of nude mice bearing MCF-7 tumor showed that (2S,4S)-4-[18F]FEBGln had high initial tumor uptake, and a fast clearance rate, resulting in a high tumor-to-muscle ratio at 30 min postinjection. There was no obvious defluorinationin vivo. The micro-PET-CT imaging results of (2S,4S)-4-[18F]FEBGln orthotopic MCF-7 tumor-bearing nude mice were consistent with the biological distribution results. Compared with (2S,4R)-4-[18F]FGln, (2S,4S)-4-[18F]FEBGln showed poor tumor retention, but its clearance in normal tissues was also fast, so it had better PET image contrast than the former. Unlike poor retention in MCF-7-bearing nude mice, (2S,4S)-4-[18F]FEBGln has good retention in NCI-h1975 and 22Rv1 tumor models. Since (2S,4S)-4-[18F]FEBGln has low uptake in normal lungs and high uptake in the bladder, it is expected to be used in the accurate diagnosis of lung cancer but cannot accurately determine prostate cancer. Consistent with the advantages of radiolabeled amino acids in the application of brain tumors, (2S,4S)-4-[18F]FEBGln accurately diagnoses U87MG glioma with higher contrast than [18F]FET and [18F]FDG, and there is a correlation between (2S,4S)-4-[18F]FEBGln uptake and tumor growth cycle. Further kinetic model analysis showed that (2S,4S)-4-[18F]FEBGln was similar to (2S,4R)-4-[18F]FGln, conforming to the one-compartment model and the Logan graphical model, and was expected to assess the size of the glutamine pool of the tumor. Therefore, (2S,4S)-4-[18F]FEBGln is expected to provide a strong imaging basis for the diagnosis, formulation of personalized plans, and efficacy evaluation of glioma, lung cancer, and breast cancer.

TITLE: Automated Quantitative Image-Derived Input Function for the Estimation of Cerebral Blood Flow Using Oxygen-15-Labelled Water on a Long-Axial Field-of-View PET/CT Scanner

AUTHORS: Thomas Lund Andersen, Flemming Littrup Andersen, Bryan Haddock, Sverre Rosenbaum, Henrik Bo Wiberg Larsson, Ian Law, Ulrich Lindberg

JOURNAL: Diagnostics (Basel, Switzerland)

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
The accurate estimation of the tracer arterial blood concentration is crucial for reliable quantitative kinetic analysis in PET. In the current work, we demonstrate the automatic extraction of an image-derived input function (IDIF) from a CT AI-based aorta segmentation subsequently resliced to a dynamic PET series acquired on a Siemens Vision Quadra long-axial field of view scanner in 10 human subjects scanned with [15O]H2O. We demonstrate that the extracted IDIF is quantitative and in excellent agreement with a delay- and dispersion-corrected sampled arterial input function (AIF). Perfusion maps in the brain are calculated and compared from the IDIF and AIF, respectively, showed a high degree of correlation. The results demonstrate the possibility of defining a quantitatively correct IDIF compared with AIFs from the new-generation high-sensitivity and high-time-resolution long-axial field-of-view PET/CT scanners.

JOURNAL: Neurological sciences : official journal of the Italian Neurological Society and of the Italian Society of Clinical Neurophysiology

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Background: Patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) may remain in a relapsing-remitting (RRMS) course despite long-standing disease, while others will develop secondary progression (SPMS). Chronic inflammation and changes in the blood-brain barrier resulting in perturbed glucose metabolism may account for these differences. PET-MRI with kinetic analysis of 2-deoxy-2(18 F)fluoro-d-glucose (18 F-FDG) provides insight into glucose metabolism and has proven useful in several chronic inflammatory diseases. However, to our knowledge, it has never been studied in MS.

Objective: To explore potential differences in glucose distribution kinetics among individuals with long-standing SPMS and RRMS using dynamic 18-F-FDG PET-MRI.

Methods: Dynamic 18-F-FDG PET-MRI scans were obtained in 11 patients with long-standing MS: 4 with RRMS and 7 with SPMS. Kinetic analysis of PET data was performed using a three-compartment model equation that represents plasma, tissue and 18 F-FDG phosphorylation. Individual rate constants of 18-F-FDG across the compartments were calculated.

Results: Patients with SPMS exhibited a trend towards an increased net influx rate of glucose (p = 0.059) and an increased rate constant representing glucose phosphorylation. Together, the data suggest increased uptake of glucose and glycolysis in these patients.

Conclusion: Dynamic 18 F-FDG PET-MRI is a feasible technique that may show information in vivo of glucose metabolism in MS. Although preliminary data suggest a potential radiological marker of progression in MS, further studies are required to confirm this hypothesis.

ABSTRACT:
The number of functionally active synapses provides a measure of neural integrity, with reductions observed in neurodegenerative disorders. [11C]UCB-J binds to synaptic vesicle 2A (SV2A) transmembrane protein located in secretory vesicles. We aimed to assess [11C]UCB-J PET as an in vivo biomarker of regional cerebral synaptic SV2A density in rat lesion models of neurodegeneration. Healthy anesthetized rats had [11C]UCB-J PET and arterial blood sampling. We compared different models describing [11C]UCB-J brain uptake kinetics to determine its regional distribution. Blocking studies were performed with levetiracetam (LEV), an antiepileptic SV2A antagonist. Tracer binding was measured in rodent unilateral acute lesion models of Parkinsonism and Huntington's disease, induced with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) and quinolinic acid (QA), respectively. [3H]UCB-J autoradiography was performed in postmortem tissue. Rat brain showed high and fast [11C]UCB-J uptake and washout with up to 80% blockade by LEV. [11C]UCB-J PET showed a 6.2% decrease in ipsilateral striatal SV2A binding after 6-OHDA and 39.3% and 55.1% decreases after moderate and high dose QA confirmed by autoradiography. In conclusion, [11C]UCB-J PET provides a good in vivo marker of synaptic SV2A density which can potentially be followed longitudinally along with synaptic responses to putative neuroprotective agents in models of neurodegeneration.

TITLE: Automated PET-RAFT Polymerization Towards Pharmaceutical Amorphous Solid Dispersion Development

AUTHORS: Rahul Upadhya, Ashish Punia, Mythili J Kanagala, Lina Liu, Matthew Lamm, Timothy A Rhodes, Adam J Gormley

JOURNAL: ACS applied polymer materials

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
In pharmaceutical oral drug delivery development, about 90% of drugs in the pipeline have poor aqueous solubility leading to severe challenges with oral bioavailability and translation to effective and safe drug products. Amorphous solid dispersions (ASDs) have been utilized to enhance the oral bioavailability of poorly soluble active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). However, a limited selection of regulatory-approved polymer excipients exists for the development and further understanding of tailor-made ASDs. Thus, a significant need exists to better understand how polymers can be designed to interact with specific API moieties. Here, we demonstrate how an automated combinatorial library approach can be applied to the synthesis and screening of polymer excipients for the model drug probucol. We synthesized a library of 25 random heteropolymers containing one hydrophilic monomer (2-hydroxypropyl acrylate (HPA)) and four hydrophobic monomers at varied incorporation. The performance of ASDs made by a rapid film casting method was evaluated by dissolution using ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) sampling at various time points. This combinatorial library and rapid screening strategy enabled us to identify a relationship between polymer hydrophobicity, monomer hydrophobic side group geometry, and API dissolution performance. Remarkably, the most effective synthesized polymers displayed slower drug release kinetics compared to industry standard polymer excipients, showing the ability to modulate the drug release profile. Future coupling of high throughput polymer synthesis, high throughput screening (HTS), and quantitative modeling would enable specification of designer polymer excipients for specific API functionalities.

TITLE: Quantification of aromatase binding in the female human brain using [11 C]cetrozole positron emission tomography

AUTHORS: My Jonasson, Patrik Nordeman, Jonas Eriksson, Helena Wilking, Johan Wikström, Kayo Takahashi, Takashi Niwa, Takamitsu Hosoya, Yasuyoshi Watanabe, Gunnar Antoni, Inger Sundström Poromaa, Mark Lubberink, Erika Comasco

ABSTRACT:
Aromatase, the enzyme that in the brain converts testosterone and androstenedione to estradiol and estrone, respectively, is a putative key factor in psychoneuroendocrinology. In vivo assessment of aromatase was performed to evaluate tracer kinetic models and optimal scan duration, for quantitative analysis of the aromatase positron emission tomography (PET) ligand [11C]cetrozole. Anatomical magnetic resonance and 90-min dynamic [11C]cetrozole PET-CT scans were performed on healthy women. Volume of interest (VOI)-based analyses with a plasma-input function were performed using the single-tissue and two-tissue (2TCM) reversible compartment models and plasma-input Logan analysis. Additionally, the simplified reference tissue model (SRTM), Logan reference tissue model (LRTM), and standardized uptake volume ratio model, with cerebellum as reference region, were evaluated. Parametric images were generated and regionally averaged voxel values were compared with VOI-based analyses of the reference tissue models. The optimal reference model was used for evaluation of a decreased scan duration. Differences between the plasma-input- and reference tissue-based methods and comparisons between scan durations were assessed by linear regression. The [11C]cetrozole time-activity curves were best described by the 2TCM. SRTM nondisplaceable binding potential (BPND), with cerebellum as reference region, can be used to estimate [11C]cetrozole binding and generated robust and quantitatively accurate results for a reduced scan duration of 60 min. Receptor parametric mapping, a basis function implementation of SRTM, as well as LRTM, produced quantitatively accurate parametric images, showing BPNDat the voxel level. As PET tracer, [11C]cetrozole can be employed for relatively short brain scans to measure aromatase binding using a reference tissue-based approach.

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: As several therapies aimed at lowering mutant huntingtin (mHTT) brain levels in Huntington's disease (HD) are currently being investigated, noninvasive positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of mHTT could be utilized to directly evaluate therapeutic efficacy and monitor disease progression. Here we characterized and longitudinally assessed the novel radioligand [11C]CHDI-626 for mHTT PET imaging in the zQ175DN mouse model of HD.

Methods: After evaluating radiometabolites and radioligand kinetics, we conducted longitudinal dynamic PET imaging at 3, 6, 9, and 13 months of age (M) in wild-type (WT, n = 17) and heterozygous (HET, n = 23) zQ175DN mice. Statistical analysis was performed to evaluate temporal and genotypic differences. Cross-sectional cohorts at each longitudinal time point were included for post-mortem [3H]CHDI-626 autoradiography.

Results: Despite fast metabolism and kinetics, the radioligand was suitable for PET imaging of mHTT. Longitudinal quantification could discriminate between genotypes already at premanifest stage (3 M), showing an age-associated increase in signal in HET mice in parallel with mHTT aggregate load progression, as supported by the post-mortem [3H]CHDI-626 autoradiography.

Conclusion: With clinical evaluation underway, [11C]CHDI-626 PET imaging appears to be a suitable preclinical candidate marker to monitor natural HD progression and for the evaluation of mHTT-lowering therapies.

TITLE: ParaPET: non-invasive deep learning method for direct parametric brain PET reconstruction using histoimages

AUTHORS: Rajat Vashistha, Hamed Moradi, Amanda Hammond, Kieran O'Brien, Axel Rominger, Hasan Sari, Kuangyu Shi, Viktor Vegh, David Reutens

JOURNAL: EJNMMI research

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Background: The indirect method for generating parametric images in positron emission tomography (PET) involves the acquisition and reconstruction of dynamic images and temporal modelling of tissue activity given a measured arterial input function. This approach is not robust, as noise in each dynamic image leads to a degradation in parameter estimation. Direct methods incorporate into the image reconstruction step both the kinetic and noise models, leading to improved parametric images. These methods require extensive computational time and large computing resources. Machine learning methods have demonstrated significant potential in overcoming these challenges. But they are limited by the requirement of a paired training dataset. A further challenge within the existing framework is the use of state-of-the-art arterial input function estimation via temporal arterial blood sampling, which is an invasive procedure, or an additional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan for selecting a region where arterial blood signal can be measured from the PET image. We propose a novel machine learning approach for reconstructing high-quality parametric brain images from histoimages produced from time-of-flight PET data without requiring invasive arterial sampling, an MRI scan, or paired training data from standard field-of-view scanners.

Result: The proposed is tested on a simulated phantom and five oncological subjects undergoing an 18F-FDG-PET scan of the brain using Siemens Biograph Vision Quadra. Kinetic parameters set in the brain phantom correlated strongly with the estimated parameters (K1, k2and k3, Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.91, 0.92 and 0.93) and a mean squared error of less than 0.0004. In addition, our method significantly outperforms (p < 0.05, paired t-test) the conventional nonlinear least squares method in terms of contrast-to-noise ratio. At last, the proposed method was found to be 37% faster than the conventional method.

Conclusion: We proposed a direct non-invasive DL-based reconstruction method and produced high-quality parametric maps of the brain. The use of histoimages holds promising potential for enhancing the estimation of parametric images, an area that has not been extensively explored thus far. The proposed method can be applied to subject-specific dynamic PET data alone.

TITLE: Performance evaluation of the Q.Clear reconstruction framework versus conventional reconstruction algorithms for quantitative brain PET-MR studies

AUTHORS: Daniela Ribeiro, William Hallett, Adriana A S Tavares

JOURNAL: EJNMMI physics

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Background: Q.Clear is a Bayesian penalized likelihood (BPL) reconstruction algorithm that presents improvements in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in clinical positron emission tomography (PET) scans. Brain studies in research require a reconstruction that provides a good spatial resolution and accentuates contrast features however, filtered back-projection (FBP) reconstruction is not available on GE SIGNA PET-Magnetic Resonance (PET-MR) and studies have been reconstructed with an ordered subset expectation maximization (OSEM) algorithm. This study aims to propose a strategy to approximate brain PET quantitative outcomes obtained from images reconstructed with Q.Clear versus traditional FBP and OSEM.

Methods: Contrast recovery and background variability were investigated with the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) Image Quality (IQ) phantom. Resolution, axial uniformity and SNR were investigated using the Hoffman phantom. Both phantoms were scanned on a Siemens Biograph 6 TruePoint PET-Computed Tomography (CT) and a General Electric SIGNA PET-MR, for FBP, OSEM and Q.Clear. Differences between the metrics obtained with Q.Clear with different β values and FBP obtained on the PET-CT were determined.

Results: For in plane and axial resolution, Q.Clear with low β values presented the best results, whereas for SNR Q.Clear with higher β gave the best results. The uniformity results are greatly impacted by the β value, where β < 600 can yield worse uniformity results compared with the FBP reconstruction.

Conclusion: This study shows that Q.Clear improves contrast recovery and provides better resolution and SNR, in comparison to OSEM, on the PET-MR. When using low β values, Q.Clear can provide similar results to the ones obtained with traditional FBP reconstruction, suggesting it can be used for quantitative brain PET kinetic modelling studies.

TITLE: Mapping 18F-FDG Kinetics Together with Patient-Specific Bootstrap Assessment of Uncertainties: An Illustration with Data from a PET/CT Scanner with a Long Axial Field of View

AUTHORS: Qi Wu, Fengyun Gu, Liam D O'Suilleabhain, Hasan Sari, Song Xue, Kuangyu Shi, Axel Rominger, Finbarr O'Sullivan

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
The purpose of this study was to examine a nonparametric approach to mapping kinetic parameters and their uncertainties with data from the emerging generation of dynamic whole-body PET/CT scanners.Methods:Dynamic PET18F-FDG data from a set of 24 cancer patients studied on a long-axial-field-of-view PET/CT scanner were considered. Kinetics were mapped using a nonparametric residue mapping (NPRM) technique. Uncertainties were evaluated using an image-based bootstrapping methodology. Kinetics and bootstrap-derived uncertainties are reported for voxels, maximum-intensity projections, and volumes of interest (VOIs) corresponding to several key organs and lesions. Comparisons between NPRM and standard 2-compartment (2C) modeling of VOI kinetics are carefully examined.Results:NPRM-generated kinetic maps were of good quality and well aligned with vascular and metabolic18F-FDG patterns, reasonable for the range of VOIs considered. On a single 3.2-GHz processor, the specification of the bootstrapping model took 140 min; individual bootstrap replicates required 80 min each. VOI time-course data were much more accurately represented, particularly in the early time course, by NPRM than by 2C modeling constructs, and improvements in fit were statistically highly significant. Although18F-FDG flux values evaluated by NPRM and 2C modeling were generally similar, significant deviations between vascular blood and distribution volume estimates were found. The bootstrap enables the assessment of quite complex summaries of mapped kinetics. This is illustrated with maximum-intensity maps of kinetics and their uncertainties.Conclusion:NPRM kinetics combined with image-domain bootstrapping is practical with large whole-body dynamic18F-FDG datasets. The information provided by bootstrapping could support more sophisticated uses of PET biomarkers used in clinical decision-making for the individual patient.

JOURNAL: Nuclear medicine and biology

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Background: Accurate assessment of myocardial ketone uptake and oxidation is essential for understanding cardiac metabolism. This study aims to validate positron emission tomography (PET) imaging as a non-invasive method for quantifying myocardial ketone metabolism, using the invasive arteriovenous (AV) balance method as reference.

Methods: Myocardial ketone uptake was assessed using [11C]β-hydroxybutyrate ([11C]OHB) PET imaging in a porcine model. Blood samples were collected from arterial and coronary sinus sites, and kinetic parameters were calculated to evaluate the relationship between PET-derived and AV balance-derived measurements. Myocardial perfusion was assessed using [15O]water PET scans. The procedures were conducted during a graded infusion of ketone salt.

Results: A strong positive correlation between PET-derived and AV balance-derived measurements of myocardial OHB uptake was observed (r = 0.97; p < 0.0001), indicating that [11C]OHB PET imaging can reliably assess myocardial ketone metabolism. The correlation between the rate constant k2and the [11C]CO2fraction in coronary sinus blood was near-significant, moderate and positive (r = 0.71; p = 0.08), suggesting potential for k2as a marker of myocardial ketone oxidation.

Conclusion: [11C]OHB PET imaging is a non-invasive tool for assessing myocardial ketone metabolism, providing valuable insights into ketone uptake and oxidation in vivo, with potential for extrapolation to human data.

TITLE: Kinetic Modelling and Test-Retest Reproducibility for the Dopamine D1R Radioligand [11C]SCH23390 in Healthy and Diseased Mice

JOURNAL: Molecular imaging and biology

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Our aim in this study was to compare different non-invasive pharmacokinetic models and assess test-retest reproducibility of the radioligand [11C]SCH23390 for the quantification of dopamine D1-like receptor (D1R) in both wild-type (WT) mice and heterozygous (HET) Q175DN mice as Huntington's disease (HD) model.

Procedures: Adult WT (n = 9) and HET (n = 14) mice underwent a 90-min [11C]SCH23390 positron emission tomography (PET) scan followed by computed tomography (CT) to evaluate the pharmacokinetic modelling in healthy and diseased conditions. Additionally, 5 WT mice and 7 HET animals received a second [11C]SCH23390 PET scan for test-retest reproducibility. Parallel assessment of the simplified reference tissue model (SRTM), the multilinear reference tissue model (MRTM) and the Logan reference tissue model (Logan Ref) using the striatum as a receptor-rich region and the cerebellum as a receptor-free (reference) region was performed to define the most suitable method for regional- and voxel-based quantification of the binding potential (BPND). Finally, standardised uptake value ratio (SUVR-1) was assessed as a potential simplified measurement.

Results: For all models, we measured a significant decline in dopamine D1R density (e.g. SRTM = - 38.5 ± 5.0 %, p < 0.0001) in HET mice compared to WT littermates. Shortening the 90-min scan duration resulted in large underestimation of striatal BPNDin both WT mice (SRTM 60 min: - 17.7 ± 2.8 %, p = 0.0078) and diseased HET (SRTM 60 min: - 13.1 ± 4.1 %, p = 0.0001). Striatal BPNDmeasurements were very reproducible with an average test-retest variability below 5 % when using both MRTM and SRTM. Parametric BPNDmaps generated with SRTM were highly reliable, showing nearly perfect agreement to the regional analysis (r2= 0.99, p < 0.0001). Finally, SRTM provided the most accurate estimate for relative tracer delivery R1with both regional- and voxel-based analyses. SUVR-1 at different time intervals were not sufficiently reliable when compared to BPND(r2< 0.66).

Conclusions: Ninety-minute acquisition and the use of SRTM for pharmacokinetic modelling is recommended. [11C]SCH23390 PET imaging demonstrates optimal characteristics for the study of dopamine D1R density in models of psychiatric and neurological disorders as exemplified in the Q175DN mouse model of HD.

JOURNAL: Research square

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: The sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor-1 (S1PR1) is involved in regulating responses to neuroimmune stimuli. There is a need for S1PR1-specific radioligands with clinically suitable brain pharmcokinetic properties to complement existing radiotracers. This work evaluated a promising S1PR1radiotracer, [18F]TZ4877, in nonhuman primates.

Procedures: [18F]TZ4877 was produced via nucleophilic substitution of tosylate precursor with K[18F]/F-followed by deprotection. Brain PET imaging data were acquired with a Focus220 scanner in twoMacaca mulatta(6, 13 years old) for 120-180 min following bolus injection of 118-163 MBq [18F]TZ4877, with arterial blood sampling and metabolite analysis to measure the parent input function and plasma free fraction (fP). Each animal was scanned at baseline, 15-18 min after 0.047-0.063 mg/kg of the S1PR1inhibitor ponesimod, 33 min after 0.4-0.8 mg/kg of the S1PR1-specific compound TZ82112, and 167-195 min after 1 ng/kg of the immune stimulus endotoxin. Kinetic analysis with metabolite-corrected input function was performed to estimate the free fraction corrected total distribution volume (VT/fP). Whole-body dosimetry scans were acquired in 2 animals (1M, 1F) with a Biograph Vision PET/CT System, and absorbed radiation dose estimates were calculated with OLINDA.

Results: [18F]TZ4877 exhibited fast kinetics that were described by the reversible 2-tissue compartment model. Baseline [18F]TZ4877fPwas low (< 1%), and [18F]TZ4877VT/fPvalues were 233-866 mL/cm3. TZ82112 dose-dependently reduced [18F]TZ4877VT/fP, while ponesimod and endotoxin exhibited negligible effects onVT/fP, possibly due to scan timing relative to dosing. Dosimetry studies identified the critical organs of gallbladder (0.42 (M) and 0.31 (F) mSv/MBq) for anesthetized nonhuman primate.

Conclusions: [18F]TZ4877 exhibits reversible kinetic properties, but the lowfPvalue limits quantification with this radiotracer. S1PR1is a compelling PET imaging target, and these data support pursuing alternative F-18 labeled radiotracers for potential future human studies.

TITLE: A waste-to-wealth conversion of plastic bottles into effective carbon-based adsorbents for removal of tetracycline antibiotic from water

AUTHORS: Loan Thi Kim Duong, Thuy Thi Thanh Nguyen, Luan Minh Nguyen, Thu Hien Hoang, Duyen Thi Cam Nguyen, Thuan Van Tran

JOURNAL: Environmental research

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Currently, plastic waste and antibiotic wastewater are two of the most critical environmental problems, calling for urgent measures to take. A waste-to-wealth strategy for the conversion of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic bottles into value-added materials such as carbon composite is highly recommended to clean wastewater contaminated by antibiotics. Inspired by this idea, we develop a novel PET-AC-ZFO composite by incorporating PET plastic-derived KOH-activated carbon (AC) with ZnFe2O4(ZFO) particles for adsorptive removal of tetracycline (TTC). PET-derived carbon (PET-C), KOH-activated PET-derived carbon (PET-AC), and PET-AC-ZFO were characterized using physicochemical analyses. Central composite design (CCD) was used to obtain a quadratic model by TTC concentration (K), adsorbent dosage (L), and pH (M). PET-AC-ZFO possessed micropores (d ≈ 2 nm) and exceptionally high surface area of 1110 m2g-1. Nearly 90% TTC could be removed by PET-AC-ZFO composite. Bangham kinetic and Langmuir isotherm were two most fitted models. Theoretical maximum TTC adsorption capacity was 45.1 mg g-1. This study suggested the role of hydrogen bonds, pore-filling interactions, and π-π interactions as the main interactions of the adsorption process. Thus, a strategy for conversion of PET bottles into PET-AC-ZFO can contribute to both plastic recycling and antibiotic wastewater mitigation.

ABSTRACT:
Kinetic modelling of brain PET data is crucial for estimating quantitative biological parameters, traditionally requiring arterial sampling. This study evaluated whether arterial samples could be omitted to estimate the image-derived input function (IDIF) using a long axial field-of-view PET scanner. The use of internal carotid arteries (ICA) for IDIF estimation, along with venous samples for plasma-to-whole blood ratios and plasma parent fractions, was also assessed. Six healthy volunteers underwent [18F]MC225 scans with manual arterial sampling. IDIFs were derived from the aortic arch (IDIFAA) and calibrated using manual arterial samples (IDIFAA_CAL). ICA-derived IDIF was also calibrated (IDIFCA_CAL) and compared to IDIFAA_CAL. In a separate group of six volunteers, venous and arterial samples were collected to evaluate plasma-to-whole blood ratios, plasma parent fractions, and IDIF calibration (IDIFCA_CAL_VEN). Volume of distribution (VT) of different brain regions was estimated for all IDIFs techniques, corrected for plasma-to-whole blood ratio and plasma parent fraction (IDIFAA,P, IDIFAA_CAL,P, IDIFICA_CAL,Pand IDIFICA_CAL_VEN_P). Our findings revealed discrepancies between IDIFAAand arterial samples, highlighting the importance of calibration. The differences between IDIFAA,Pand IDIFAA_CAL,Pwere 9.2% for area under the curve and 4.0% for brain VT. IDIFICA_CAL,Pshowed strong agreement with IDIFA_CAL,P, with 1.2% VTdifference. Venous sampling showed consistent agreement with arterial sampling for plasma parameters but was unreliable for IDIF calibration, leading to 39% VTdifferences. This study emphasises that arterial samples are still required for IDIF calibration and reliable VTestimation for [18F]MC225 PET tracer. ICA-derived IDIF, when calibrated, provides reliable VTestimates. Venous sampling is a potential alternative for estimating plasma parameters, but it is unsuitable for IDIF calibration.

TITLE: Fast 4D-PET parametric imaging computation at the whole field of view level: Reliability under simulated conditions of PET KinetiX, a dedicated software solution

AUTHORS: Sylvain Faure, Adrien Paillet, Claude Comtat, Florent L Besson

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: The reliability of a new academic software, PET KinetiX, designed for fast parametric 4D-PET imaging computation, is assessed under simulated conditions.

Methods: 4D-PET data were simulated using the XCAT digital phantom and realistic time-activity curves (ground truth). Four hundred analytical simulations were reconstructed using CASToR, an open-source software for tomographic reconstruction, replicating the clinical characteristics of two available PET systems with short and long axial fields of view (SAFOV and LAFOV). A total of 2,800 Patlak and 2TCM kinetic parametric maps of18F-FDG were generated using PET KinetiX. The mean biases and standard deviations of the kinetic parametric maps were computed for each tissue label and compared to the biases of unprocessed SUV data. Additionally, the mean absolute ratio of kinetic-to-SUV contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) was estimated for each tissue structure, along with the corresponding standard deviations.

Results: The Kiand vbparametric maps produced by PET KinetiX faithfully reproduced the predefined multi-tissue structures of the XCAT digital phantom for both Patlak and 2TCM models. Image definition was influenced by the 4D-PET input data: a higher number of iterations resulted in sharper rendering and higher standard deviations in PET signal characteristics. Biases relative to the ground truth varied across tissue structures and hardware configurations, similarly to unprocessed SUV data. In most tissue structures, Patlak kinetic-to-SUV CNR ratios exceeded 1 for both SAFOV and LAFOV configurations. The highest kinetic-to-SUV CNR ratio was observed in 2TCM k₃ maps within tumor regions.

Conclusion: PET KinetiX currently generates Kiand vbparametric maps that are qualitatively comparable to unprocessed SUV data, with improved CNR in most cases. The 2TCM k₃ parametric maps for tumor structures exhibited the highest CNR enhancement, warranting further evaluation across different anatomical regions and radiotracer applications.

ABSTRACT:
Background: Correct classification of estrogen receptor (ER) status is essential for prognosis and treatment planning in patients with breast cancer (BC). Therefore, it is recommended to sample tumor tissue from an accessible metastasis. However, ER expression can show intra- and intertumoral heterogeneity. 16α-[18F]fluoroestradiol ([18F]FES) Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (PET/CT) allows noninvasive whole-body (WB) identification of ER distribution and is usually performed as a single static image 60 min after radiotracer injection. Using dynamic whole-body (D-WB) PET imaging, we examine [18F]FES kinetics and explore whether Patlak parametric images () are quantitative and improve lesion visibility.

Results: This prospective study included eight patients with metastatic ER-positive BC scanned using a D-WB PET acquisition protocol. The kinetics of [18F]FES were best characterized by the irreversible two-tissue compartment model in tumor lesions and in the majority of organ tissues.values from Patlak parametric images correlated withvalues from the full kinetic analysis, r2= 0.77, and with the semiquantitative mean standardized uptake value (SUVmean), r2= 0.91. Furthermore, parametricimages had the highest target-to-background ratio (TBR) in 162/164 metastatic lesions and the highest contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) in 99/164 lesions compared to conventional SUV images. TBR was 2.45 (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.25-2.68) and CNR 1.17 (95% CI: 1.08-1.26) times higher inimages compared to SUV images. These quantitative differences were seen as reduced background activity in theimages.

Conclusion: [18F]FES uptake is best described by an irreversible two-tissue compartment model. D-WB [18F]FES PET/CT scans can be used for direct reconstruction of parametricimages, with superior lesion visibility andvalues comparable tovalues found from full kinetic analyses. This may aid correct ER classification and treatment decisions. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov:NCT04150731, https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04150731.

AUTHORS: Dae-Myoung Yang, Ryan Alfano, Glenn Bauman, Jonathan D Thiessen, Joseph Chin, Stephen Pautler, Madeleine Moussa, Jose A Gomez, Irina Rachinsky, Mena Gaed, Kevin J Chung, Aaron Ward, Ting-Yim Lee

JOURNAL: EJNMMI research

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Localized prostate cancer (PCa) in patients is characterized by a dominant focus in the gland (dominant intraprostatic lesion, DIL). Accurate DIL identification may enable more accurate diagnosis and therapy through more precise targeting of biopsy, radiotherapy and focal ablative therapies. The goal of this study is to validate the performance of [18F]DCFPyL PET and CT perfusion (CTP) for detecting and localizing DIL against digital histopathological images.

Methods: Multi-modality image sets: in vivo T2-weighted (T2w)-MRI, 22-min dynamic [18F]DCFPyL PET/CT, CTP, and 2-h post-injection PET/MR were acquired in patients prior to radical prostatectomy. The explanted gland with implanted fiducial markers was imaged with T2w-MRI. All images were co-registered to the pathologist-annotated digital images of whole-mount mid-gland histology sections using fiducial markers and anatomical landmarks. Regions of interest encompassing DIL and non-DIL tissue were drawn on the digital histopathological images and superimposed on PET and CTP parametric maps. Logistic regression with backward elimination of parameters was used to select the most sensitive parameter set to distinguish DIL from non-DIL voxels. Leave-one-patient-out cross-validation was performed to determine diagnostic performance.

Results: [18F]DCFPyL PET and CTP parametric maps of 15 patients were analyzed. SUVLateand a model combining Kiand k4of [18F]DCFPyL achieved the most accurate performance distinguishing DIL from non-DIL voxels. Both detection models achieved an AUC of 0.90 and an error rate of < 10%. Compared to digital histopathology, the detected DILs had a mean dice similarity coefficient of 0.8 for the Kiand k4model and 0.7 for SUVLate.

Conclusions: We have validated using co-registered digital histopathological images that parameters from kinetic analysis of 22-min dynamic [18F]DCFPyL PET can accurately localize DILs in PCa for targeting of biopsy, radiotherapy, and focal ablative therapies. Short-duration dynamic [18F]DCFPyL PET was not inferior to SUVLatein this diagnostic task.

ABSTRACT:
Chemical activated carbons (PET-H2SO4and PET-KOH) were prepared from post-consumer polyethylene terephthalate (PET) wastes using pyrolysis under moderate reaction temperatures by changing pyrolysis time and chemical activating agents. The produced carbons were characterized and tested in adsorption reactions of manganese, chromium, and cobalt ions in aqueous solutions. Results showed a high percentage removal of these inorganic ions from water: 98 % for Mn2+, 87 % for Cr3+, and 88 % for Co2+. Freundlich isotherms gave a better fit to the experimental data obtained with good correlation coefficient values in the range of 0.99-1 compared to other isotherms. The pseudo-second order kinetic model best described the chemical adsorption process as an exchange of electrons between the carbon and inorganic ions in solutions. The diffusion models showed that the process is controlled by a multi-kinetic stage adsorption process. In summary, this work demonstrates that the production of activated carbon from PET waste bottles is a potential alternative to commercial activated carbon and can be considered a sustainable waste management technology for removing these non-biodegradable plastic wastes from the environment.

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: To describe the pharmacokinetic properties of the [18F]fluoro-polyethylene glycol(PEG)-folate radiotracer in PET/CT imaging of patients with advanced stage epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC).

Procedures: In five patients with advanced EOC (FIGO stage IIIB/IIIC, Fédération Internationale de Gynécologie et d'Obstétrique), a 90-min dynamic PET acquisition of the pelvis was performed directly after i.v. administration of 185 MBq [18F]fluoro-PEG6-folate. Arterial blood samples collected at nineteen timepoints were used to determine the plasma input function. A static volume of interest (VOI) for included tumor lesions was drawn manually on the PET images. Modelling was performed using PMOD software. Three different models (a 1-tissue compartment model (1T2k) and two 2-tissue compartment models, irreversible (2T3k) and reversible (2T4k)) were compared in goodness of fit with the time activity curves by means of the Akaike information criterion.

Results: The pharmacokinetic analysis in the pelvic area has proven to be much more challenging than expected. Only four out of 22 tumor lesions in five patients were considered suitable to perform modelling on. The remaining tumor lesions were inapt due to either low tracer uptake, small size, proximity to other [18F]fluoro-PEG6-folate -avid structures and/or displacement by abdominal organ motion in the dynamic scan. Data from the four analyzed tumor lesions suggest that the irreversible 2T3k may best describe the pharmacokinetics. All 22 lesions were immunohistochemically stained positive for the folate receptor alpha (FRα) after resection.

Conclusion: Performing pharmacokinetic analysis in the abdominal pelvic region is very challenging. This brief article describes the challenges and pitfalls in pharmacokinetic analysis of a tracer with high physiological accumulation in the intestines, in case of lesions of limited size in the abdominal pelvic area.

ABSTRACT:
The present study aimed to investigate the correlation at pre-treatment (TX) between quantitative metrics derived from multimodality imaging (MMI), including18F-FDG-PET/CT,18F-FMISO-PET/CT, DW- and DCE-MRI, using a community detection algorithm (CDA) in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients. Twenty-three HNSCC patients with 27 metastatic lymph nodes underwent a total of 69 MMI exams at pre-TX. Correlations among quantitative metrics derived from FDG-PET/CT (SUL), FMSIO-PET/CT (K1, k3, TBR, and DV), DW-MRI (ADC, IVIM [D, D*, and f]), and FXR DCE-MRI [Ktrans, ve, and τi]) were investigated using the CDA based on a "spin-glass model" coupled with the Spearman's rank, ρ, analysis. Mean MRI T2weighted tumor volumes and SULmeanvalues were moderately positively correlated (ρ = 0.48,p= 0.01). ADC and D exhibited a moderate negative correlation with SULmean(ρ ≤ -0.42,p< 0.03 for both). K1and Ktranswere positively correlated (ρ = 0.48,p= 0.01). In contrast, Ktransand k3maxwere negatively correlated (ρ = -0.41,p= 0.03). CDA revealed four communities for 16 metrics interconnected with 33 edges in the network. DV, Ktrans, and K1had 8, 7, and 6 edges in the network, respectively. After validation in a larger population, the CDA approach may aid in identifying useful biomarkers for developing individual patient care in HNSCC.

TITLE: Pharmacokinetic analysis of [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-TOC PET in meningiomas for assessment of in vivo somatostatin receptor subtype 2

AUTHORS: Asma Bashir, Mark Bitsch Vestergaard, Tina Binderup, Helle Broholm, Lisbeth Marner, Morten Ziebell, Kåre Fugleholm, Tiit Mathiesen, Andreas Kjær, Ian Law

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: DOTA-D-Phe1-Tyr3-octreotide with gallium-68 ([68Ga]Ga-DOTA-TOC) is one of the PET tracers that forms the basis for peptide receptor radionuclide therapy based on somatostatin receptor subtype 2 (SSTR2) expression in meningiomas. Yet, the quantitative relationship between [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-TOC accumulation and SSTR2 is unknown. We conducted a correlative analysis of a range of [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-TOC PET metric(s) as imaging surrogate(s) of the receptor binding in meningiomas by correlating the PET results with SSTR2 expression from surgical specimens. We additionally investigated possible influences of secondary biological factors such as vascularization, inflammation and proliferation.

Methods: Fifteen patients with MRI-presumed or recurrent meningiomas underwent a 60-min dynamic [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-TOC PET/CT before surgery. The PET data comprised maximum and mean standardized uptake values (SUVmax, SUVmean) with and without normalization to reference regions, and quantitative measurements derived from kinetic modelling using a reversible two-tissue compartment model with the fractional blood volume (VB). Expressions of SSTR2 and proliferation (Ki-67, phosphohistone-H3, proliferating cell nuclear antigen) were determined by immunohistochemistry and/or quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), while biomarkers of vascularization (vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), endothelial marker CD34) and inflammation (cytokine interleukin-18, microglia/macrophage-specific marker CD68) by qPCR.

Results: Histopathology revealed 12 World Health Organization (WHO) grade I and three WHO grade II meningiomas showing no link to SSTR2. The majority of [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-TOC PET metrics showed significant associations with SSTR2 protein, while all PET metrics were positively correlated with SSTR2 mRNA with the best results for mean tumour-to-blood ratio (TBRmean) (r = 0.757, P = 0.001) and SUVmean(r = 0.714, P = 0.003). Significant positive correlations were also found between [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-TOC PET metrics, and VEGFA and VB. SSTR2 mRNA was moderately correlated with VEGFA (r = 0.539, P = 0.038). Neither [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-TOC PET metrics nor SSTR2 were correlated with proliferation or inflammation.

Conclusion: [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-TOC accumulation in meningiomas is associated with SSTR2 binding and vascularization with TBRmeanbeing the best PET metric for assessing SSTR2.

ABSTRACT:
The arginine-vasopressin (AVP) hormone plays a pivotal role in regulating various physiological processes, such as hormone secretion, cardiovascular modulation, and social behavior. Recent studies have highlighted the V1a receptor as a promising therapeutic target. In-depth insights into V1a receptor-related pathologies, attained throughin vivoimaging and quantification in both peripheral organs and the central nervous system (CNS), could significantly advance the development of effective V1a inhibitors. To address this need, we develop a novel V1a-targeted positron emission tomography (PET) ligand, [18F]V1A-2303 ([18F]8), which demonstrates favorablein vitrobinding affinity and selectivity for the V1a receptor. Specific tracer binding in peripheral tissues was also confirmed through rigorous cell uptake studies, autoradiography, biodistribution assessments. Furthermore, [18F]8was employed in PET imaging and arterial blood sampling studies in healthy rhesus monkeys to assess its brain permeability and specificity, whole-body distribution, and kinetic properties. Our research indicated [18F]8as a valuable tool for noninvasively studying V1a receptors in peripheral organs, and as a foundational element for the development of next-generation, brain-penetrant ligands specifically designed for the CNS.

TITLE: Microplastics in dyeing sludge: Whether do they affect sludge incineration?

AUTHORS: Xiaoao Shi, Jinping Li, Lingna Shang, Sijia Wang, Si Chen, Jingxin Liu, Meng Mei, Yongjie Xue, Teng Wang

JOURNAL: Journal of hazardous materials

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Microplastics (MPs), as emerging contaminant detected in dyeing sludge (DS), inevitably affected the subsequent treatment and disposal of DS. However, the effect of MPs on the predominant disposal path (incineration) of DS remains far from explicit. This study used thermogravimetry-mass spectrometry (TG-MS) method to explore the effect of representative MPs, polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC), on combustion characteristics, gas evolution and kinetics on DS combustion. Results showed that PET inhibited the whole combustion of DS by physical barrier. Relatively, PVC delayed the combustion of light volatile but promoted heavy volatile and char reaction due to HCl catalyst. Generally, MPs deteriorated the combustibility, burnout performance and combustion stability of DS. MPs aggravated HCl and gaseous N emissions. Noticeably, the interactions between DS and PVC accelerated the emissions of gaseous pollutants, especially under high dose condition. DAEM and FWO models could well describe the combustion kinetic of DS containing MPs. MPs led to an increase in activation energy of DS, namely, it deteriorated the combustion efficiency of DS. The combustion mechanisms could be divided into two stages: (1) diffusion (D3) stage: melted MPs blocked the gas channels, (2) chemical reaction (F3): the residual chars were thermally stable.

TITLE: The brain's "dark energy" puzzle upgraded: [18F]FDG uptake, delivery and phosphorylation, and their coupling with resting-state brain activity

JOURNAL: bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
The brain's resting-state energy consumption is expected to be mainly driven by spontaneous activity. In our previous work, we extracted a wide range of features from resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI), and used them to predict [18F]FDG PET SUVR as a proxy of glucose metabolism. Here, we expanded upon our previous effort by estimating [18F]FDG kinetic parameters according to Sokoloff's model, i.e.,(irreversible uptake rate),(delivery),(phosphorylation), in a large healthy control group. The parameters' spatial distribution was described at a high spatial resolution. We showed that whileis the least redundant, there are relevant differences betweenand(occipital cortices, cerebellum and thalamus). Using multilevel modeling, we investigated how much of the regional variability of [18F]FDG parameters could be explained by a combination of rs-fMRI variables only, or with the addition of cerebral blood flow (CBF) and metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2), estimated from15O PET data. We found that combining rs-fMRI and CMRO2led to satisfactory prediction of individualvariance (45%). Although more difficult to describe,andwere both most sensitive to local rs-fMRI variables, whilewas sensitive to CMRO2. This work represents the most comprehensive assessment to date of the complex functional and metabolic underpinnings of brain glucose consumption.

TITLE: Impact of Cytochrome Induction or Inhibition on the Plasma and Brain Kinetics of [11C]metoclopramide, a PET Probe for P-Glycoprotein Function at the Blood-Brain Barrier

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
[11C]metoclopramide PET imaging provides a sensitive and translational tool to explore P-glycoprotein (P-gp) function at the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Patients with neurological diseases are often treated with cytochrome (CYP) modulators which may impact the plasma and brain kinetics of [11C]metoclopramide. The impact of the CYP inducer carbamazepine or the CYP inhibitor ritonavir on the brain and plasma kinetics of [11C]metoclopramide was investigated in rats. Data obtained in a control group were compared with groups that were either orally pretreated with carbamazepine (45 mg/kg twice a day for 7 days before PET) or ritonavir (20 mg/kg, 3 h before PET) (n = 4 per condition). Kinetic modelling was performed to estimate the brain penetration (VT) of [11C]metoclopramide. CYP induction or inhibition had negligible impact on the plasma kinetics and metabolism of [11C]metoclopramide. Moreover, carbamazepine neither impacted the brain kinetics nor VT of [11C]metoclopramide (p > 0.05). However, ritonavir significantly increased VT (p < 0.001), apparently behaving as an inhibitor of P-gp at the BBB. Our data suggest that treatment with potent CYP inducers such as carbamazepine does not bias the estimation of P-gp function at the BBB with [11C]metoclopramide PET. This supports further use of [11C]metoclopramide for studies in animals and patients treated with CYP inducers.

ABSTRACT:
Background: 89Zirconium-immuno-positron emission tomography (89Zr-immuno-PET) is used for assessment of target status to guide antibody-based therapy. We aim to determine the relation between antibody tumor uptake and target concentration to improve future study design and interpretation.

Methods: The relation between tumor uptake and target concentration was predicted by mathematical modeling of89Zr-labeled antibody disposition in the tumor. Literature values for trastuzumab kinetics were used to provide an example.

Results: 89Zr-trastuzumab uptake initially increases with increasing target concentration, until it levels off to a constant value. This is determined by the total administered mass dose of trastuzumab. For a commonly used imaging dose of 50 mg89Zr-trastuzumab, uptake can discriminate between immunohistochemistry score (IHC) 0 versus 1-2-3.

Conclusion: The example for89Zr-trastuzumab illustrates the potential to assess target expression. The pitfall of false-positive findings depends on the cut-off to define clinical target positivity (i.e., IHC 3) and the administered mass dose.

JOURNAL: The Journal of biological chemistry

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) is a major plastic polymer utilized in the single-use and textile industries. The discovery of PET-degrading enzymes (PETases) has led to an increased interest in the biological recycling of PET in addition to mechanical recycling. IsPETase from Ideonella sakaiensis is a candidate catalyst, but little is understood about its structure-function relationships with regards to PET degradation. To understand the effects of mutations on IsPETase productivity, we develop a directed evolution assay to identify mutations beneficial to PET film degradation at 30 °C. IsPETase also displays enzyme concentration-dependent inhibition effects, and surface crowding has been proposed as a causal phenomenon. Based on total internal reflectance fluorescence microscopy and adsorption experiments, IsPETase is likely experiencing crowded conditions on PET films. Molecular dynamics simulations of IsPETase variants reveal a decrease in active site flexibility in free enzymes and reduced probability of productive active site formation in substrate-bound enzymes under crowding. Hence, we develop a surface crowding model to analyze the biochemical effects of three hit mutations (T116P, S238N, S290P) that enhanced ambient temperature activity and/or thermostability. We find that T116P decreases susceptibility to crowding, resulting in higher PET degradation product accumulation despite no change in intrinsic catalytic rate. In conclusion, we show that a macromolecular crowding-based biochemical model can be used to analyze the effects of mutations on properties of PETases and that crowding behavior is a major property to be targeted for enzyme engineering for improved PET degradation.

ABSTRACT:
The novel tau-PET tracer [18F]PI-2620 detects the 3/4-repeat-(R)-tauopathy Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the 4R-tauopathies corticobasal syndrome (CBS) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). We determined whether [18F]PI-2620 binding characteristics deriving from non-invasive reference tissue modelling differentiate 3/4R- and 4R-tauopathies. Ten patients with a 3/4R tauopathy (AD continuum) and 29 patients with a 4R tauopathy (CBS, PSP) were evaluated. [18F]PI-2620 PET scans were acquired 0-60 min p.i. and the distribution volume ratio (DVR) was calculated. [18F]PI-2620-positive clusters (DVR ≥ 2.5 SD vs. 11 healthy controls) were evaluated by non-invasive kinetic modelling. R1 (delivery), k2 & k2a (efflux), DVR, 30-60 min standardized-uptake-value-ratios (SUVR30-60) and the linear slope of post-perfusion phase SUVR (9-60 min p.i.) were compared between 3/4R- and 4R-tauopathies. Cortical clusters of 4R-tau cases indicated higher delivery (R1SRTM: 0.92 ± 0.21 vs. 0.83 ± 0.10, p = 0.0007), higher efflux (k2SRTM: 0.17/min ±0.21/min vs. 0.06/min ± 0.07/min, p < 0.0001), lower DVR (1.1 ± 0.1 vs. 1.4 ± 0.2, p < 0.0001), lower SUVR30-60(1.3 ± 0.2 vs. 1.8 ± 0.3, p < 0.0001) and flatter slopes of the post-perfusion phase (slope9-60: 0.006/min ± 0.007/min vs. 0.016/min ± 0.008/min, p < 0.0001) when compared to 3/4R-tau cases. [18F]PI-2620 binding characteristics in cortical regions differentiate 3/4R- and 4R-tauopathies. Higher tracer clearance indicates less stable binding in 4R tauopathies when compared to 3/4R-tauopathies.

TITLE: Kinetic and structural analysis of the inactivation of urease by mixed-ligand phosphine halide Ag(I) complexes

AUTHORS: Luca Mazzei, Damiano Cirri, Michele Cianci, Luigi Messori, Stefano Ciurli

JOURNAL: Journal of inorganic biochemistry

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Soft metal ions can inactivate urease, a Ni(II)-dependent enzyme whose hydrolytic activity has significant implications in agro-environmental science and human health. Kinetic and structural studies of the reaction of Canavalia ensiformis urease (JBU) and Sporosarcina pasteurii urease (SPU) with Ag(I) compounds of general formula [Ag(PEt3)X]4(X = Cl, Br, I), and with the ionic species [Ag(PEt3)2]NO3, revealed the role of the Ag(I) ion and its ligands in modulating the metal-enzyme interaction. The activity of JBU is obliterated by the [Ag(PEt3)X]4complexes, with IC50values in the nanomolar range; the efficiency of the inhibition increases in the Cl-< Br-< I-order. The activity of JBU upon [Ag(PEt3)2]NO3addition decreases to a plateau corresponding to ca. 60% of the original activity and decreases with time at a reduced rate. Synchrotron X-ray crystallography on single crystals obtained after the incubation of SPU with the Ag(I) complexes yielded high-resolution (1.63-1.97 Å) structures. The metal-protein adducts entail a dinuclear Ag(I) cluster bound to the conserved residues αCys322, αHis323, and αMet367, with a bridging cysteine thiolate atom, a weak Ag…Ag bond, and a quasi-linear Ag(I) coordination geometry. These observations suggest a mechanism that involves the initial substitution of the phosphine ligand, followed by a structural rearrangement to yield the dinuclear Ag(I) cluster. These findings indicate that urease, in addition to the active site dinuclear Ni(II) cluster, possesses a secondary metal binding site, located on the mobile flap domain, capable of recognizing pairs of soft metal ions and controlling catalysis.

TITLE: Hypoxia adapted relative biological effectiveness models for proton therapy: a simulation study

JOURNAL: Biomedical physics & engineering express

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
In proton therapy, a constant relative biological effectiveness (RBE) factor of 1.1 is applied although the RBE has been shown to depend on factors including the Linear Energy Transfer (LET). The biological effectiveness of radiotherapy has also been shown to depend on the level of oxygenation, quantified by the oxygen enhancement ratio (OER). To estimate the biological effectiveness across different levels of oxygenation the RBE-OER-weighted dose (ROWD) can be used. To investigate the consistency between different approaches to estimate ROWD, we implemented and compared OER models in a Monte Carlo (MC) simulation tool. Five OER models were explored: Wenzl and Wilkens 2011 (WEN), Tinganelliet al2015 (TIN), Strigariet al2018 (STR), Dahleet al2020 (DAH) and Meinet al2021 (MEI). OER calculations were combined with a proton RBE model and the microdosimetric kinetic model for ROWD calculations. ROWD and OER were studied for a water phantom scenario and a head and neck cancer case using hypoxia PET data for the OER calculation. The OER and ROWD estimates from the WEN, MEI and DAH showed good agreement while STR and TIN gave higher OER values and lower ROWD. The WEN, STR and DAH showed some degree of OER-LET dependency while this was negligible for the MEI and TIN models. The ROWD for all implemented models is reduced in hypoxic regions with an OER of 1.0-2.1 in the target volume. While some variations between the models were observed, all models display a large difference in the estimated dose from hypoxic and normoxic regions. This shows the potential to increase the dose or LET in hypoxic regions or reduce the dose to normoxic regions which again could lead to normal tissue sparing. With reliable hypoxia imaging, RBE-OER weighting could become a useful tool for proton therapy plan optimization.

TITLE: Treatment of nitrate containing wastewater by adsorption process using polypyrrole-modified plastic-carbon: Characteristic and mechanism

AUTHORS: Yuanyuan Shen, Nan Chen, Zhengyuan Feng, Chuanping Feng, Yang Deng

JOURNAL: Chemosphere

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Polypyrrole-modified plastic-carbon (PET-PPy) composite was prepared by using high porosity plastic-carbon materials and a special doping mechanism of polypyrrole to remove nitrate from water to achieve waste recycling. As a result, PET-PPy-500 showed remarkable nitrate adsorption in both acidic and alkaline wastewater. The pseudo-second-order kinetic and Langmuir isotherm models were fit for the nitrate adsorption by PET-PPy-500, and the maximum adsorption capacity predicted by the Langmuir model was 10.04 mg NO3-N/g (45.18 mg NO3-/g) at 30 °C. The ion exchange and electrostatic attraction were the main mechanisms of removing NO3-by PET-PPy-500, which was demonstrated by the interface characterization and theoretical calculation. The doped ions (Cl-) and/or other anions produced by charge transfer interaction were the main exchange ions in the process of NO3-adsorption. The main binding sites in the electrostatic adsorption process were nitrogen-containing functional groups, which can be confirmed by the results of XPS and density functional theory (DFT). Furthermore, DFT results also showed that the adsorption of nitrate by PET-PPy was a spontaneous exothermic process, and the adsorption energy at the nitrogen site was the lowest. The findings of this study provide a feasible strategy for the advanced treatment of nitrate containing wastewater.

TITLE: Towards the Integrative Theory of Alzheimer's Disease: Linking Molecular Mechanisms of Neurotoxicity, Beta-amyloid Biomarkers, and the Diagnosis

AUTHORS: Yaroslav I Molkov, Maria V Zaretskaia, Dmitry V Zaretsky

JOURNAL: Current Alzheimer research

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Introduction: A major gap in amyloid-centric theories of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is that even though amyloid fibrils per se are not toxic in vitro, the diagnosis of AD clearly correlates with the density of beta-amyloid (Aβ) deposits. Based on our proposed amyloid degradation toxicity hypothesis, we developed a mathematical model explaining this discrepancy. It suggests that cytotoxicity depends on the cellular uptake of soluble Aβ rather than on the presence of amyloid aggregates. The dynamics of soluble beta-amyloid in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the density of Aβ deposits is described using a system of differential equations. In the model, cytotoxic damage is proportional to the cellular uptake of Aβ, while the probability of an AD diagnosis is defined by the Aβ cytotoxicity accumulated over the duration of the disease. After uptake, Aβ is concentrated intralysosomally, promoting the formation of fibrillation seeds inside cells. These seeds cannot be digested and are either accumulated intracellularly or exocytosed. Aβ starts aggregating on the extracellular seeds and, therefore, decreases in concentration in the interstitial fluid. The dependence of both Aβ toxicity and aggregation on the same process-cellular uptake of Aβ-explains the correlation between AD diagnosis and the density of amyloid aggregates in the brain.

Methods: We tested the model using clinical data obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), which included records of beta-amyloid concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF-Aβ42) and the density of beta-amyloid deposits measured using positron emission tomography (PET). The model predicts the probability of AD diagnosis as a function of CSF-Aβ42 and PET and fits the experimental data at the 95% confidence level.

Results: Our study shows that existing clinical data allows for the inference of kinetic parameters describing beta-amyloid turnover and disease progression. Each combination of CSF-Aβ42 and PET values can be used to calculate the individual's cellular uptake rate, the effective disease duration, and the accumulated toxicity. We show that natural limitations on these parameters explain the characteristic distribution of the clinical dataset for these two biomarkers in the population.

Conclusion: The resulting mathematical model interprets the positive correlation between the density of Aβ deposits and the probability of an AD diagnosis without assuming any cytotoxicity of the aggregated beta-amyloid. To the best of our knowledge, this model is the first to mechanistically explain the negative correlation between the concentration of Aβ42 in the CSF and the probability of an AD diagnosis. Finally, based on the amyloid degradation toxicity hypothesis and the insights provided by mathematical modeling, we propose new pathophysiology-relevant biomarkers to diagnose and predict AD.

TITLE: PET Imaging of a Transgenic Tau Rat Model SHR24 with [18F]AV1451

AUTHORS: Nisha K Ramakrishnan, Annie Ziyi Zhao, Stephen Thompson, Selena Milicevic Sephton, David J Williamson, Tomáš Smolek, Norbert Žilka, Franklin I Aigbirhio

JOURNAL: Molecular imaging and biology

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scans with radioligands targeting tau neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) have accelerated our understanding of the role of misfolded tau in neurodegeneration. While intended for human research, applying these radioligands to small animals establishes a vital translational link. Transgenic animal models of dementia, such as the tau rat SHR24, play a crucial role in enhancing our understanding of these disorders. This study aims to evaluate the utility of SHR24 rat model for PET studies.

Procedures: Dynamic PET scans were conducted in male SHR24 rats and their wild-type SHR (SHRwt) littermates using [18F]AV1451. Rapid blood sampling and metabolite analysis were performed to acquire input curves. Time activity curves were obtained from various brain regions over 60 min. Blood-based, 2-Tissue Compartment Model (2-TCM) and Logan graphical analysis were used to obtain kinetic modelling parameters. The ability of reference tissue models to predict the binding potential (BPND) were assessed. Autoradiography studies were performed to corroborate the scan data.

Results: Total distribution volume (VT) was the best predicted parameter which revealed significantly higher uptake of [18F]AV1451 in the cortex (5.8 ± 1.1 vs 4.6 ± 0.7, P < 0.05) of SHR24 rats compared to SHRwt rats. Binding potential obtained from 2-TCM was variable, however BPNDfrom reference tissue models detected significantly higher binding in cortex (0.28 ± 0.07 vs 0.20 ± 0.04, P < 0.01 by SRTM) and brainstem (0.14 ± 0.04 vs 0.08 ± 0.02, P < 0.01, by SRTM).

Conclusions: With the ability to detect binding of established radioligand [18F]AV1451 in these rats, we have demonstrated the utility of this model for assessing aggregated tau neurobiology by PET, with reference tissue models providing potential for longitudinal studies.

TITLE: A systematic evaluation of five different image-derived input functions for the clinical implementation of 18F-NaF bone PET/CT in patients with chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder

AUTHORS: Jørn Theil, Marie Houmaa Vrist, Jesper Nørgaard Bech, Claire Anne Fynbo

JOURNAL: Frontiers in nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Introduction: The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of the use of varying input parameters on resulting bone plasma clearance () and other kinetic modelling parameters in a group of patients with chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD).

Methods: Raw PET/CT data and blood data were systematically analyzed using five different VOIs for the input functions in the left ventricle and in the thoracic aorta. Standardized VOIs were placed in four thoracic vertebrae and the results pooled and averaged. The basic image-derived input functions (IDIFs) were corrected for partial volume effect and spill-over and modified by substitution of the terminal image exponential with the corresponding plasma-exponentials derived from blood samples.was then calculated using both a non-linear regression (NLR) analysis and a graphical Patlak analysis and compared.

Results: Our original results were reproducible with an inter-observer difference of approximately 6%. The correction factors varied with the VOI volumes from 0.73 ± 0.17 for the largest LV-VOI (48.7 ± 25.3 cm3) to 0.99 ± 0.10 for the AO-VOI (3.4 ± 1.2 cm3). The mean NLR-results varied between 0.0378 ± 0.0112 and 0.0432 ± 0.0095 ml/min ml-1with a fixed vB and 0.0408 ± 0.0111 and 0.045 ± 0.0102 ml/min ml-1with a free-fitted vB. The corresponding Patl--results varied between 0.0302 ± 0.0071 and 0.0325 ± 0.0070 ml/min ml-1, having lesser differences and variances. The input functions with least variance and mean differences compared with NLR results were derived from the left ventricle with a VOI volume of 19.2 ± 11.3 cm3corrected for PVE and Bg with a mean-difference: 0.0097 ± 0.0370 ml/min ml-1and 95% confidence limits (-0.023 to 0.004).

Conclusions: Our results indicated that a VOI with a volume of approximately 20 cm3with a correction factor of 0.83 ± 0.13 results in Patlak results with the least variance and difference compared with the NLR results. The use of free-fitted vB in the NLR analysis showed the most robust results in all input series. The Patlak results were in comparison generally lower than the NLR results (-17.3% to -23.4%) but very robust across the various input series and with results comparable to previously published data and are therefore recommended for future analysis.

TITLE: Diagnostic value of dynamic 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging in non-small cell lung cancer and FDG hypermetabolic lymph nodes

AUTHORS: Yishan Sun, Liming Xiao, Yanmei Wang, Changping Liu, Li Cao, Wei Zhai, Bo Wang, Shupeng Yu, Jun Xin

JOURNAL: Quantitative imaging in medicine and surgery

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Background: We aimed to investigate the diagnostic value of dynamic 2-deoxy-2-[18F]-fluoro-D-glucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography in non-small cell lung cancer and fluoro-D-glucose hypermetabolic lymph nodes.

Methods: Patients who made an active appointment for positron emission tomography-computed tomography were randomly enrolled by referring to previous imaging data and clinical information. Finally, 34 histopathologically confirmed non-small cell lung cancers (18 adenocarcinoma and 16 squamous cell carcinoma cases) were prospectively studied using dynamic and static 2-deoxy-2-[18F]-fluoro-D-glucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography imaging (the diagnostic study has not yet been registered on a clinical trial platform). In dynamic positron emission tomography images, a volume of interest, defined by the thoracic aorta, was selected for estimating the arterial input function. Patlak and irreversible two-tissue compartment model analyses were performed based on the pixel points to obtain first-order characteristic kinetic parameters for each lesion and hypermetabolic lymph node. The first-order characteristic kinetic parameters were obtained based on the basic data of dynamic positron emission tomography images in the corresponding model and the lesion delineation of region-of-interest based on computed tomography images, such as V_Median (the median gray intensity of V), k3_Entropy, VB_Entropy, K1_Uniformity, and ki_Uniformity. The first-order characteristic kinetic parameters were also modeled by logistic regression for the differential diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer and hypermetabolic lymph nodes. Maximum and mean standard uptake values (SUVmax and SUVmean, respectively) were obtained from static positron emission tomography images. The diagnostic efficacy of the parameters was evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic curve and the DeLong test.

Results: There was a significant difference in the V_Median values of adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. The regression models for K1, k3, and V provided good predictions of adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma typology. Significant differences were observed in k3_Entropy, VB_Entropy, K1_Uniformity, and ki_Uniformity between benign and malignant lymph nodes. The regression model of Ki, VB, and k3 could make a good prediction for identifying benign and malignant lymph nodes.

Conclusions: Dynamic 2-deoxy-2-[18F]-fluoro-D-glucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography imaging showed high diagnostic value in the staging of non-small cell lung cancer and fluoro-D-glucose hypermetabolic lymph nodes, and can be of great use in non-small cell lung cancer lymph node staging and surgical decision-making.

TITLE: Timing Estimation and Limits in TOF-PET Detectors Producing Prompt Photons

AUTHORS: Francis Loignon-Houle, Maxime Toussaint, Émilie Bertrand, Félix Camirand Lemyre, Roger Lecomte

JOURNAL: IEEE transactions on radiation and plasma medical sciences

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
The production of prompt photons providing high photon time densities is a promising avenue to reach ultrahigh coincidence time resolution (CTR) in time-of-flight PET. Detectors producing prompt photons are receiving high interest experimentally, ignited by past exploratory theoretical studies that have anchored some guiding principles. Here, we aim to consolidate and extend the foundations for the analytical modeling of prompt generating detectors. We extend the current models to a larger range of prompt emission kinetics where more stringent requirements on the prompt photon yield rapidly emerge as a limiting factor. Lower bound and estimator evaluations are investigated with different underlying models, notably by merging or keeping separate the prompt and scintillation photon populations. We further show the potential benefits of knowing the proportion of prompt photons within a detection set to improve the CTR by mitigating the detrimental effect of population (prompt vs scintillation) mixing. Taking into account the fluctuations on the average number of detected prompt photons in the model reveals a limited influence when prompt photons are accompanied by fast scintillation (e.g., LSO:Ce:Ca) but a more significant effect when accompanied by slower scintillation (e.g., BGO). Establishing performance characteristics and limitations of prompt generating detectors is paramount to gauging and targeting the best possible timing capabilities they can offer.

TITLE: Deep Learning-Powered CT-Less Multitracer Organ Segmentation From PET Images: A Solution for Unreliable CT Segmentation in PET/CT Imaging

AUTHORS: Yazdan Salimi, Zahra Mansouri, Isaac Shiri, Ismini Mainta, Habib Zaidi

JOURNAL: Clinical nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: The common approach for organ segmentation in hybrid imaging relies on coregistered CT (CTAC) images. This method, however, presents several limitations in real clinical workflows where mismatch between PET and CT images are very common. Moreover, low-dose CTAC images have poor quality, thus challenging the segmentation task. Recent advances in CT-less PET imaging further highlight the necessity for an effective PET organ segmentation pipeline that does not rely on CT images. Therefore, the goal of this study was to develop a CT-less multitracer PET segmentation framework.

Patients and methods: We collected 2062 PET/CT images from multiple scanners. The patients were injected with either 18 F-FDG (1487) or 68 Ga-PSMA (575). PET/CT images with any kind of mismatch between PET and CT images were detected through visual assessment and excluded from our study. Multiple organs were delineated on CT components using previously trained in-house developed nnU-Net models. The segmentation masks were resampled to coregistered PET images and used to train 4 different deep learning models using different images as input, including noncorrected PET (PET-NC) and attenuation and scatter-corrected PET (PET-ASC) for 18 F-FDG (tasks 1 and 2, respectively using 22 organs) and PET-NC and PET-ASC for 68 Ga tracers (tasks 3 and 4, respectively, using 15 organs). The models' performance was evaluated in terms of Dice coefficient, Jaccard index, and segment volume difference.

Results: The average Dice coefficient over all organs was 0.81 ± 0.15, 0.82 ± 0.14, 0.77 ± 0.17, and 0.79 ± 0.16 for tasks 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. PET-ASC models outperformed PET-NC models ( P < 0.05) for most of organs. The highest Dice values were achieved for the brain (0.93 to 0.96 in all 4 tasks), whereas the lowest values were achieved for small organs, such as the adrenal glands. The trained models showed robust performance on dynamic noisy images as well.

Conclusions: Deep learning models allow high-performance multiorgan segmentation for 2 popular PET tracers without the use of CT information. These models may tackle the limitations of using CT segmentation in PET/CT image quantification, kinetic modeling, radiomics analysis, dosimetry, or any other tasks that require organ segmentation masks.

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear cardiology : official publication of the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Background: Activation of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) signaling protects against cardiac dysfunction and remodeling after myocardial infarction (MI). The aim of the study was to evaluate68Ga-NODAGA-exendin-4 positron emission tomography (PET) for assessment of GLP-1R expression after MI in rats.

Methods and results: Rats were studied at 3 days, 1 and 12 weeks after permanent coronary ligation or a sham-operation. Rats were injected with68Ga-NODAGA-exendin-4 and scanned with PET and contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) followed by digital autoradiography and histology of left ventricle tissue sections.68Ga-NODAGA-exendin-4 PET/CT showed focally increased tracer uptake in the infarcted regions peaking at 3 days and continuing at 1 week after MI. Pre-treatment with an unlabeled exendin-4 peptide significantly reduced68Ga-NODAGA-exendin-4 uptake. By autoradiography,68Ga-NODAGA-exendin-4 uptake was 8.6-fold higher in the infarcted region and slightly increased also in the remote, non-infarcted myocardium at 1 week and 12 weeks post-MI compared with sham. Uptake of68Ga-NODAGA-exendin-4 correlated with the amount of CD68-positive macrophages in the infarcted area and alpha-smooth muscle actin staining in the remote myocardium.

Conclusions: 68Ga-NODAGA-exendin-4 PET detects up-regulation of cardiac GLP-1R expression during healing of MI in rats and may provide information on the activated repair mechanisms after ischemic myocardial injury.

JOURNAL: Pharmaceutics

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Hypoxia is a complex microenvironmental condition known to regulate choline kinase α (CHKA) activity and choline transport through transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) and, therefore, may confound the uptake of choline radiotracer [18F]fluoromethyl-[1,2-2H4]-choline ([18F]-D4-FCH). The aim of this study was to investigate how hypoxia affects the choline radiotracer dynamics. Three underlying mechanisms by which hypoxia could potentially alter the uptake of the choline radiotracer, [18F]-D4-FCH, were investigated:18F-D4-FCH import, CHKA phosphorylation activity, and the efflux of [18F]-D4-FCH and its phosphorylated product [18F]-D4-FCHP. The effects of hypoxia on [18F]-D4-FCH uptake were studied in CHKA-overexpressing cell lines of prostate cancer, PC-3, and breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells. The mechanisms of radiotracer efflux were assessed by the cell uptake and immunofluorescence in vitro and examined in vivo (n= 24). The mathematical modelling methodology was further developed to verify the efflux hypothesis using [18F]-D4-FCH dynamic PET scans from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients (n= 17). We report a novel finding involving the export of phosphorylated [18F]-D4-FCH and [18F]-D4-FCHP via HIF-1α-responsive efflux transporters, including ABCB4, when the HIF-1α level is augmented. This is supported by a graphical analysis of human data with a compartmental model (M2T6k + k5) that accounts for the efflux. Hypoxia/HIF-1α increases the efflux of phosphorylated radiolabelled choline species, thus supporting the consideration of efflux in the modelling of radiotracer dynamics.

JOURNAL: Molecular pharmaceutics

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
(R)-[11C]verapamil is a radiotracer widely used for the evaluation of the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) function at the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Several studies have evaluated the pharmacokinetics of (R)-[11C]verapamil in rats and humans under different conditions. However, to the best of our knowledge, the pharmacokinetics of (R)-[11C]verapamil have not yet been evaluated in nonhuman primates. Our study aims to establish (R)-[11C]verapamil as a reference P-gp tracer for comparison of a newly developed P-gp positron emission tomography (PET) tracer in a species close to humans. Therefore, the study assesses the kinetics of (R)-[11C]verapamil and evaluates the effect of scan duration and P-gp inhibition on estimated pharmacokinetic parameters. Three nonhuman primates underwent two dynamic 91 min PET scans with arterial blood sampling, one at baseline and another after inhibition of the P-gp function. The (R)-[11C]verapamil data were analyzed using 1-tissue compartment model (1-TCM) and 2-tissue compartment model fits using plasma-corrected for polar radio-metabolites or non-corrected for radio-metabolites as an input function and with various scan durations (10, 20, 30, 60, and 91 min). The preferred model was chosen according to the Akaike information criterion and the standard errors (SE %) of the estimated parameters. 1-TCM was selected as the model of choice to analyze the (R)-[11C]verapamil data at baseline and after inhibition and for all scan durations tested. The volume of distribution (VT) and the efflux constantk2estimations were affected by the evaluated scan durations, whereas the influx constantK1estimations remained relatively constant. After P-gp inhibition (tariquidar, 8 mg/kg), in a 91 min scan duration, the whole-brainVTincreased significantly up to 208% (p< 0.001) andK1up to 159% (p< 0.001) compared with baseline scans. Thek2values decreased significantly after P-gp inhibition in all the scan durations except for the 91 min scans. This study suggests the use ofK1, calculated with 1-TCM and using short PET scans (10 to 30 min), as a suitable parameter to measure the P-gp function at the BBB of nonhuman primates.

TITLE: Enhanced high hydrostatic pressure lethality in acidulated raw pet food formulations was pathogen species and strain dependent

AUTHORS: Cristina Serra-Castelló, Aricia Possas, Anna Jofré, Margarita Garriga, Sara Bover-Cid

JOURNAL: Food microbiology

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Feeding dogs and cats with raw meat-based pet food is taking relevance in the recent years. The high awof these products together with the no cooking before its consumption by the animal pose a risk due to the potential occurrence and growth of foodborne pathogens. High pressure processing (HPP) is a non-thermal emerging technology that can be used as a lethality treatment to inactivate microorganisms with a minimum impact on the sensory and nutritional traits of the product. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the variability in pressure resistance of different strains of the relevant foodborne pathogens Salmonella spp., Escherichia coli and Listeria monocytogenes in raw pet food formulated without and with lactic acid. In general, Salmonella and L.monocytogenes strains showed a higher resistance to HPP than E. coli strains. In lactic acid acidulated formulations, the susceptibility to HPP of L. monocytogenes was markedly enhanced. The resistance to HPP was not only dependent on the microorganism but also on the strain. Thus, the selection of the proper strains should be taken into account when designing and validating the application of HPP as a control measure within the HACCP plan.

JOURNAL: Radiation oncology (London, England)

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Background: Stereotactic ablative radiation therapy (SABR) is effective in treating inoperable stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but imaging assessment of response after SABR is difficult. This prospective study aimed to develop a predictive model for true pathologic complete response (pCR) to SABR using imaging-based biomarkers from dynamic [18F]FDG-PET and CT Perfusion (CTP).

Methods: Twenty-six patients with early-stage NSCLC treated with SABR followed by surgical resection were included, as a pre-specified secondary analysis of a larger study. Dynamic [18F]FDG-PET and CTP were performed pre-SABR and 8-week post. Dynamic [18F]FDG-PET provided maximum and mean standardized uptake value (SUV) and kinetic parameters estimated using a previously developed flow-modified two-tissue compartment model while CTP measured blood flow, blood volume and vessel permeability surface product. Recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) was used to establish a predictive model with the measured PET and CTP imaging biomarkers for predicting pCR. The model was compared to current RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours version 1.1) and PERCIST (PET Response Criteria in Solid Tumours version 1.0) criteria.

Results: RPA identified three response groups based on tumour blood volume before SABR (BVpre-SABR) and change in SUVmax(ΔSUVmax), the thresholds being BVpre-SABR= 9.3 mL/100 g and ΔSUVmax= - 48.9%. The highest true pCR rate of 92% was observed in the group with BVpre-SABR< 9.3 mL/100 g and ΔSUVmax< - 48.9% after SABR while the worst was observed in the group with BVpre-SABR≥ 9.3 mL/100 g (0%). RPA model achieved excellent pCR prediction (Concordance: 0.92; P = 0.03). RECIST and PERCIST showed poor pCR prediction (Concordance: 0.54 and 0.58, respectively).

Conclusions: In this study, we developed a predictive model based on dynamic [18F]FDG-PET and CT Perfusion imaging that was significantly better than RECIST and PERCIST criteria to predict pCR of NSCLC to SABR. The model used BVpre-SABRand ΔSUVmaxwhich correlates to tumour microvessel density and cell proliferation, respectively and warrants validation with larger sample size studies.

TITLE: Individual dosimetry system for targeted alpha therapy based on PHITS coupled with microdosimetric kinetic model

AUTHORS: Tatsuhiko Sato, Takuya Furuta, Yuwei Liu, Sadahiro Naka, Shushi Nagamori, Yoshikatsu Kanai, Tadashi Watabe

JOURNAL: EJNMMI physics

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Background: An individual dosimetry system is essential for the evaluation of precise doses in nuclear medicine. The purpose of this study was to develop a system for calculating not only absorbed doses but also EQDX(α/β) from the PET-CT images of patients for targeted alpha therapy (TAT), considering the dose dependence of the relative biological effectiveness, the dose-rate effect, and the dose heterogeneity.

Methods: A general-purpose Monte Carlo particle transport code PHITS was employed as the dose calculation engine in the system, while the microdosimetric kinetic model was used for converting the absorbed dose to EQDX(α/β). PHITS input files for describing the geometry and source distribution of a patient are automatically created from PET-CT images, using newly developed modules of the radiotherapy package based on PHITS (RT-PHITS). We examined the performance of the system by calculating several organ doses using the PET-CT images of four healthy volunteers after injecting18F-NKO-035.

Results: The deposition energy map obtained from our system seems to be a blurred image of the corresponding PET data because annihilation γ-rays deposit their energies rather far from the source location. The calculated organ doses agree with the corresponding data obtained from OLINDA 2.0 within 20%, indicating the reliability of our developed system. Test calculations by replacing the labeled radionuclide from18F to211At suggest that large dose heterogeneity in a target volume is expected in TAT, resulting in a significant decrease of EQDX(α/β) for higher-activity injection.

Conclusions: As an extension of RT-PHITS, an individual dosimetry system for nuclear medicine was developed based on PHITS coupled with the microdosimetric kinetic model. It enables us to predict the therapeutic and side effects of TAT based on the clinical data largely available from conventional external radiotherapy.

TITLE: Arrival time mapping with 15O-gas PET for cerebrovascular steno-occlusive diseases: a comparative study with CT perfusion

AUTHORS: Masanobu Ibaraki, Yuki Shinohara, Aya Watanabe, Kaoru Sato, Tomomi Ohmura, Hiroyuki Yamamoto, Toshibumi Kinoshita

JOURNAL: EJNMMI research

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Background: Positron emission tomography (PET) with15O-gas for quantifying cerebral blood flow (CBF) and oxygen metabolism is the gold standard for assessing hemodynamics in ischemic cerebrovascular disease. However, conventional15O-gas PET methods do not provide information on regional arrival timing, a hemodynamic parameter typically measured using computed tomography (CT) perfusion with contrast media. This study demonstrated that15O-gas PET with a state-of-the-art clinical PET scanner and optimized analysis can generate arrival time maps. In this retrospective study of ten patients with unilateral stenosis or occlusion of the major arteries, we compared PET-derived arrival time maps with CT perfusion Tmax maps.

Results: In PET with short inhalation of [15O]-CO2gases, dynamic images were reconstructed with 2-sec temporal resolution, followed by weighted least-squares fitting of one-tissue compartment models, with or without the contributions from vascular components. PET arrival time maps were visually comparable to CT perfusion Tmax maps regarding the spatial extent of delayed brain regions, with less noise and higher image quality when using the model without the vascular components. Region-of-interest analyses showed good correlations between the two modalities: correlation coefficients of 0.834 for absolute values and 0.718 for ipsilateral-to-contralateral differences, respectively, indicating that15O-gas PET can quantitatively measure the arrival time with reasonable accuracy.

Conclusions: The present method generates arrival-time maps with15O-gas PET by applying optimized kinetic analysis to dynamic [15O]-CO2images acquired using a state-of-the-art, high-sensitivity clinical PET scanner. Additional arrival time information for conventional PET parameters of CBF and oxygen metabolism may facilitate a more comprehensive understanding of the hemodynamic status in cerebrovascular steno-occlusive diseases.

TITLE: Improving SUVR quantification by correcting for radiotracer clearance in tissue

AUTHORS: Praveen Honhar, David Matuskey, Richard E Carson, Ansel T Hillmer

JOURNAL: Journal of cerebral blood flow and metabolism : official journal of the International Society of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Standardized Uptake Value Ratio (SUVR) is a widely reported semi-quantitative positron emission tomography (PET) outcome measure, partly because of its ease of measurement from short scan durations. However, in brain,SUVRis often a biased estimator of the gold-standard distribution volume ratio (DVR) due to non-equilibrium conditions, i.e., clearance of the radiotracer in relevant tissues. Factors that affect radiotracer metabolism and clearance such as medication or subject groups could lead to artificial differences inSUVR. This work developed a correction that reduces the bias inSUVR(estimated from a short 15-30 min PET imaging session) by accounting for the effects of tracer clearance observed during the lateSUVRtime window. The proposed correction takes the form of a one-step non-linear algebraic transform ofSUVRthat is a function of radiotracer dependent parameters such as clearance rates from the reference and target tissues, and population averaged reference region clearance rate (). An important observation was the need for accurate estimation of radiotracer clearance rate in target tissue, which was addressed with a regression based model. Simulations and human data from two different radiotracers (healthy controls for [11C]LSN3172176, healthy controls and Parkinson's disease subjects for [18F]FE-PE2I) were used to validate the correction and evaluate its benefits and limitations.SUVRcorrection in human data significantly reduced meanSUVRbias across brain regions and subjects (from ∼25% forSUVRto <10% for correctedSUVR). This correction also significantly reduced the variability of this bias across brain regions for both tracers (approximately 50% for [11C]LSN3172176, 20% for [18F]FE-PE2I). Future work should investigate the benefits of using correctedSUVRin other populations and with different tracers.

ABSTRACT:
Introduction: P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is one of the most studied efflux transporters at the blood-brain barrier. It plays an important role in brain homeostasis by protecting the brain from a variety of endogenous and exogeneous substances. Changes in P-gp function are associated both with the onset of neuropsychiatric diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, and with drug-resistance, for example in treatment-resistant depression. The most widely used approach to measure P-gp function in vivo is (R)-[11C]verapamil PET. (R)-[11C]verapamil is, however, an avid P-gp substrate, which complicates the use of this tracer to measure an increase in P-gp function as its baseline uptake is already very low. [18F]MC225 was developed to measure both increases and decreases in P-gp function.

Aim: The aim of this study was (1) to identify the pharmacokinetic model that best describes [18F]MC225 kinetics in the human brain and (2) to determine test-retest variability.

Methods: Five (2 male, 3 female) of fourteen healthy subjects (8 male, 6 female, age 67 ± 5 years) were scanned twice (injected dose 201 ± 47 MBq) with a minimum interval of 2 weeks between scans. Each scanning session consisted of a 60-min dynamic [18F]MC225 scan with continuous arterial sampling. Whole brain grey matter data were fitted to a single tissue compartment model, and to reversible and irreversible two tissue-compartment models to obtain various outcome parameters (in particular the volume of distribution (VT), Ki, and the rate constants K1and k2). In addition, a reversible two-tissue compartment model with fixed k3/k4was included. The preferred model was selected based on the weighted Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) score. Test-retest variability (TRTV) was determined to assess reproducibility.

Results: Sixty minutes post-injection, the parent fraction was 63.8 ± 4.0%. The reversible two tissue compartment model corrected for plasma metabolites with an estimated blood volume (VB) showed the highest AIC weight score of 34.3 ± 17.6%. The TRVT of the VTfor [18F]MC225 PET scans was 28.3 ± 20.4% for the whole brain grey matter region using this preferred model.

Conclusion: [18F]MC225 VT, derived using a reversible two-tissue compartment model, is the preferred parameter to describe P-gp function in the human BBB. This outcome parameter has an average test-retest variability of 28%.

TITLE: PET Imaging of Sphingosine-1-Phosphate Receptor 1 with [18F]TZ4877 in Nonhuman Primates

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: The sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor-1 (S1PR1) is involved in regulating responses to neuroimmune stimuli. There is a need for S1PR1-specific radioligands with clinically suitable brain pharmcokinetic properties to complement existing radiotracers. This work evaluated a promising S1PR1radiotracer, [18F]TZ4877, in nonhuman primates.

Procedures: [18F]TZ4877 was produced via nucleophilic substitution of tosylate precursor with K[18F]/F-followed by deprotection. Brain PET imaging data were acquired with a Focus220 scanner in two Macaca mulatta (6, 13 years old) for 120-180 min following bolus injection of 118-163 MBq [18F]TZ4877, with arterial blood sampling and metabolite analysis to measure the parent input function and plasma free fraction (fP). Each animal was scanned at baseline, 15-18 min after 0.047-0.063 mg/kg of the S1PR1inhibitor ponesimod, 33 min after 0.4-0.8 mg/kg of the S1PR1-specific compound TZ82112, and 167-195 min after 1 ng/kg of the immune stimulus endotoxin. Kinetic analysis with metabolite-corrected input function was performed to estimate the free fraction corrected total distribution volume (VT/fP). Whole-body dosimetry scans were acquired in 2 animals (1M, 1F) with a Biograph Vision PET/CT System, and absorbed radiation dose estimates were calculated with OLINDA.

Results: [18F]TZ4877 exhibited fast kinetics that were described by the reversible 2-tissue compartment model. Baseline [18F]TZ4877 fPwas low (<1%), and [18F]TZ4877 VT/fPvalues were 233-866 mL/cm3. TZ82112 dose-dependently reduced [18F]TZ4877 VT/fP, while ponesimod and endotoxin exhibited negligible effects on VT/fP, possibly due to scan timing relative to dosing. Dosimetry studies identified the critical organs of gallbladder (0.42 (M) and 0.31 (F) mSv/MBq) for anesthetized nonhuman primate.

Conclusions: [18F]TZ4877 exhibits reversible kinetic properties, but the low fPvalue limits reproducible quantification with this radiotracer. S1PR1is a compelling PET imaging target, and these data support pursuing alternative F-18 labeled radiotracers for potential future human studies.

TITLE: Model selection for dynamic PET compartmental modelling of 18F-FDG uptake using a long axial field-of-view PET scanner with delay and motion correction

JOURNAL: EJNMMI research

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Background: In dynamic PET with tracer kinetic modeling, model complexity is an important but often under-recognised challenge affecting robust parameter estimation, particularly for noisy data. Traditional methods often neglect tissue heterogeneity and apply a single model universally. We applied a model selection approach alongside delay and motion correction, enabling the selection of models with varying complexity to better account for tissue heterogeneity.

Results: The study included five subjects with breast cancer undergoing dynamic18F-FDG PET imaging using a long axial field of view scanner. Voxel-wise kinetic model parameter estimation utilized five compartmental models, with the best model chosen using the Akaike Information Criterion. The model selection revealed diverse kinetic models within breast cancer lesions voxel-wise, with reduced parameter estimation variability attributed to the choice of simpler models. Applying delay and motion correction reduced the mean coefficient of variation in estimated kinetic parameters by 25%.

Conclusions: We applied a standard model selection approach to identify the optimal compartmental model for voxel-wise parameter estimation in long field-of-view dynamic PET imaging. Our results demonstrate that accounting for tissue heterogeneity in breast lesions is critical for accurate quantification. Additionally, delay and motion correction were shown to improve image quality, enhance quantification accuracy, and support more reliable model selection.

TITLE: [11C]5-Hydroxy-tryptophan model for quantitative assessment of in vivo serotonin biosynthesis, retention and degradation in the endocrine pancreas

AUTHORS: Mark Lubberink, Olof Eriksson

JOURNAL: American journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
[11C]5-Hydroxy-tryptophan ([11C]5-HTP) is a Positron Emission Tomography marker for serotonergic biosynthesis and degradation, with use in imaging of neuroendocrine tumors and recently also the endocrine pancreas in diabetes. In order to further develop [11C]5-HTP as a quantitative in vivo tool for understanding the mechanisms of serotonin signaling in human pancreas, we aimed to develop a kinetic modeling approach sensitive for changes in serotonin biosynthesis, retention and degradation. Cynomolgus monkeys were examined by [11C]5-HTP PET/CT, either at baseline (n=9) or following intravenous pretreatment with 3 mg/kg carbidopa (Dopa Decarboxylase inhibitor, n=3) or 2 mg/kg clorgyline (Monoamine Oxidase-A inhibitor, n=5). The dynamic tissue uptake was analysed by a 2-tissue compartment model including an efflux mechanism from the second tissue compartment (2TC kloss), which theoretically reproduces the known processing of 5-HTP in neuroendocrine cells. The 2TC klossmodel could accurately describe all three modes of tissue kinetics depending on the pretreatment regiment. Rate constant k3(corresponding to DDC activity) and the macro-parameter Flux (Ki) was decreased (P<0.05) by carbidopa pretreatment, while k2(corresponding to cellular washout of intact [11C]5-HTP) was increased (P<0.05). The efflux parameter kloss(corresponding to MAO-A activity) was decreased (P<0.05) by pretreatment of clorgyline, while the macro-parameter Flux/Efflux ratio (Ki/kloss) was increased (P<0.0001). We present a compartment model analysis method that can quantitatively assess in vivo pharmacological interactions with several of the key enzymatic steps of the serotonergic biosynthesis in pancreas.

ABSTRACT:
Functional Positron Emission Tomography (fPET) with (bolus plus) constant infusion of [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose FDG), known as fPET-FDG, is a recently introduced technique in human neuroimaging, enabling the detection of dynamic glucose metabolism changes within a single scan. However, the statistical analysis of fPET-FDG data remains challenging because its signal and noise characteristics differ from both classic bolus-administration FDG PET and from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), which together compose the primary sources of inspiration for analytical methods used by fPET-FDG researchers. In this study, we present an investigate of how inaccuracies in modeling baseline FDG uptake can introduce artifactual patterns to detrended TAC residuals, potentially introducing spurious (de)activations to general linear model (GLM) analyses. By combining simulations and empirical data from both constant infusion and bolus-plus-constant infusion protocols, we evaluate the effects of various baseline modeling methods, including polynomial detrending, regression against the global mean time-activity curve, and two analytical methods based on tissue compartment model kinetics. Our findings indicate that improper baseline removal can introduce statistically significant artifactual effects, although these effects characterized in this study (~2-8%) are generally smaller than those reported by previous literature employing robust sensory stimulation (~10-30%). We discuss potential strategies to mitigate this issue, including informed baseline modeling, optimized tracer administration protocols, and careful experimental design. These insights aim to enhance the reliability of fPET-FDG in capturing true metabolic dynamics in neuroimaging research.

ABSTRACT:
Huntington disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expanded polyglutamine (CAG) trinucleotide expansion in the huntingtin (HTT) gene that encodes the mutant huntingtin protein (mHTT). Visualization and quantification of cerebral mHTT will provide a proxy for target engagement and a means to evaluate therapeutic interventions aimed at lowering mHTT in the brain. Here, we validated the novel radioligand11C-labeled 6-(5-((5-methoxypyridin-2-yl)methoxy)benzo[d]oxazol-2-yl)-2-methylpyridazin-3(2H)-one (11C-CHDI-180R) using PET imaging to quantify cerebral mHTT aggregates in a macaque model of HD.Methods:Rhesus macaques received MRI-guided intrastriatal delivery of a mixture of AAV2 and AAV2.retro viral vectors expressing an HTT fragment bearing 85 CAG repeats (85Q,n= 5), a control HTT fragment bearing 10 CAG repeats (10Q,n= 4), or vector diluent only (phosphate-buffered saline,n= 5). Thirty months after surgery, 90-min dynamic PET/CT imaging was used to investigate11C-CHDI-180R brain kinetics, along with serial blood sampling to measure input function and stability of the radioligand. The total volume of distribution was calculated using a 2-tissue-compartment model as well as Logan graphical analysis for regional quantification. Immunostaining for mHTT was performed to corroborate the in vivo findings.Results:11C-CHDI-180R displayed good metabolic stability (51.4% ± 4.0% parent in plasma at 60 min after injection). Regional time-activity curves displayed rapid uptake and reversible binding, which were described by a 2-tissue-compartment model. Logan graphical analysis was associated with the 2-tissue-compartment model (r2= 0.96,P< 0.0001) and used to generate parametric volume of distribution maps. Compared with controls, animals administered the 85Q fragment exhibited significantly increased11C-CHDI-180R binding in several cortical and subcortical brain regions (group effect,P< 0.0001). No difference in11C-CHDI-180R binding was observed between buffer and 10Q animals. The presence of mHTT aggregates in the 85Q animals was confirmed histologically.Conclusion:We validated11C-CHDI-180R as a radioligand to visualize and quantify mHTT aggregated species in a HD macaque model. These findings corroborate our previous work in rodent HD models and show that11C-CHDI-180R is a promising tool to assess the mHTT aggregate load and the efficacy of therapeutic strategies.

TITLE: Striatal dopamine transporter and receptor availability correlate with relative cerebral blood flow measured with [11C]PE2I, [18F]FE-PE2I and [11C]raclopride PET in healthy individuals

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
The aim of this retrospective study was to investigate relationships between relative cerebral blood flow and striatal dopamine transporter and dopamine D2/3 availability in healthy subjects. The data comprised dynamic PET scans with two dopamine transporter tracers [11C]PE2I (n = 20) and [18F]FE-PE2I (n = 20) and the D2/3 tracer [11C]raclopride (n = 18). Subjects with a [11C]PE2I scan also underwent a dynamic scan with the serotonin transporter tracer [11C]DASB. Binding potential (BPND) and relative tracer delivery (R1) values were calculated on regional and voxel-level. Striatal R1and BPNDvalues were correlated, using either an MRI-based volume of interest (VOI) or an isocontour VOI based on the parametric BPNDimage. An inter-tracer comparison between [11C]PE2I BPNDand [11C]DASB R1was done on a VOI-level and simulations were performed to investigate whether the constraints of the modeling could cause correlation of the parameters. A positive association was found between BPNDand R1for all three dopamine tracers. A similar correlation was found for the inter-tracer correlation between [11C]PE2I BPNDand [11C]DASB R1. Simulations showed that this relationship was not caused by cross-correlation between parameters in the kinetic model. In conclusion, these results suggest an association between resting-state striatal dopamine function and relative blood flow in healthy subjects.

TITLE: Comparison of parametric imaging and SUV imaging with [68 Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 using dynamic total-body PET/CT in prostate cancer

AUTHORS: Ruohua Chen, Yee Ling Ng, Xinlan Yang, Yinjie Zhu, Lianghua Li, Haitao Zhao, Yun Zhou, Gang Huang, Jianjun Liu

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Standardized uptake value (SUV) has been prevalently used to measure [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 activity in prostate cancer, but it is susceptible to multiple factors. Parametric imaging allows for absolute quantification of tracer uptake and provides a better diagnostic accuracy that is crucial for lesion detection. However, the clinical significance of total-body parametric imaging of [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 remains to be fully assessed. Therefore, the aim of our study is to delve into the diagnostic implications of total-body parametric imaging of [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT for patients with prostate cancer.

Methods: Twenty prostate cancer patients were included and underwent a dynamic total-body [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT scan. An irreversible two-tissue compartment model (2T3k) was fitted for each tissue time-to-activity curve, and the net influx rate (Ki) was obtained. The image quality and semi-quantitative analysis of lesion-to-background ratio (LBR), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) were compared between parametric images and SUV images.

Results: Kinetic modeling using 2T3k demonstrated favorable model fitting in both normal organs and lesions. All of the lesions detected on SUV images (55-60 min) could be detected on Kiimages. The correlation between Ki, SUVmean,and SUVmaxin both normal organs and pathological lesions was found to be positive and statistically significant. Conversely, a moderate positive correlations were found between Kiand K1(R = 0.69, P < 0.001; R = 0.61, P < 0.001) and Kiand k3(R = 0.69, P < 0.001; R = 0.62, P < 0.001), in normal organs and pathological lesions, respectively. Visual assessment in Kiimages showed less image noise and higher lesions conspicuity compared to SUV images. Kiimage-derived LBR, SNR, and CBR of pathological lesions including primary tumors (PTs), lymph node metastases (LNMs) and bone metastases (BMs), exhibited remarkably higher folds (1.4-3.6 folds) compared to those derived from SUV of corresponding lesions.

Conclusions: Total-body parametric imaging of [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 enhanced lesion contrast and improved lesion detectability compared to SUV images. This may potentially serve as an imaging biomarker and theranostic tool for precise diagnosis and treatment evaluation in prostate cancer patients.

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: In locally advanced p16+ oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC), (i) to investigate kinetics of human papillomavirus (HPV) circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and association with tumor progression after chemoradiation, and (ii) to compare the predictive value of ctDNA to imaging biomarkers of MRI and FDG-PET.

Experimental design: Serial blood samples were collected from patients with AJCC8 stage III OPSCC (n= 34) enrolled on a randomized trial: pretreatment; during chemoradiation at weeks 2, 4, and 7; and posttreatment. All patients also had dynamic-contrast-enhanced and diffusion-weighted MRI, as well as FDG-PET scans pre-chemoradiation and week 2 during chemoradiation. ctDNA values were analyzed for prediction of freedom from progression (FFP), and correlations with aggressive tumor subvolumes with low blood volume (TVLBV) and low apparent diffusion coefficient (TVLADC), and metabolic tumor volume (MTV) using Cox proportional hazards model and Spearman rank correlation.

Results: Low pretreatment ctDNA and an early increase in ctDNA at week 2 compared with baseline were significantly associated with superior FFP (P< 0.02 andP< 0.05, respectively). At week 4 or 7, neither ctDNA counts nor clearance were significantly predictive of progression (P= 0.8). Pretreatment ctDNA values were significantly correlated with nodal TVLBV, TVLADC, and MTV pre-chemoradiation (P< 0.03), while the ctDNA values at week 2 were correlated with these imaging metrics in primary tumor. Multivariate analysis showed that ctDNA and the imaging metrics performed comparably to predict FFP.

Conclusions: Early ctDNA kinetics during definitive chemoradiation may predict therapy response in stage III OPSCC.

TITLE: A deep learning method for total-body dynamic PET imaging with dual-time-window protocols

AUTHORS: Wenxiang Ding, Hanzhong Wang, Xiaoya Qiao, Biao Li, Qiu Huang

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Prolonged scanning durations are one of the primary barriers to the widespread clinical adoption of dynamic Positron Emission Tomography (PET). In this paper, we developed a deep learning algorithm that capable of predicting dynamic images from dual-time-window protocols, thereby shortening the scanning time.

Methods: This study includes 70 patients (mean age ± standard deviation, 53.61 ± 13.53 years; 32 males) diagnosed with pulmonary nodules or breast nodules between 2022 to 2024. Each patient underwent a 65-min dynamic total-body [18F]FDG PET/CT scan. Acquisitions using early-stop protocols and dual-time-window protocols were simulated to reduce the scanning time. To predict the missing frames, we developed a bidirectional sequence-to-sequence model with attention mechanism (Bi-AT-Seq2Seq); and then compared the model with unidirectional or non-attentional models in terms of Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Bias, Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), and Structural Similarity (SSIM) of predicted frames. Furthermore, we reported the comparison of concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) of the kinetic parameters between the proposed method and traditional methods.

Results: The Bi-AT-Seq2Seq significantly outperform unidirectional or non-attentional models in terms of MAE, Bias, PSNR, and SSIM. Using a dual-time-window protocol, which includes a 10-min early scan followed by a 5-min late scan, improves the four metrics of predicted dynamic images by 37.31%, 36.24%, 7.10%, and 0.014% respectively, compared to the early-stop protocol with a 15-min acquisition. The CCCs of tumor' kinetic parameters estimated with recovered full time-activity-curves (TACs) is higher than those with abbreviated TACs.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm can accurately generate a complete dynamic acquisition (65 min) from dual-time-window protocols (10 + 5 min).

TITLE: Quantitation of multiple injection dynamic PET scans: an investigation of the benefits of pooling data from separate scans when mapping kinetics

AUTHORS: Fengyun Gu, Finbarr O'Sullivan, Mark Muzi, David A Mankoff

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Multiple injection dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) scanning is used in the clinical management of certain groups of patients and in medical research. The analysis of these studies can be approached in two ways: (i) separate analysis of data from individual tracer injections, or (ii), concatenate/pool data from separate injections and carry out a combined analysis. The simplicity of separate analysis has some practical appeal but may not be statistically efficient. We use a linear model framework associated with a kinetic mapping scheme to develop a simplified theoretical understanding of separate and combined analysis. The theoretical framework is explored numerically using both 1D and 2D simulation models. These studies are motivated by the breast cancer flow-metabolism mismatch studies involving15O-water (H2O) and18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and repeat15O-H2O injections used in brain activation investigations. Numerical results are found to be substantially in line with the simple theoretical analysis: mean square error characteristics of alternative methods are well described by factors involving the local voxel-level resolution of the imaging data, the relative activities of the individual scans and the number of separate injections involved. While voxel-level resolution has dependence on scan dose, after adjustment for this effect, the impact of a combined analysis is understood in simple terms associated with the linear model used for kinetic mapping. This is true for both data reconstructed by direct filtered backprojection or iterative maximum likelihood. The proposed analysis has potential to be applied to the emerging long axial field-of-view PET scanners.

ABSTRACT:
The textile industry is an important economic sector; however, its wastewater generates a great impact on the environment. A heterogeneous solar Fenton (HSF) process was evaluated for denim wastewater treatment. The catalyst was obtained through ultrasonic modification of recycled polyethylene terephthalate (PET) with Fe nanoparticles (PET/NPs- Fe3O4). The SFH process was optimized using surface response methodology with a face-centered central composite design considering the effects of the hydraulic retention time (10, 25, and 40 min), hydrogen peroxide dosage (500, 1000, and 1500 mg/L), and mass of the packed catalyst (4, 6 and 8 g) on the color, COD, and turbidity removal efficiencies. The operating conditions for maximum COD removal were H2O2541.7 mg/L, HRT 33.9 min, and PET/NPs- Fe3O4dose 7.9 g with solar radiation. The removal of 91.2% COD, 86.2% color, 90.4% turbidity, and 81.9% TOC was obtained at 14.2 kJ/L QUva. PET modification yielded 1.6 mg Fe/g PET, and the modification method does not allow Fe leaching. The effluent obtained from the SFH process complies with the maximum permissible limits in Mexican legislation in terms of COD, TOC, turbidity, and color and allows the reuse of PET.

AUTHORS: Tutukhanim Balayeva, Ruth H Asch, Peng Wen Tan, William Mennie, Jie Tong, Baosheng Chen, Zhenwu Zhuang, Chao Zheng, MingQiang Zheng, Takuya Toyonaga, Zhengxin Cai

JOURNAL: Nuclear medicine and biology

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Alterations in synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A) are linked to various neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with radiotracers targeting SV2A, such as [18F]SynVesT-1, has proven effective for monitoring these changes. However, SV2A PET quantification using kinetic modeling requires radiometabolite analysis, which presents challenges, particularly in preclinical longitudinal studies due to the relatively large sample volume required by the standard radio-high-performance liquid chromatography (radio-HPLC) method. This study aimed to evaluate radio-thin layer chromatography combined with autoradiography (radio-TLC/AR) as an alternative to radio-HPLC in rat plasma radiometabolite analysis.

Methods: All rats received intravenous infusions of [18F]SynVesT-1. Arterial blood samples were collected at predetermined time points for up to 60 min post injection. [18F]SynVesT-1 radiometabolites in plasma and brain were assessed using both radio-HPLC and radio-TLC/AR.

Results: We observed a decline in [18F]SynVesT-1 plasma concentrations within the first 5 min post-injection. The parent fractions obtained by the radio-HPLC method significantly correlated with those obtained using radio-TLC/AR (R2= 0.99, p < 0.0001). While radio-HPLC detected minimal radiometabolites in the brain (1.34 % ± 0.83 %, n = 4), these radiometabolites were not identifiable in selected brain regions using the radio-TLC/AR method (n = 1).

Conclusion: We were able to reliably evaluate the parent fractions of [18F]SynVesT-1 in plasma over a 60-min period using normal-phase radio-TLC/AR as an alternative to radio-HPLC. This approach requires less plasma and is less time-consuming with high reproducibility. Future studies will focus on applying this radio-TLC/AR method for metabolism correction of input functions, in the quantitative analysis of PET imaging data using kinetic modeling.

ABSTRACT:
Introduction: Subcritical epileptiform activity is associated with impaired cognitive function and is commonly seen in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The anti-convulsant, levetiracetam (LEV), is currently being evaluated in clinical trials for its ability to reduce epileptiform activity and improve cognitive function in AD. The purpose of the current study was to apply pharmacokinetics (PK), network analysis of medical imaging, gene transcriptomics, and PK/PD modeling to a cohort of amyloidogenic mice to establish how LEV restores or drives alterations in the brain networks of mice in a dose-dependent basis using the rigorous preclinical pipeline of the MODEL-AD Preclinical Testing Core.

Methods: Chronic LEV was administered to 5XFAD mice of both sexes for 3 months based on allometrically scaled clinical dose levels from PK models. Data collection and analysis consisted of a multi-modal approach utilizing18F-FDG PET/MRI imaging and analysis, transcriptomic analyses, and PK/PD modeling.

Results: Pharmacokinetics of LEV showed a sex and dose dependence in Cmax, CL/F, and AUC0-∞, with simulations used to estimate dose regimens. Chronic dosing at 10, 30, and 56 mg/kg, showed18F-FDG specific regional differences in brain uptake, and in whole brain covariance measures such as clustering coefficient, degree, network density, and connection strength (i.e. positive and negative). In addition, transcriptomic analysis via nanoString showed dose-dependent changes in gene expression in pathways consistent18F-FDG uptake and network changes, and PK/PD modeling showed a concentration dependence for key genes, but not for network covariance modeling.

Discussion: This study represents the first report detailing the relationships of metabolic covariance and transcriptomic network changes resulting from LEV administration in 5XFAD mice. Overall, our results highlight non-linear kinetics based on dose and sex, where gene expression analysis demonstrated LEV dose- and concentration- dependent changes, along with cerebral metabolism, and/or cerebral homeostatic mechanisms relevant to human AD, which aligned closely with network covariance analysis of18F-FDG images. Collectively, this study show cases the value of a multimodal connectomic, transcriptomic, and pharmacokinetic approach to further investigate dose dependent relationships in preclinical studies, with translational value towards informing clinical study design.

TITLE: Quantitative evaluation of hepatic integrin αvβ3 expression by positron emission tomography imaging using 18F-FPP-RGD2 in rats with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis

AUTHORS: Shuichi Hiroyama, Takemi Rokugawa, Miwa Ito, Hitoshi Iimori, Ippei Morita, Hiroki Maeda, Kae Fujisawa, Keiko Matsunaga, Eku Shimosegawa, Kohji Abe

JOURNAL: EJNMMI research

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Background: Integrin αvβ3, which are expressed by activated hepatic stellate cells in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), play an important role in the fibrosis. Recently, we reported that an RGD peptide positron emission tomography (PET) probe is useful as a predictor of hepatic fibrosis. Kinetic analysis of the RGD PET probe has been performed in tumours, but not in hepatic fibrosis. Therefore, we aimed to quantify hepatic integrin αvβ3in a model of NASH by kinetic analysis using18F-FPP-RGD2, an integrin αvβ3PET probe.

Methods: 18F-FPP-RGD2PET/CT scans were performed in control and NASH rats. Tissue kinetic analyses were performed using a one-tissue, two-compartment (1T2C) and a two-tissue, three-compartment (2T3C) model using an image-derived input function (IDIF) for the left ventricle. We then conducted correlation analysis between standard uptake values (SUVs) or volume of distribution (VT), evaluated using compartment kinetic analysis and integrin αvor β3protein expression.

Results: Biochemical and histological evaluation confirmed the development of NASH rats. Integrin αvβ3protein expression and hepatic SUV were higher in NASH- than normal rats. The hepatic activity of18F-FPP-RGD2peaked rapidly after administration and then gradually decreased, whereas left ventricular activity rapidly disappeared. The 2T3C model was found to be preferable for18F-FPP-RGD2kinetic analysis in the liver. The VT (IDIF)for18F-FPP-RGD2, calculated using the 2T3C model, was significantly higher in NASH- than normal rats and correlated strongly with hepatic integrin αvand β3protein expression. The strengths of these correlations were similar to those between SUV60-90 minand hepatic integrin αvor β3protein expression.

Conclusions: We have demonstrated that the VT (IDIF)of18F-FPP-RGD2, calculated using kinetic modelling, positively correlates with integrin αvand β3protein in the liver of NASH rats. These findings suggest that hepatic VT (IDIF)provides a quantitative assessment of integrin αvβ3protein in liver.

TITLE: Catalytic Pyrolysis of PET Polymer Using Nonisothermal Thermogravimetric Analysis Data: Kinetics and Artificial Neural Networks Studies

AUTHORS: Ibrahim Dubdub, Zaid Alhulaybi

JOURNAL: Polymers

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
This paper presents the catalytic pyrolysis of a constant-composition mixture of zeolite β and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) polymer by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) at different heating rates (2, 5, 10, and 20 K/min). The thermograms showed only one main reaction and shifted to higher temperatures with increasing heating rate. In addition, at constant heating rate, they moved to lower temperatures of pure PET pyrolysis when a catalyst was added. Four isoconversional models, namely, Kissinger−Akahira−Sunose (KAS), Friedman, Flynn−Wall−Qzawa (FWO), and Starink, were applied to obtain the activation energy (Ea). Values of Ea acquired by these models were very close to each other with average value of Ea = 154.0 kJ/mol, which was much lower than that for pure PET pyrolysis. The Coats−Redfern and Criado methods were employed to set the most convenient solid-state reaction mechanism. These methods revealed that the experimental data matched those obtained by different mechanisms depending on the heating rate. Values of Ea obtained by these two models were within the average values of 157 kJ/mol. An artificial neural network (ANN) was utilized to predict the remaining weight fraction using two input variables (temperature and heating rate). The results proved that ANN could predict the experimental value very efficiently (R2 > 0.999) even with new data.

TITLE: Aluminum Fluoride-18 Labeled Mannosylated Dextran: Radiosynthesis and Initial Preclinical Positron Emission Tomography Studies

AUTHORS: Putri Andriana, Konstantina Makrypidi, Heidi Liljenbäck, Johan Rajander, Antti Saraste, Ioannis Pirmettis, Anne Roivainen, Xiang-Guo Li

JOURNAL: Molecular imaging and biology

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: In addition to being expressed on liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, mannose receptors are also found on antigen-presenting cells, including macrophages, which are mainly involved in the inflammation process. Dextran derivatives of various sizes containing cysteine and mannose moieties have previously been labeled with99mTc and used for single-photon emission computed tomography imaging of sentinel lymph nodes. In this study, we radiolabeled 21.3-kDa D10CM with positron-emitting18F for initial positron emission tomography (PET) studies in rats.

Procedures: D10CM was conjugated with 1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1,4,7-triacetic acid (NOTA) chelator and radiolabeled with the aluminum fluoride-18 method. The whole-body distribution kinetics and stability of the intravenously administered tracer were studied in healthy male Sprague-Dawley rats by in vivo PET/CT imaging, ex vivo gamma counting, and high-performance liquid chromatography analysis.

Results: Al[18F]F-NOTA-D10CM was obtained with a radiochemical purity of >99% and molar activity of 9.9 GBq/μmol. At 60 minutes after injection, an average of 84% of the intact tracer was found in the blood, indicating excellent in vivo stability. The highest radioactivity concentration was seen in the liver, spleen, and bone marrow, in which mannose receptors are highly expressed under physiological conditions. The uptake specificity was confirmed with in vivo blocking experiments.

Conclusions: Our results imply that Al[18F]F-NOTA-D10CM is a suitable tracer for PET imaging. Further studies in disease models with mannose receptor CD206-positive macrophages are warranted to clarify the tracer's potential for imaging of inflammation.

TITLE: Brain delivery enabled by transient blood-brain barrier disruption induced by regadenoson: a PET imaging study

AUTHORS: Benoit Hosten, Sébastien Goutal, Sarah Leterrier, Cassandre Corvo, Louise Breuil, Olivier Barret, Simon Specklin, Charles Truillet, Nicolas Tournier

JOURNAL: Expert opinion on drug delivery

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Background: Regadenoson, an agonist of adenosine A2 receptors, enables transient blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption. The relevance of regadenoson as a pharmacological strategy for brain delivery was investigated using in vivo PET imaging in rats.

Research design and methods: Kinetic modeling of brain PET data was performed to estimate the impact of regadenoson (0.05 mg.kg-1, i.v.) on BBB permeation compared with control rats (n= 4-6 per group). Three radiolabeled compounds of different sizes, which do not cross the intact BBB, were tested.

Results: Regadenoson significantly increased the BBB penetration (+116 ± 13%,p< 0.001) of [18F]2-deoxy-2-fluoro-D-sorbitol ([18F]FDS, MW = 183 Da), a small-molecule marker of BBB permeability. The magnitude of the effect was different across brain regions, with a maximum increase in the striatum. Recovery of BBB integrity was observed 30 min after regadenoson injection. Regadenoson also increased the brain penetration (+72 ± 45%,p< 0.05) of a radiolabeled nanoparticle [89Zr]AGuIX (MW = 9 kDa). However, the brain kinetics of a monoclonal antibody ([89Zr]mAb, MW = 150 kDa) remained unchanged (p> 0.05).

Conclusions: PET imaging showed the features and limitations of BBB disruption induced by regadenoson in terms of extent, regional distribution, and reversibility. Nevertheless, regadenoson enables the brain delivery of small molecules or nanoparticles in rats.

TITLE: Spatiotemporal learning of dynamic positron emission tomography data improves diagnostic accuracy in breast cancer

AUTHORS: Marianna Inglese, Andrea Duggento, Tommaso Boccato, Matteo Ferrante, Nicola Toschi

JOURNAL: Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society. IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society. Annual International Conference

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Positron emission tomography (PET) can reveal metabolic activity in a voxelwise manner. PET analysis is commonly performed in a static manner by analyzing the standardized uptake value (SUV) obtained from the plateau region of PET acquisitions. A dynamic PET acquisition can provide a map of the spatiotemporal concentration of the tracer in vivo, hence conveying information about radiotracer delivery to tissue, its interaction with the target and washout. Therefore, tissue-specific biochemical properties are embedded in the shape of time activity curves (TACs), which are generally used for kinetic analysis. Conventionally, TACs are employed along with information about blood plasma activity concentration, i.e., the arterial input function (AIF), and specific compartmental models to obtain a full quantitative analysis of PET data. The main drawback of this approach is the need for invasive procedures requiring arterial blood sample collection during the whole PET scan. In this paper, we address the challenge of improving PET diagnostic accuracy through an alternative approach based on the analysis of time signal intensity patterns. Specifically, we demonstrate the diagnostic potential of tissue TACs provided by dynamic PET acquisition using various deep learning models. Our framework is shown to outperform the discriminative potential of classical SUV analysis, hence paving the way for more accurate PET-based lesion discrimination without additional acquisition time or invasive procedures. Clinical Relevance- The diagnostic accuracy of dynamic PET data exploited by deep-learning based time signal intensity pattern analysis is superior to that of static SUV imaging.

TITLE: Non-invasive arterial input function estimation using an MRA atlas and machine learning

AUTHORS: Rajat Vashistha, Hamed Moradi, Amanda Hammond, Kieran O'Brien, Axel Rominger, Hasan Sari, Kuangyu Shi, Viktor Vegh, David Reutens

JOURNAL: EJNMMI research

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Background: Quantifying biological parameters of interest through dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) requires an arterial input function (AIF) conventionally obtained from arterial blood samples. The AIF can also be non-invasively estimated from blood pools in PET images, often identified using co-registered MRI images. Deploying methods without blood sampling or the use of MRI generally requires total body PET systems with a long axial field-of-view (LAFOV) that includes a large cardiovascular blood pool. However, the number of such systems in clinical use is currently much smaller than that of short axial field-of-view (SAFOV) scanners. We propose a data-driven approach for AIF estimation for SAFOV PET scanners, which is non-invasive and does not require MRI or blood sampling using brain PET scans. The proposed method was validated using dynamic18F-fluorodeoxyglucose [18F]FDG total body PET data from 10 subjects. A variational inference-based machine learning approach was employed to correct for peak activity. The prior was estimated using a probabilistic vascular MRI atlas, registered to each subject's PET image to identify cerebral arteries in the brain.

Results: The estimated AIF using brain PET images (IDIF-Brain) was compared to that obtained using data from the descending aorta of the heart (IDIF-DA). Kinetic rate constants (K1, k2, k3) and net radiotracer influx (Ki) for both cases were computed and compared. Qualitatively, the shape of IDIF-Brain matched that of IDIF-DA, capturing information on both the peak and tail of the AIF. The area under the curve (AUC) of IDIF-Brain and IDIF-DA were similar, with an average relative error of 9%. The mean Pearson correlations between kinetic parameters (K1, k2, k3) estimated with IDIF-DA and IDIF-Brain for each voxel were between 0.92 and 0.99 in all subjects, and for Ki, it was above 0.97.

Conclusion: This study introduces a new approach for AIF estimation in dynamic PET using brain PET images, a probabilistic vascular atlas, and machine learning techniques. The findings demonstrate the feasibility of non-invasive and subject-specific AIF estimation for SAFOV scanners.

ABSTRACT:
This study synthesises expanded graphite (EG) from graphitised carbon from waste polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles. The adsorbent material was characterised using FTIR, XRF, XRD, SEM, Raman Spectroscopy, and BET surface area analysis. The synthesised EG defluorinated wastewater, utilising response surface methodology (RSM) for experimental design and optimisation. XRD patterns confirmed the successful synthesis of graphite and EG, demonstrating structural modifications. Raman spectra indicated higher crystalline order in EG, with D and G band shifts and an increased ID/IGintensity ratio from 0.89-1.04. BET analysis revealed a specific surface area of 247.1 m²/g. . FTIR analysis showed abundant functional groups, particularly hydroxyl (-OH) and alkene (C = C). Batch adsorption experiments revealed that fluoride adsorption onto EG depended on pH, time, and initial fluoride concentration. Optimal conditions for fluoride removal, determined using RSM with central composite design (CCD), demonstrated a maximum fluoride removal rate of 97%. Isotherm data fitted both Langmuir and Freundlich model, and kinetics data aligned well with the pseudo-first-order model. ANOVA showed significant effects of contact time, pH, adsorbent dose, and initial fluoride concentration on removal efficiency. The model's R² value of 0.98 and lack of fit value of 0.1554 confirmed the quality of the second-order polynomial model. Optimal conditions for maximum fluoride removal efficiency of 97% were validated at 5 mg/L fluoride concentration, pH 4, adsorbent dose of 5 g/L, and a contact time of 30 min. Therefore, the present study demonstrated efficient fluoride-polluted water treatment using waste-derived EG.

ABSTRACT:
The kinetic analysis of [Formula: see text]-FET time-activity curves (TAC) can provide valuable diagnostic information in glioma patients. The analysis is most often limited to the average TAC over a large tissue volume and is normally assessed by visual inspection or by evaluating the time-to-peak and linear slope during the late uptake phase. Here, we derived and validated a linearized model for TACs of [Formula: see text]-FET in dynamic PET scans. Emphasis was put on the robustness of the numerical parameters and how reliably automatic voxel-wise analysis of TAC kinetics was possible. The diagnostic performance of the extracted shape parameters for the discrimination between isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) wildtype (wt) and IDH-mutant (mut) glioma was assessed by receiver-operating characteristic in a group of 33 adult glioma patients. A high agreement between the adjusted model and measured TACs could be obtained and relative, estimated parameter uncertainties were small. The best differentiation between IDH-wt and IDH-mut gliomas was achieved with the linearized model fitted to the averaged TAC values from dynamic FET PET data in the time interval 4-50 min p.i.. When limiting the acquisition time to 20-40 min p.i., classification accuracy was only slightly lower (-3%) and was comparable to classification based on linear fits in this time interval. Voxel-wise fitting was possible within a computation time ≈ 1 min per image slice. Parameter uncertainties smaller than 80% for all fits with the linearized model were achieved. The agreement of best-fit parameters when comparing voxel-wise fits and fits of averaged TACs was very high (p < 0.001).

JOURNAL: Theranostics

ABSTRACT:
Amino acid utilization is perturbed in cancer cells, which rewire their metabolism to support cell survival and proliferation. This metabolic reprogramming can be exploited for diagnostic purposes through positron emission tomography imaging of fluorine-18 labeled amino acids. Despite its promise, little is known regarding transporter-recognition of non-natural amino acid stereoisomers or their utility for cancer imaging. We report here the synthesis andin vivocharacterization of a radiolabeled amino acid (R)-4-(3-18F-fluoropropyl)-ʟ-glutamate ([18F]FRPG) and compared its tumor imaging properties to the 4S-isomer, [18F]FSPG.[18F]FRPG and [18F]FSPG uptake was assessed in H460 lung cancer cells, with efflux measured 30 min after removal of exogenous activity. Specificity of [18F]FRPG for system xC-was further examined following transporter inhibition and blocking studies with system xC-substrates. [18F]FRPG and [18F]FSPG pharmacokinetics was next quantified in mice bearing subcutaneous A549, H460, VCAP and PC3 tumors, with mice bearing A549 tumors imaged by PET/CT. To better-understand differential tumor retention, radiometabolite analysis was performed on tissue and blood samples after imaging. Next, [18F]FRPG and [18F]FSPG retention in lipopolysaccharide-treated lungs were compared to an orthotopic H460 lung cancer model. Finally, the sensitivity of [18F]FRPG to manipulation of the redox environment was examined in cell andin vivomodels.[18F]FRPG was specifically transported across the plasma membrane by the cystine/glutamate antiporter system xC-and retained at high levels in multiple tumor models. Conversely, [18F]FRPG was rapidly extracted from the blood and cleared from tissues with low system xC-expression. Due to its favorable imaging properties, tumor-to-blood ratios ≥10 were achieved with [18F]FRPG, which were either equal to or greater than [18F]FSPG. In addition, [18F]FRPG retention in orthotopic lung tumors with high system xC-expression was 2.5-fold higher than inflamed tissue, allowing for clear tumor visualization.In vivo, [18F]FRPG and [18F]FSPG were metabolized to a single species, with [18F]FRPG showing a higher percentage of parent radiotracer in tumors compared to [18F]FSPG. [18F]FRPG was sensitive to redox manipulations and tumor retention was reduced following treatment with liposomal doxorubicin in mice bearing ovarian tumors.Given the fast clearance and low background retention of [18F]FRPG throughout the body, this radiotracer holds promise for the imaging of system xC-activity and treatment response monitoring in tumors of the thorax, abdomen, and head and neck. [18F]FRPG PET imaging provides a sensitive noninvasive measure of system xC-and excellent properties for cancer imaging.

TITLE: Transport characteristics of fragmental polyethylene glycol terephthalate (PET) microplastics in porous media under various chemical conditions

AUTHORS: Shunan Dong, Jihong Xia, Liting Sheng, Weimu Wang, Hui Liu, Bin Gao

JOURNAL: Chemosphere

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Transport characteristics of fragmental polyethylene glycol terephthalate (PET) microplastics in porous media were elucidated via column experiments under a series combination of electrolytes, pH, and humic acid (HA) conditions. Fragmental PET microplastics showed low mobility in porous media with a small mass recovery rate (<50.1%) even under unfavorable retention conditions. The electrolyte, pH, and HA showed combined impact on PET microplastic transport. PET microplastics mobility was enhanced with decreasing electrolyte concentration, increasing pH, and increasing HA concentration. Basic properties (e.g. destiny and shape) of PET microplastics showed stronger effect on their transport behaviors in porous media rather than the experimental chemical conditions. In general, both environmental factors and basic properties played important roles in controlling the retention and transport of PET microplastics in porous media. A numerical model considering the second order kinetic deposition sites was applied to depict the retention and transport of PET microplastics in porous media. Model simulations well matched the experimental breakthrough curves. Given the fragmental PET microplastics have more realistic and irregular shapes, results from this study can improve present knowledge of the environmental fate and risk of microplastics in underground soil and water systems.

TITLE: [11C]mHED PET follows a two-tissue compartment model in mouse myocardium with norepinephrine transporter (NET)-dependent uptake, while [18F]LMI1195 uptake is NET-independent

AUTHORS: Linjing Mu, Stefanie D Krämer, Geoffrey I Warnock, Achi Haider, Susan Bengs, Giovanni Cartolano, Dominic S Bräm, Claudia Keller, Roger Schibli, Simon M Ametamey, Philipp A Kaufmann, Catherine Gebhard

JOURNAL: EJNMMI research

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Clinical positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of the presynaptic norepinephrine transporter (NET) function provides valuable diagnostic information on sympathetic outflow and neuronal status. As data on the NET-targeting PET tracers [11C]meta-hydroxyephedrine ([11C]mHED) and [18F]LMI1195 ([18F]flubrobenguane) in murine experimental models are scarce or lacking, we performed a detailed characterization of their myocardial uptake pattern and investigated [11C]mHED uptake by kinetic modelling.

Methods: [11C]mHED and [18F]LMI1195 accumulation in the heart was studied by PET/CT in FVB/N mice. To test for specific uptake by NET, desipramine, a selective NET inhibitor, was administered by intraperitoneal injection. [11C]mHED kinetic modelling with input function from an arteriovenous shunt was performed in three mice.

Results: Both tracers accumulated in the mouse myocardium; however, only [11C]mHED uptake was significantly reduced by excess amount of desipramine. Myocardial [11C]mHED uptake was half-saturated at 88.3 nmol/kg of combined mHED and metaraminol residual. After [11C]mHED injection, a radiometabolite was detected in plasma and urine, but not in the myocardium. [11C]mHED kinetics followed serial two-tissue compartment models with desipramine-sensitive K1.

Conclusion: PET with [11C]mHED but not [18F]LMI1195 provides information on NET function in the mouse heart. [11C]mHED PET is dose-independent in the mouse myocardium at < 10 nmol/kg of combined mHED and metaraminol. [11C]mHED kinetics followed serial two-tissue compartment models with K1representing NET transport. Myocardial [11C]mHED uptake obtained from PET images may be used to assess cardiac sympathetic integrity in mouse models of cardiovascular disease.

TITLE: Preliminary protocol for measuring the reproducibility and accuracy of flow values on digital PET/CT systems in [15O]H2O myocardial perfusion imaging using a flow phantom

AUTHORS: Reetta Siekkinen, Heidi Partanen, Linda Kukola, Tuula Tolvanen, Andrew Fenwick, Nadia A S Smith, Mika Teräs, Antti Saraste, Jarmo Teuho

JOURNAL: EJNMMI physics

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Background: Several factors may decrease the accuracy of quantitative PET myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI). It is therefore essential to ensure that myocardial blood flow (MBF) values are reproducible and accurate, and to design systematic protocols to achieve this. Until now, no systematic phantom protocols have been available to assess the technical factors affecting measurement accuracy and reproducibility in MPI.

Materials and methods: We implemented a standard measurement protocol, which applies a flow phantom in order to compare image-derived flow values with respect to a ground truth flow value with [15O]H2O MPI performed on both a Discovery MI (DMI-20, GE Healthcare) and a Biograph Vision 600 (Vision-600, Siemens Healthineers) system. Both systems have automatic [15O]H2O radio water generators (Hidex Oy) individually installed, allowing us to also study the differences occurring due to two different bolus delivery systems. To investigate the technical factors contributing to the modelled flow values, we extracted the [15O]H2O bolus profiles, the flow values from the kinetic modeling (Qin and Qout), and finally calculated their differences between test-retest measurements on both systems.

Results: The measurements performed on the DMI-20 system produced Qin and Qout values corresponging to each other as well as to the reference flow value across all test-retest measurements. The repeatability differences on DMI-20 were 2.1% ± 2.6% and 3.3% ± 4.1% for Qin and Qout, respectively. On Vision-600 they were 10% ± 8.4% and 11% ± 10% for Qin and Qout, respectively. The measurements performed on the Vision-600 system showed more variation between Qin and Qout values across test-retest measurements and exceeded 15% difference in 7/24 of the measurements.

Conclusions: A preliminary protocol for measuring the accuracy and reproducibility of flow values in [15O]H2O MPI between digital PET/CT systems was assessed. The test-retest reproducibility falls below 15% in majority of the measurements conducted between two individual injector systems and two digital PET/CT systems. This study highlights the importance of implementing a standardized bolus injection and delivery protocol and importance of assessing technical factors affecting flow value reproducibility, which should be carefully investigated in a multi-center setting.

TITLE: Comparison of adsorption capacity of 4-Nonylphenol on conventional and biodegradable microplastics aged under natural water

AUTHORS: Fallon Nacaratte, Anahi Valdivia, Sylvia V Copaja

JOURNAL: Journal of contaminant hydrology

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
This study investigated the adsorption of 4-Nonylphenol (4-NP) on aged microplastics (MPs) composed of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and poly(butylene-adipate-co-terephthalate)/polylactic acid (PBAT/PLA). Morphological analysis revealed wear, wrinkles, and increased surface roughness in both aged MPs, with X-ray diffraction showing slight increases in crystallinity. Infrared spectroscopy showed an increase in the carbonyl index from 2.78 to 4.37 for PBAT/PLA and 0.51 to 2.32 for PET after aging. The natural water from the San Pedro River in Chile Atacama region (5.91 mS·cm-1conductivity, 3.25 PSU salinity, 2955 mg·L-1total dissolved solids, 435 mg·L-1CaCO3hardness) was used as the environmental medium and compared with a 0.01 mol·L-1CaCl2as a model solution. Kinetic modeling showed a decrease in 4-NP percentage removal from 90.0 % (2277 μg∙g-1adsorption capacity) to 50.2 % (1268 μg∙g-1) for PET and from 86.8 % (2087 μg∙g-1) to 70.3 % (1955 μg∙g-1) for PBAT/PLA when comparing the model solution to natural water, with 30 and 84 h equilibrium times, respectively. Isotherm data showed that 4-NP/PET fits BET n-layer and Temkin models, while 4-NP-PBAT/PLA fits the Toth and Hill models The ionic composition of natural water induces cation attraction to polarized MPs surfaces, intensifying competition for adsorption sites. This involves ion and molecular cooperation, 4-NP reorientation, external diffusion effects, and surface oxidation variations, which are attributed to explaining the bilayer (PET) and monolayer (PBAT/PLA) formation. This work contributes to understanding MP pollution and the importance of considering the bioplastics life cycle, since their waste presents significant potential to resist external factors for transporting contaminants.

ABSTRACT:
Dye-contaminated water and waste plastic both pose enormous threats to human health and the ecological environment, and simultaneously solving these two issues in a sustainable and resource-saving way is highly important. In this work, a sodium alginate-polyethylene terephthalate-sodium alginate (SA@PET) composite adsorbent for efficient dye removal is fabricated using wasted PET bottle and marine plant-based SA via simple and energy-efficient nonsolvent-induced phase separation (NIPS) method. Benefiting from its porous structure and the abundant binding sites, SA@PET shows an excellent methylene blue (MB) adsorption capacity of 1081 mg g-1. The Redlich-Peterson model more accurately describes the adsorption behavior, suggesting multiple adsorption mechanisms. In addition to the electrostatic attractions of SA to MB, polar interactions between the PET matrix and MB are also identified as adsorption mechanisms. It is worth mentioning that SA@PET could be recycled 7 times without a serious decrease in performance, and the trifluoroacetic acid-dichloromethane solvent involved in the NIPS process has the possibility of reuse and stepwise recovery. Finally, the discarded adsorbent could be completely degraded under mild conditions. This work provides not only a composite adsorbent with excellent cationic dye removal performance for wastewater treatment, but also an upcycling strategy for waste PET.

TITLE: Adsorption of bisphenol A by activated carbon developed from PET waste by KOH activation

AUTHORS: Vicente Gómez-Serrano, Marta Adame-Pereira, María Alexandre-Franco, Carmen Fernández-González

JOURNAL: Environmental science and pollution research international

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
This study deals with the preparation of activated carbon (AC) from poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) waste and with the physicochemical characterization of AC and its use as adsorbent of bisphenol A (BPA) in aqueous solution. AC was prepared by chemical activation with KOH and by physical activation in steam. The activation with KOH was carried out by impregnation first of PET by wet and dry routes at the PET/KOH weight ratios of 1:1, 1:3, and 1:5 and by carbonization then of the resulting products at 850 °C for 2 h in N2atmosphere. The activation in steam was performed by heating at 900 °C for 1 h. The ACs were characterized by N2adsorption at - 196 °C, mercury porosity, mercury density measurements, FT-IR spectroscopy, and measurement of pH of the point of zero charge (pHpzc). The activation yield is 58.4-49.4% with KOH in aqueous solution, 75.8-23.9% with solid KOH, and 5.9% with steam. Using solid KOH, greater developments of a more heterogeneous porosity with increasing impregnation PET/KOH ratio are achieved. For SK1:5, SBETis 1990 m2g-1and the pore volumes are 0.71 cm3g-1, micropores; 0.81 cm3g-1, mesopores; and 1.77 cm3g-1, macropores. The data of BPA adsorption fit better to the Ho and Mckay second order kinetic model than to the Lagergren first-order kinetic model and to the Langmuir equation than to the Freundlich equation. From the kinetic and thermodynamic standpoints, the adsorption process of BPA is more favorable for SK1:5.

TITLE: Measuring hypoxia in chronic limb-threatening ischemia using 18F-FAZA kinetic modelling - a pilot study

AUTHORS: Adam Farag, Andres Kohan, Tetsuro Sekine, Seyed Ali Mirshahvalad, Ur Metser, Sebastian Mafeld, Kongteng Tan, Patrick Veit-Haibach

JOURNAL: EJNMMI research

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Background: Chronic limb- threatening ischemia (CLTI) is a serious condition that can lead to amputation, and in some cases, it can be associated with mortality. Current clinical evaluation methods have several limitations. Therefore, new methods to assess CLTI are needed to better understand and measure underlying causes and functionality, and hence potentially improve the treatment. In this study, we use dynamic18F-FAZA PET-imaging as a method of measuring hypoxia as a marker associated with CLTI, on twelve patients identified with CLTI who underwent18F-FAZA PET-MR imaging.

Results: The kinetic modelling goodness-of-fit metrics using AIF from independent limb with the irreversible-2TC3K model distinguished between index and contralateral limbs better than the reversable-2TC4K model. The Spearman correlation coefficients between the standardized uptake value (SUV) SUV-to-SUVmedratio and the perfusion parameter, [Formula: see text], was rs= -0.07 for index and rs= 0.22 for contralateral limbs. For the SUV-to-SUVmedratio correlation with diffusion parameter, [Formula: see text], it is found to be negative for both index (rs= -0.16) and contralateral (rs= -0.11).

Conclusions: The kinetic modelling of18F-FAZA dynamic PET-MR was able to differentiate between index and contralateral limbs in CLTI patients, and the diffusion metric from the kinetic modelling can potentially be used as a metric to measure hypoxia in CLTI.

TITLE: Automated Total-Body Perfusion Imaging with 15O-Water PET Using Basis Functions and Organ-Specific Model Selection

AUTHORS: Anna Åhlström, Elin Lindström, Teemu Maaniitty, Hidehiro Iida, Henri Kärpijoki, Jens Sörensen, Juhani Knuuti, Mark Lubberink

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Long-axial-field-of-view PET with15O-water allows perfusion to be measured in the whole body simultaneously. The purpose of this work was to describe a method for automated computation of total-body parametric perfusion images using PET information only and to validate the perfusion and volume of distribution (VT) values obtained by comparing them with the gold standard (nonlinear regression analysis).Methods:Data from 10 subjects at Turku PET Centre were evaluated. Each subject underwent a 4-min 40-s dynamic PET/CT scan starting simultaneously with a controlled bolus administration of 350 MBq of15O-water. Arterial and venous blood curves were defined using cluster analysis. Delay correction was performed by down-sampling the PET volume, using nonlinear regression for estimation of the delay for each subvolume, interpolation of delay values to the original matrix, and delay correction of all voxel time-activity curves, allowing for linearization of the model. Total-body perfusion images were calculated using several basis function implementations of the single-tissue-compartment model, considering the variations in blood supply to different organs. Model selection for each voxel was performed using cluster analysis to identify different organs. Perfusion andVTvalues based on the automated parametric imaging method were validated by comparison of mean organ values with nonlinear regression of the appropriate compartment models to whole-organ time-activity curves.Results:The results showed good agreement between the parameters achieved from the automated parametric images and nonlinear regression. Correlation (R2) and agreement between linear and nonlinear analyses were high, with anR2of 0.99 for both perfusion andVT, with a slope of 0.98 and 1.01 for perfusion andVT, respectively.Conclusion:Perfusion andVTvalues based on automated total-body parametric analysis agreed well with those based on nonlinear regression of whole-organ time-activity curves.

TITLE: Pharmacokinetic studies of [68 Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 in patients with biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer: detection, differences in temporal distribution and kinetic modelling by tissue type

AUTHORS: Dimitrios S Strauss, C Sachpekidis, K Kopka, L Pan, U Haberkorn, A Dimitrakopoulou-Strauss

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 is a promising radiopharmaceutical for detecting tumour lesions in prostate cancer, but knowledge of the pharmacokinetics is limited. Dynamic PET-CT was performed to investigate the tumour detection and differences in temporal distribution, as well as in kinetic modelling of [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 by tissue type.

Methods: Dynamic PET-CT over the lower abdomen and static whole-body PET-CT 80-90 min p.i. from 142 patients with biochemical recurrence were retrospectively analysed. Detection rates were compared to PSA levels. Average time-activity curves were calculated from tumour lesions and normal tissue. A three-compartment model and non-compartment model were used to calculate tumour kinetics.

Results: Overall detection rate was 70.42%, and in patients with PSA > 0.4 ng/mL 76.67%. All tumour lesions presented the steepest standardised uptake value (SUV) incline in the first 7-8 min before decreasing to different degrees. Normal tissue presented with a low uptake, except for the bladder, which accumulated activity the steepest 15-16 min. p.i.. While all tumour lesions continuously increased, bone metastases showed the steepest decline, resulting in a significantly lower SUV than lymph node metastases (60 and 80-90 min). Transport rate from the blood and tracer binding and internalisation rate were lower in bone metastases. Heterogeneity (fractal dimension) and vascular density were significantly lower in bone metastases.

Conclusion: Even at low PSA between 0.51 and 0.99 ng/mL, detection rate was 57%. Dynamic imaging showed a time window in the first 10 min where tumour uptake is high, but no bladder activity is measured, aiding accuracy in distinction of local recurrence. Kinetic modelling provided additional information for tumour characterisation by tissue type.

TITLE: New improved radiometabolite analysis method for [18F]FTHA from human plasma: a test-retest study with postprandial and fasting state

AUTHORS: Richard Aarnio, Anna Kirjavainen, Johan Rajander, Sarita Forsback, Kari Kalliokoski, Pirjo Nuutila, Zvonko Milicevic, Tamer Coskun, Axel Haupt, Iina Laitinen, Merja Haaparanta-Solin

JOURNAL: EJNMMI research

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Background: Fatty acid uptake can be measured using PET and 14-(R,S)-[18F]fluoro-6-thia-heptadecanoic acid ([18F]FTHA). However, the relatively rapid rate of [18F]FTHA metabolism significantly affects kinetic modeling of tissue uptake. Thus, there is a need for accurate chromatographic methods to analyze the unmetabolized [18F]FTHA (parent fraction). Here we present a new radiometabolite analysis (RMA) method, with comparison to a previous method for parent fraction analysis, and its use in a test-retest clinical study under fasting and postprandial conditions. We developed a new thin-layer chromatography (TLC) RMA method for analysis of [18F]FTHA parent fraction and its radiometabolites from plasma, by testing stationary phases and eluent combinations. Next, we analyzed [18F]FTHA, its radiometabolites, and plasma radioactivity from subjects participating in a clinical study. A total of 17 obese or overweight participants were dosed with [18F]FTHA twice under fasting, and twice under postprandial conditions and plasma samples were obtained between 14 min (mean of first sample) and 72 min (mean of last sample) post-injection. Aliquots of 70 plasma samples were analyzed using both methods, enabling head-to-head comparisons. We performed test-retest and group comparisons of the parent fraction and plasma radioactivity.

Results: The new TLC method separated seven [18F]FTHA radiometabolite peaks, while the previous method separated three. The new method revealed at least one radiometabolite that was not previously separable from [18F]FTHA. From the plasma samples, the mean parent fraction value was on average 7.2 percentage points lower with the new method, compared to the previous method. Repeated [18F]FTHA investigations on the same subject revealed reproducible plasma SUV and parent fractions, with different kinetics between the fasted and postprandial conditions.

Conclusions: The newly developed improved radio-TLC method for [18F]FTHA RMA enables accurate parent fraction correction, which is required to obtain quantitative data for modelling [18F]FTHA PET data. Our test-retest study of fasted and postprandial conditions showed robust reproducibility, and revealed clear differences in the [18F]FTHA metabolic rate under different study settings.

TITLE: Detecting and classifying neurotransmitter signals from ultra-high sensitivity PET data: the future of molecular brain imaging

AUTHORS: Heather Liu, Evan D Morris

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Efforts to build the next generation of brain PET scanners are underway. It is expected that a new scanner (NS) will offer anorder-of-magnitude improvementin sensitivity to counts compared to the current state-of-the-art, Siemens HRRT. Our goal was to explore the use of the anticipated increased sensitivity in combination with the linear-parametric neurotransmitter PET (lp-ntPET) model to improve detection and classification of transient dopamine (DA) signals. We simulated striatal [11C]raclopride PET data to be acquired on a future NS which will offer ten times the sensitivity of the HRRT. The simulated PET curves included the effects of DA signals that varied in start-times, peak-times, and amplitudes. We assessed the detection sensitivity of lp-ntPET to various shapes of DA signal. We evaluated classification thresholds for their ability to separate 'early'- versus 'late'-peaking, and 'low'- versus 'high'-amplitude events in a 4D phantom. To further refine the characterization of DA signals, we developed a weighted k-nearest neighbors (wkNN) algorithm to incorporate information from the neighborhood around each voxel to reclassify it, with a level of certainty. Our findings indicate that the NS would expand the range of detectable neurotransmitter events to 72%, compared to the HRRT (31%). Application of wkNN augmented the detection sensitivity to DA signals in simulated NS data to 92%. This work demonstrates that the ultra-high sensitivity expected from a new generation of brain PET scanner, combined with a novel classification algorithm, will make it possible to accurately detect and classify short-lived DA signals in the brain based on their amplitude and timing.

AUTHORS: Kirill A Kirshanov, Roman V Toms, Gadir Sh Aliev, Daniil A Ismaylov, Natalya Yu Shagina, Pavel V Sokolovskiy, Guliya R Nizameeva, Alexander Yu Gervald

JOURNAL: Polymers

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Interchain exchange, proceeded by the transesterification mechanism, allows one to obtain polyethylene terephthalate-based polyester products, bypassing the stage of molecular weight reduction and polycondensation used in classical methods of chemical recycling. A kinetic model is presented, which describes the change in the concentrations of bound and terminal units of ethylene glycol from PET and glycol from another polyester, as well as free molecules of ethylene glycol and another glycol, during transesterification reactions for the first time. Experimental data on the dependence of the degree of randomness and conversion on timeduring the interaction of polyethylene terephthalate and oligodiethylene terephthalate with terminal hydroxyl groups with a number-average molecular weight of 860 g/mol in different ratios were obtained. Molecular weight characteristics of the products of PET and oligoesters with hydroxyl end group interchain exchange, with number-average molecular weights from 610 to 860 g/mol, were also investigated. The simulation results were also compared with published data on the dependence of the degree of randomness and conversion on time during ether exchange in PET/PEN blends. The developed kinetic model was found to be in agreement with the experimental data.

ABSTRACT:
Systems vaccinology has been applied to detect signatures of human vaccine induced immunity but its ability, together with high definitionin vivoclinical imaging is not established to predict vaccine reactogenicity. Within two European Commission funded high impact programs, BIOVACSAFE and ADITEC, we applied high resolution positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scanning using tissue-specific and non-specific radioligands together with transcriptomic analysis of muscle biopsies in a clinical model systematically and prospectively comparing vaccine-induced immune/inflammatory responses. 109 male participants received a single immunization with licensed preparations of either AS04-adjuvanted hepatitis B virus vaccine (AHBVV); MF59C-adjuvanted (ATIV) or unadjuvanted seasonal trivalent influenza vaccine (STIV); or alum-OMV-meningococcal B protein vaccine (4CMenB), followed by a PET/CT scan (n = 54) or an injection site muscle biopsy (n = 45). Characteristic kinetics was observed with a localized intramuscular focus associated with increased tissue glycolysis at the site of immunization detected by18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/CT, peaking after 1-3 days and strongest and most prolonged after 4CMenB, which correlated with clinical experience. Draining lymph node activation peaked between days 3-5 and was most prominent after ATIV. Well defined uptake of the immune cell-binding radioligand11C-PBR28 was observed in muscle lesions and draining lymph nodes. Kinetics of muscle gene expression module upregulation reflected those seen previously in preclinical models with a very early (~6hrs) upregulation of monocyte-, TLR- and cytokine/chemokine-associated modules after AHBVV, in contrast to a response on day 3 after ATIV, which was bracketed by whole blood responses on day 1 as antigen presenting, inflammatory and innate immune cells trafficked to the site of immunization, and on day 5 associated with activated CD4+ T cells. These observations confirm the use of PET/CT, including potentially tissue-, cell-, or cytokine/chemokine-specific radioligands, is a safe and ethical quantitative technique to compare candidate vaccine formulations and could be safely combined with biopsy to guide efficient collection of samples for integrated whole blood and tissue systems vaccinology in small-scale but intensive human clinical models of immunization and to accelerate clinical development and optimisation of vaccine candidates, adjuvants, and formulations.

TITLE: Sorption and desorption of petroleum hydrocarbons on biodegradable and nondegradable microplastics

AUTHORS: Xiaowei Song, Xiaofeng Wu, Xiaoping Song, Cuijie Shi, Zhengdong Zhang

JOURNAL: Chemosphere

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Both biodegradable and nondegradable plastics are widely used. However, their interactions with petroleum hydrocarbons (PHs) have not been sufficiently studied. In this study, a type of biodegradable [polylactic acid (PLA)] and five types of nondegradable microplastics [polyamide (PA), polyethylene (PE), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polystyrene (PS), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC)] were selected to investigate the sorption and desorption mechanisms of PHs. The sorption kinetics of the six types of microplastics followed a pseudo-second-order kinetics model (R2ranged from 0.956 to 0.999) and indicated that chemical sorption dominated the sorption process. The key rate-controlling steps of the sorption of PHs on microplastics were intraparticle diffusion and liquid film diffusion. The sorption capacity of PHs on microplastics followed the order of PA > PE > PS > PET > PLA > PVC. The difference in sorption capacity might be due to the crystallinity, and rubber or glass state of the microplastics. In addition, all types of microplastics exhibited reversible sorption without noticeable desorption hysteresis. No obvious differences were observed in the sorption and desorption of PHs between biodegradable and nondegradable microplastics. Both biodegradable and nondegradable microplastics could sorb/desorb PHs and serve as transportation vectors.

TITLE: Preclinical evaluation of [18F]cabozantinib as a PET imaging agent in a prostate cancer mouse model

AUTHORS: Vegard Torp Lien, Sofie Celen, Syed Nuruddin, Bala Attili, Gilles Doumont, Gaetan Van Simaeys, Guy Bormans, Jo Klaveness, Dag Erlend Olberg

JOURNAL: Nuclear medicine and biology

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Introduction: Cabozantinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) approved for the treatment of medullary thyroid cancer, renal cell carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma, and is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of prostate cancer and others. It exerts its therapeutic effect mainly through inhibition of the tyrosine kinases MET (hepatocyte growth factor receptor) and VEGFR2 (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2), in addition to several other kinases involved in cancer. PET imaging with TKIs such as [18F]cabozantinib could potentially aid in cancer diagnosis and guide treatment. This study aims to evaluate the utility of [18F]cabozantinib as a PET imaging probe in PC3 tumor xenografted mice.

Methods: [18F]cabozantinib was evaluated in non-tumor and tumor bearing (PC3 xenografted) male mice by ex vivo biodistribution studies and in vivo μPET imaging. Pretreatment studies were performed in the tumor bearing mice with the MET inhibitor PF04217903. Mouse plasma was analyzed with HPLC to quantify radiometabolites. To further evaluate the binding specificity of [18F]cabozantinib, in vitro autoradiography studies on heart and PC3 tumor sections were performed in the presence of authentic cabozantinib or specific MET and VEGFR2 inhibitors.

Results: Tissue distribution studies in non-tumor bearing mice revealed slow blood clearance, absence of brain uptake and a high myocardial uptake. In the tumor bearing mice, tumor uptake was low (0.58 ± 0.20% ID/g at 30 min post tracer injection), which was confirmed by μPET imaging. No differences in tissue distribution and kinetics were observed in both biodistributions and μPET studies after pretreatment with the MET inhibitor PF04217903. At 30 min post tracer injection, 60 ± 3% of the recovered radioactivity in plasma in non-tumor bearing mice was present as intact tracer. [18F]cabozantinib binding in vitro to heart and tumor tissues was partly blocked in the presence of selective MET and VEGFR2 inhibitors (up to 40% block). The fraction of non-specific binding was relatively high for both tissues (66% for heart and 39% for tumor).

Conclusion: [18F]cabozantinib exhibits non-favorable properties as a PET imaging probe, demonstrated by slow excretion kinetics along with low tumor uptake and high non-specific binding in tumor and heart tissue. The results reflect cabozantinibs multi-kinase activity, making PET imaging of tumor specific kinase expression with [18F]cabozantinib challenging.

TITLE: Upcycling of waste polyethylene terephthalate plastic bottles into porous carbon for CF4 adsorption

AUTHORS: Xiangzhou Yuan, Moon-Kyung Cho, Jong Gyu Lee, Seung Wan Choi, Ki Bong Lee

JOURNAL: Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Thermo-chemical processes for converting plastic wastes into useful materials are considered promising technologies to mitigate the environmental pollution caused by plastic wastes. In this study, polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic wastes were used to develop cost-effective and value-added porous carbons; the developed porous carbons were subsequently tested for capturing CF4, a greenhouse gas with a high global-warming potential. The activation temperature was varied from 600 °C to 1000 °C and the mass ratio of KOH/carbon ranged from 1 to 3 in the preparation process and their effects on the textural properties and CF4-capture performance of the PET plastic waste-derived porous carbons were investigated. The CF4-adsorption uptake was dictated by the specific surface area and pore volume of narrow micropores less than 0.9 nm in diameter. PET-K(2)700, which was developed by KOH activation at 700 °C and KOH/carbon mass ratio of 2, showed the highest CF4-adsorption uptake of 2.43 mmol g-1at 25 °C and 1 atm. Also, the CF4-adsorption data were fitted well with the Langmuir isotherm model and pseudo second-order kinetic model. The PET plastic waste-derived porous carbons exhibited a high CF4uptake, good CF4/N2selectivity at relatively low CF4pressures, easy regeneration, rapid adsorption/desorption kinetics, and excellent recyclability, which are promising for practical CF4-capture applications.

JOURNAL: Journal of imaging

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
This study aims to evaluate non-invasive PET quantification methods for (R)-[11C]PK11195 uptake measurement in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and healthy controls (HC) in comparison with arterial input function (AIF) using dynamic (R)-[11C]PK11195 PET and magnetic resonance images. The total volume of distribution (VT) and distribution volume ratio (DVR) were measured in the gray matter, white matter, caudate nucleus, putamen, pallidum, thalamus, cerebellum, and brainstem using AIF, the image-derived input function (IDIF) from the carotid arteries, and pseudo-reference regions from supervised clustering analysis (SVCA). Uptake differences between MS and HC groups were tested using statistical tests adjusted for age and sex, and correlations between the results from the different quantification methods were also analyzed. Significant DVR differences were observed in the gray matter, white matter, putamen, pallidum, thalamus, and brainstem of MS patients when compared to the HC group. Also, strong correlations were found in DVR values between non-invasive methods and AIF (0.928 for IDIF and 0.975 for SVCA,p< 0.0001). On the other hand, (R)-[11C]PK11195 uptake could not be differentiated between MS patients and HC using VT values, and a weak correlation (0.356,p< 0.0001) was found between VTAIFand VTIDIF. Our study shows that the best alternative for AIF is using SVCA for reference region modeling, in addition to a cautious and appropriate methodology.

TITLE: Interface adsorption characteristics of microplastics on multiple morphological arsenic compounds

AUTHORS: Di Zhang, Jingxi Li, Chengjun Sun, Corry Yanti Manullang, Jiaxuan Yin, Wei Cao, Fenghua Jiang

JOURNAL: Journal of hazardous materials

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Polystyrene (PS) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) are commonly used materials that degrade into microplastics in the environment. These microplastics, possessing unique physical properties, can adsorb pollutants and contribute to composite pollution effects. This study examined the loading characteristics and toxic effects of PS and PET on six arsenic compounds, revealing that PS and PET displayed different adsorption capacities for these compounds, with PS demonstrating high adsorption for monomethylarsonic acid (MMA). The adsorption kinetics and isotherm analyses indicated that arsenic compounds quickly reached equilibrium on PS and PET. The kinetics were effectively described by pseudo-first-order models, and the isotherms aligned with the Langmuir and Freundlich models. Furthermore, simulated gastric fluid (SGF) and simulated intestinal fluid (SIF) were used to desorb arsenic compounds bound to PS and PET. The effects of aging, pH, salinity, anions, and humic acid (HA) on the ability of inorganic arsenic (iAs) to bind to PS and PET were analyzed. The results indicated that aging and HA increased the adsorption capacity of the microplastics, while salinity, anions, and elevated pH negatively affected this capacity. Additionally, the influence of microplastics and iAs on the clearance of free radicals by reduced glutathione (GSH) was explored. Microplastics inhibited the clearance of 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) by GSH, whereas iAs, especially arsenate, facilitated this process, likely due to synergistic effects with the oxidized form of GSH generated through GSH reactions. This study offers a theoretical foundation for understanding how microplastics transport various forms of arsenic compounds and their potential environmental risks.

TITLE: Enhanced adsorption of diclofenac onto activated carbon derived from PET plastic by one-step pyrolysis with KOH

AUTHORS: Yunhai Zhang, Qing Ma, Zihao Chen, Yuexiao Shi, Sirui Chen, Yongjun Zhang

JOURNAL: Environmental science and pollution research international

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Plastic pollution is a severe threat to the health of ecosystems, and recycling plastics is recognized as a key control strategy. This study used the one-step pyrolysis assisted with KOH activation to recycle the widely used polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic as activated carbon (PET-AC) which was subsequently applied to adsorb diclofenac (DCF), a frequently detected emerging contaminant in water, for the first time. It was found that both the pyrolysis temperature and the addition of KOH can effectively regulate the pore sizes and volumes of PET-AC. PET-AC obtained at 700 °C demonstrated a high adsorption capacity of DCF up to 179.42 mg g-1at 45 °C. The adsorption kinetics was conducted with both static jar and dynamic column tests and analyzed with various models. Thermodynamic results demonstrated that the adsorption of DCF was spontaneous and endothermic. The material also presented an excellent potential to adsorb other pharmaceuticals and personal care products in water. XPS and FTIR analysis indicated that the adsorption might be mainly driven by the physical forces, especially π-π interaction and hydrogen bonding. This study provided a reference for recycling waste plastic as an efficient adsorbent to eliminate organic contaminants from water.

TITLE: Rapid Online Analysis of Photopolymerization Kinetics and Molecular Weight Using Diffusion NMR

AUTHORS: Lucy L Fillbrook, Mitchell D Nothling, Martina H Stenzel, William S Price, Jonathon E Beves

JOURNAL: ACS macro letters

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Online, high-throughput molecular weight analysis of polymerizations is rare, with most studies relying on tedious sampling techniques and batchwise postanalysis. The ability to track both monomer conversion and molecular weight evolution in real time could underpin precision polymer development and facilitate study of rapid polymerization reactions. Here, we use a single time-resolved diffusion nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiment to simultaneously study the kinetics and molecular weight evolution during a photopolymerization, with in situ irradiation inside the NMR instrument. As a model system, we used a photoinduced electron transfer reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (PET-RAFT) polymerization. The data allow diffusion coefficients and intensities to be calculated every 14 s from which the polymer size and monomer conversion can be extracted. Key to this approach is (1) the use of shuffled gradient amplitudes in the diffusion NMR experiment to access reactions of any rate, (2) the addition of a relaxation agent to increase achievable time resolution and, (3) a sliding correction that accounts for viscosity changes during polymerization. Diffusion NMR offers a uniquely simple, translatable handle for online monitoring of polymerization reactions.

TITLE: Exploration of Imaging Biomarkers for Metabolically-Targeted Osteosarcoma Therapy in a Murine Xenograft Model

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Background:Osteosarcoma (OS) is an aggressive pediatric cancer with unmet therapeutic needs. Glutaminase 1 (GLS1) inhibition, alone and in combination with metformin, disrupts the bioenergetic demands of tumor progression and metastasis, showing promise for clinical translation.Materials and Methods:Three positron emission tomography (PET) clinical imaging agents, [18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-2-D-glucose ([18F]FDG), 3'-[18F]fluoro-3'-deoxythymidine ([18F]FLT), and (2S, 4R)-4-[18F]fluoroglutamine ([18F]GLN), were evaluated in the MG63.3 human OS xenograft mouse model, as companion imaging biomarkers after treatment for 7 d with a selective GLS1 inhibitor (CB-839, telaglenastat) and metformin, alone and in combination. Imaging and biodistribution data were collected from tumors and reference tissues before and after treatment.Results:Drug treatment altered tumor uptake of all three PET agents. Relative [18F]FDG uptake decreased significantly after telaglenastat treatment, but not within control and metformin-only groups. [18F]FLT tumor uptake appears to be negatively affected by tumor size. Evidence of a flare effect was seen with [18F]FLT imaging after treatment. Telaglenastat had a broad influence on [18F]GLN uptake in tumor and normal tissues.Conclusions:Image-based tumor volume quantification is recommended for this paratibial tumor model. The performance of [18F]FLT and [18F]GLN was affected by tumor size. [18F]FDG may be useful in detecting telaglenastat's impact on glycolysis. Exploration of kinetic tracer uptake protocols is needed to define clinically relevant patterns of [18F]GLN uptake in patients receiving telaglenastat.

TITLE: Crystallization of Bis(2-hydroxyethylene) Terephthalate as a Part of a Bottle-to-Bottle Recycling Concept for Poly(ethylene terephthalate)

AUTHORS: Guido Grause, Joseph Sutton, Andrew P Dove, Niall A Mitchell, Joseph Wood

JOURNAL: Crystal growth & design

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
The chemical recycling of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) is very attractive as PET bottle waste provides an abundant clean material with low levels of additives. One of the most promising processes is glycolysis, which depolymerizes PET in the presence of ethylene glycol. For this process, it is necessary to think through the whole concept, from the waste material to the newly polymerized virgin polymer. Most research ends with determining the yield of bis(2-hydroxyethyl)terephthalate (BHET) after glycolysis. Some research includes antisolvent crystallization with water to separate BHET from ethylene glycol. However, the subsequent separation of water and ethylene glycol is an energy-intensive process. Therefore, this work aims to directly crystallize BHET from ethylene glycol. For this reason, the crystallization of BHET was investigated experimentally. Crystallization was simulated using gPROMS Formulated Products with the aim of estimating kinetic parameters and using these to optimize an industrial process. Kinetic parameters were determined by model validation, including primary and secondary nucleation and crystal growth. The best-fitting set of kinetic parameters was used to optimize BHET crystallization in batch and continuous modes by minimizing equipment costs. Impeller parameters were found to have a great influence on crystallization performance. Ultimately, the continuous and batch processes gave comparable results in terms of equipment cost, with the batch process giving larger crystals and higher yields but the continuous process requiring a smaller crystallizer.

TITLE: Efficient Decolorization of Recovered Bis(Hydroxyethylterephthalate) from Waste Polyester Textiles by Hydrophobic Deep Eutectic Solvents

AUTHORS: Zhanpeng Wang, Yumei Tang, Lin Zhu, Ning Liu, Gangqiang Yu, Ruinian Xu, Ning Wang, Biaohua Chen, Chengna Dai

JOURNAL: ChemSusChem

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Glycolysis is one of the most promising closed-loop recycling technologies for PET textiles; however, its efficiency is compromised by the presence of dyes, which inhibit the repolymerization of the depolymerized monomer, bis(hydroxyethylterephthalate) (BHET), into high-quality recycled PET (rPET). In this study, hydrophobic deep eutectic solvents (DES) were employed as extractants to remove colored impurities from the glycolysis solution (GS) of PET glycolysis. An optimized DES system composed of oleic acid and menthol (Men:OleA) achieved a decolorization ratio of up to 89.4 % in a simulated GS with Disperse Blue 56 doped BHET (BHET-DB56). Kinetic analysis revealed that the dye extraction by Men:OleA DES follows a pseudo-second-order kinetic model. Furthermore, DES successfully decolorized nine different colored PET textile GSs, achieving a maximum decolorization rate of 98.2 % after a secondary extraction process. Even after multiple recycling cycles, Men:OleA DES maintained consistent decolorization performance. Through characterization and quantum chemical calculations, the decolorization process was found to be driven primarily by physical interactions, specifically hydrogen bonding and van der Waals forces between dye molecules and DES. This study seeks to provide an effective method for the decolorization of BHET and proposes a strategy for the closed-loop recycling of colored PET textiles.

TITLE: Reaction rate constant: a theoretical description from local temperature

AUTHORS: Saba Valatoon, Mojtaba Alipour

JOURNAL: Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Application of various descriptors based on electron density and its associated quantities to quantify chemical reactivity within the conceptual density functional theory has recently come into spotlight. Among others and particularly relevant to our study, local temperature based on electron density as well as kinetic energy density, as a measure of the kinetic energy of an electron moving in the Kohn-Sham potential of systems, should be mentioned. In this work, we propose to use the local temperature for describing the reaction rate constant, where our main idea originates from the point that the smaller the local temperature at the reaction center, the easier the electron removal, leading to a larger rate constant. On the basis of theoretical considerations, it is proved that the rate constant variations caused by the substituent effects can well be proportional to the local temperature at the reaction center. In order to numerically validate our proposed approach, we have taken the phenol derivatives with the available experimental rate constants of theirO-methylation reaction as working models. The reason for this choice is that one of the most versatile approaches for labeling biologically active compounds with the11C nuclide for positron emission tomography (PET) is methylation by methyl iodide including11C nuclide, [11C]MeI, where methylation of phenolic oxygen with [11C]MeI is utilized to label some important tracers for PET studies. Our results unveil that the local temperature changes at the reaction center of the aforementioned reaction are reasonably correlated with the rate constant variations. Hopefully, incorporating the proposed correlations between the local temperature and the kinetics data into a computer control algorithm not only provides a simple tool for predicting the rate constant of theO-methylation reaction for other substituted phenols, but also, as a part of the chemical artificial intelligence, the optimum [11C]MeI labeling conditions for a wide variety of phenol derivatives can be controlled.

TITLE: Kinetics of Intercluster Reactions between Atomically Precise Noble Metal Clusters [Ag25(DMBT)18]- and [Au25(PET)18]- in Room Temperature Solutions

AUTHORS: Marco Neumaier, Ananya Baksi, Patrick Weis, Erik K Schneider, Papri Chakraborty, Horst Hahn, Thalappil Pradeep, Manfred M Kappes

JOURNAL: Journal of the American Chemical Society

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
The kinetics of intercluster metal atom exchange reactions between solvated [Ag25(DMBT)18]-and [Au25(PET)18]-(DMBT and PET are 2,4-dimethylbenzenethiol and 2-phenylethanethiol, respectively, both C8H10S) were probed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and computer-based modeling. Anion mass spectra and collision induced dissociation (CID) measurements show that both cluster monomers and dimers are involved in the reactions. We have modeled the corresponding kinetics assuming a reaction mechanism in which metal atom exchange occurs through transient dimers. Our kinetic model contains three types of generic reactions: dimerization of monomers, metal atom exchange in the transient dimers, and dissociation of the dimers to monomers. There are correspondingly 377 discrete species connected by in total 1302 reactions (i.e., dimerization, dissociation and atom exchange reactions) leading to the entire series of monomeric and dimeric products [AgmAu]-(m= 1-24) and [AgmAu]2-(m= 0-50), respectively. The rate constants of the corresponding reactions were fitted to the experimental data, and good agreement was obtained with exchange rate constants which scale with the probability of finding a silver or gold atom in the respective monomeric subunit of the dimer, i.e., reflecting an entropic driving force for alloying. Allowing the dimerization rate constant to scale with increasing gold composition of the respective reactants improves the agreement further. The rate constants obtained are physically plausible, thus strongly supporting dimer-mediated metal atom exchange in this intercluster reaction system.

TITLE: Non-invasive quantification of acute macrophagic lung inflammation with [11C](R)-PK11195 using a three-tissue compartment kinetic model in experimental acute respiratory distress syndrome

AUTHORS: Laurent Bitker, François Dhelft, Sophie Lancelot, Didier Le Bars, Nicolas Costes, Nazim Benzerdjeb, Maciej Orkisz, Jean-Christophe Richard

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Imaging of acute lung inflammation is pivotal to evaluate innovative ventilation strategies. We aimed to develop and validate a three-tissue compartment kinetic model (3TCM) of [11C](R)-PK11195 lung uptake in experimental acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) to help quantify macrophagic inflammation, while accounting for the impact of its non-specific and irreversible uptake in lung tissues.

Material and methods: We analyzed the data of 38 positron emission tomography (PET) studies performed in 21 swine with or without experimental ARDS, receiving general anesthesia and mechanical ventilation. Model input function was a plasma, metabolite-corrected, image-derived input function measured in the main pulmonary artery. Regional lung analysis consisted in applying both the 3TCM and the two-tissue compartment model (2TCM); in each region, the best model was selected using a selection algorithm with a goodness-of-fit criterion. Regional best model binding potentials (BPND) were compared to lung macrophage presence, semi-quantified in pathology.

Results: The 3TCM was preferred in 142 lung regions (62%, 95% confidence interval: 56 to 69%). BPNDdetermined by the 2TCM was significantly higher than the value computed with the 3TCM (overall median with interquartile range: 0.81 [0.44-1.33] vs. 0.60 [0.34-0.94], p < 0.02). Regional macrophage score was significantly associated with the best model BPND(p = 0.03). Regional BPNDwas significantly increased in the hyperinflated lung compartment, compared to the normally aerated one (median with interquartile range: 0.8 [0.6-1.7] vs. 0.6 [0.3-0.8], p = 0.03).

Conclusion: To assess the intensity and spatial distribution of acute macrophagic lung inflammation in the context of experimental ARDS with mechanical ventilation, PET quantification of [11C](R)-PK11195 lung uptake was significantly improved in most lung regions using the 3TCM. This new methodology offers the opportunity to non-invasively evaluate innovative ventilatory strategies aiming at controlling acute lung inflammation.

JOURNAL: IEEE transactions on radiation and plasma medical sciences

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Long axial field-of-view (AFOV) PET scanners allow for full-body dynamic imaging in a single bed-position at very high sensitivity. However, the benefits for kinetic parameter estimation have yet to be studied. This work uses (1) a dynamic GATE simulation of [18F]-fluorothymidine (FLT) in a modified NEMA IQ phantom and (2) a lesion embedding study of spheres in a dynamic [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) human subject imaged on the PennPET Explorer. Both studies were designed using published kinetic data of lung and liver cancers and modeled using two tissue compartments. Data were reconstructed at various emulated doses. Sphere time-activity curves (TACs) were measured on resulting dynamic images, and TACs were fit using a two-tissue-compartment model (k4≠ 0) for the FLT study and both a two-tissue-compartment model (k4= 0) and Patlak graphical analysis for the FDG study to estimate flux (Ki) and delivery (K1) parameters. Quantification of flux and K1 shows lower bias and better precision for both radiotracers on the long AFOV scanner, especially at low doses. Dynamic imaging on a long AFOV system can be achieved for a greater range of injected doses, as low as 0.5-2 mCi depending on the sphere size and flux, compared to a standard AFOV scanner, while maintaining good kinetic parameter estimation.

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear cardiology : official publication of the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Background: Oxidative stress and its interference on myocardial metabolism play a major role in Doxorubicin (DXR) cardiotoxic cascade.

Methods: Mice models of neuroblastoma (NB) were treated with 5 mg DXR/kg, either free (Free-DXR) or encapsulated in untargeted (SL[DXR]) or in NB-targeting Stealth Liposomes (pep-SL[DXR] and TP-pep-SL[DXR]). Control mice received saline. FDG-PET was performed at baseline (PET1) and 7 days after therapy (PET2). At PET2 Troponin-I and NT-proBNP were assessed. Explanted hearts underwent biochemical, histological, and immunohistochemical analyses. Finally, FDG uptake and glucose consumption were simultaneously measured in cultured H9c2 in the presence/absence of Free-DXR (1 μM).

Results: Free-DXR significantly enhanced the myocardial oxidative stress. Myocardial-SUV remained relatively stable in controls and mice treated with liposomal formulations, while it significantly increased at PET2 with respect to baseline in Free-DXR. At this timepoint, myocardial-SUV was directly correlated with both myocardial redox stress and hexose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase (H6PD) enzymatic activity, which selectively sustain cellular anti-oxidant mechanisms. Intriguingly, in vitro, Free-DXR selectively increased FDG extraction fraction without altering the corresponding value for glucose.

Conclusion: The direct correlation between cardiac FDG uptake and oxidative stress indexes supports the potential role of FDG-PET as an early biomarker of DXR oxidative damage.

AUTHORS: Benjamin Wilk, Heeseung Lim, Justin Hicks, Rebecca Sullivan, Jonathan D Thiessen, Michael Kovacs, Jane Sykes, Heather Biernaski, Stephen Duffett, Frank S Prato, Allan Skanes

JOURNAL: JACC. Clinical electrophysiology

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Background: Atrial fibrillation is associated with abnormal synchronization of left atrial electrical activity and substantially increased risk of myocardial infarction, stroke and heart failure.

Objectives: This study sought to investigate, in a canine model of atrial fibrosis, the relationship between left atrial sympathetic innervation (by11C-hydroxyephedrine positron emission tomography [PET]), extracellular volume (by magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) and endocardial voltage (by voltage mapping), measured in vivo with the extent of left atrial (LA) tissue fibrosis measured post mortem with histology.

Methods: A total of 9 adult female canines were imaged with hybrid PET/MRI. The animals were then implanted with a dual chamber pacemaker, and 1 week later, 6 animals were paced at 220 to 240 beats/min for 5 weeks, whereas the other 3 had sham surgeries. After another week, the animals were again imaged with PET/MRI and had voltage maps taken. The animals were then euthanized, hearts were excised, and the extent and location of LA fibrosis was determined using Masson's trichrome stain.

Results: End-diastolic volume and end-systolic volume increased, sympathetic innervation (measured with PET) increased in the left ventricle and LA, interstitial fibrosis increased in the LA, and extracellular volume increased in the LV. There was no significant correlation of the extent of interstitial fibrosis with bipolar voltage, MRI, or fractional uptake rate. A weak, but significant, negative correlation was found between interstitial fibrosis and unipolar voltage. Delayed enhancement failed to detect LA interstitial fibrosis.

Conclusions: Mild-to-moderate LA interstitial fibrosis may be present before affecting LA voltage maps. PET may be promising for detecting early atrial fibrillation.

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Background: Our aim was to evaluate interchangeability of different motion correction methods in the assessment of dynamic FDG-PET/CT studies in breast cancer patients as well as to assess the interrater reliability of these methods.

Methods: In our prospective study we included patients with malignant breast tumours. Dynamic PET acquisition lasted for 60 minutes after tracer (FDG) injection. Every study was assessed by the same two experienced observers. We assessed plasma activity noninvasively. In case of the primary tumour VOIs we applied two different approaches to correct motion artefacts: method I) frame-by-frame manual motion correction; method II) frame-by-frame semi-automatic software-based motion correction. FDG two-compartment kinetic modelling was applied to assess K<inf>1</inf>, k<inf>2</inf>, k<inf>3</inf> rate coefficients and to calculate K<inf>i</inf> (tracer flux constant) and MRFDG (FDG metabolic rate).

Results: Thirty-five lesions detected during 34 dynamic studies were included in this current analysis. Interrater reliability of both applied motion correction methods proved to be excellent (ICC=0.89-0.99), except K<inf>i</inf> measured by method I (ICC=0.66). Bland-Altman analysis revealed that method II resulted in significantly lower values than method I regarding k<inf>3</inf> and K<inf>i</inf> in case of both observers, and regarding MRFDG in one of the observers. In case of K<inf>1</inf> and k<inf>2</inf> the two methods were in good agreement.

Conclusions: Both applied methods proved to be reproducible and reliable, especially method II, where every measured kinetic parameter showed excellent interrater reliability. Different approaches of motion correction could have a significant effect on the results of the kinetic modelling; therefore careful selection of the most reliable method is advised.

JOURNAL: EJNMMI research

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: The conversion of synaptic glutamate to glutamine in astrocytes by glutamine synthetase (GS) is critical to maintaining healthy brain activity and may be disrupted in several brain disorders. As the GS catalysed conversion of glutamate to glutamine requires ammonia, we evaluated whether [13N]ammonia positron emission tomography (PET) could reliability quantify GS activity in humans.

Methods: In this test-retest study, eight healthy volunteers each received two dynamic [13N]ammonia PET scans on the morning and afternoon of the same day. Each [13N]ammonia scan was preceded by a [15O]water PET scan to account for effects of cerebral blood flow (CBF).

Results: Concentrations of radioactive metabolites in arterial blood were available for both sessions in five of the eight subjects. Our results demonstrated that kinetic modelling was unable to reliably distinguish estimates of the kinetic rate constant k3(related to GS activity) from K1(related to [13N]ammonia brain uptake), and indicated a non-negligible back-flux of [13N] to blood (k2). Model selection favoured a reversible one-tissue compartmental model, and [13N]ammonia K1correlated reliably (r2= 0.72-0.92) with [15O]water CBF.

Conclusion: The [13N]ammonia PET method was unable to reliably estimate GS activity in the human brain but may provide an alternative index of CBF.

JOURNAL: Frontiers in aging neuroscience

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
To study the aging human brain requires significant resources and time. Thus, mice models of aging can provide insight into changes in brain biological functions at a fraction of the time when compared to humans. This study aims to explore changes in dopamine D1and D2receptor availability and of gray matter density in striatum during aging in mice and to evaluate whether longitudinal imaging in mice may serve as a model for normal brain aging to complement cross-sectional research in humans. Mice underwent repeated structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI), and [11C]Raclopride and [11C]SCH23390 positron emission tomography (PET) was performed on a subset of aging mice. PET and sMRI data were analyzed by binding potential (BPND), voxel- and tensor-based morphometry (VBM and TBM, respectively). Longitudinal PET revealed a significant reduction in striatal BPNDfor D2receptors over time, whereas no significant change was found for D1receptors. sMRI indicated a significant increase in modulated gray matter density (mGMD) over time in striatum, with limited clusters showing decreased mGMD. Mouse [11C]Raclopride data is compatible with previous reports in human cross-sectional studies, suggesting that a natural loss of dopaminergic D2receptors in striatum can be assessed in mice, reflecting estimates from humans. No changes in D1were found, which may be attributed to altered [11C]SCH23390 kinetics in anesthetized mice, suggesting that this tracer is not yet able to replicate human findings. sMRI revealed a significant increase in mGMD. Although contrary to expectations, this increase in modulated GM density may be attributed to an age-related increase in non-neuronal cells.

ABSTRACT:
Mitochondrial complex I (MC-I) is an essential regulator of brain bioenergetics and can be quantified in the brain using PET radioligand18F-BCPP-EF. Here we evaluate the test-retest reproducibility of18F-BCPP-EF in humans, and assess the use of a non-invasive quantification method (standardised uptake value ratio - SUVR). Thirty healthy volunteers had a 90-min dynamic18F-BCPP-EF scan with arterial blood sampling, five of which received a second scan to be included in the test-retest analysis. Time-activity curves (TAC) were analysed using multilinear analysis 1 (MA1) and the two-tissue compartment model (2TC) to estimate volumes of distribution (VT). Regional SUVR-1 values were calculated from the 70 to 90-min TAC data using the centrum semiovale as a pseudo reference region, and compared to kinetic analysis-derived outcome measures. The mean absolute test-retest variability of VTranged from 12% to 18% across regions. Both DVR-1and SUVR-1 had improved test-retest variability in the range 2%-7%. SUVR-1 was highly correlated with DVR-1 (r2= 0.97,n= 30). In conclusion,18F-BCPP-EF has suitable test-retest reproducibility and can be used to quantify MC-I in clinical studies.

TITLE: Brain perfusion estimation by Tikhonov model-free deconvolution in a long axial field of view PET/CT scanner exploring five different PET tracers

AUTHORS: Henrik Bo Wiberg Larsson, Ian Law, Thomas L Andersen, Flemming L Andersen, Barbara M Fischer, Mark B Vestergaard, Tanne S W Larsson, Ulrich Lindberg

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: New total-body PET scanners with a long axial field of view (LAFOV) allow for higher temporal resolution due to higher sensitivity, which facilitates perfusion estimation by model-free deconvolution. Fundamental tracer kinetic theory predicts that perfusion can be estimated for all tracers despite their different fates given sufficiently high temporal resolution of 1 s or better, bypassing the need for compartment modelling. The aim of this study was to investigate whether brain perfusion could be estimated using model-free Tikhonov generalized deconvolution for five different PET tracers, [15O]H2O, [11C]PIB, [18F]FE-PE2I, [18F]FDG and [18F]FET. To our knowledge, this is the first example of a general model-free approach to estimate cerebral blood flow (CBF) from PET data.

Methods: Twenty-five patients underwent dynamic LAFOV PET scanning (Siemens, Quadra). PET images were reconstructed with an isotropic voxel resolution of 1.65 mm3. Time framing was 40 × 1 s during bolus passage followed by increasing framing up to 60 min. AIF was obtained from the descending aorta. Both voxel- and region-based calculations of perfusion in the thalamus were performed using the Tikhonov method. The residue impulse response function was used to estimate the extraction fraction of tracer leakage across the blood-brain barrier.

Results: CBF ranged from 37 to 69 mL blood min-1100 mL of tissue-1in the thalamus. Voxelwise calculation of CBF resulted in CBF maps in the physiologically normal range. The extraction fractions of [15O]H2O, [18F]FE-PE2I, [11C]PIB, [18F]FDG and [18F]FET in the thalamus were 0.95, 0.78, 0.62, 0.19 and 0.03, respectively.

Conclusion: The high temporal resolution and sensitivity associated with LAFOV PET scanners allow for noninvasive perfusion estimation of multiple tracers. The method provides an estimation of the residue impulse response function, from which the fate of the tracer can be studied, including the extraction fraction, influx constant, volume of distribution and transit time distribution, providing detailed physiological insight into normal and pathologic tissue.

TITLE: Estimation of renal perfusion based on measurement of rubidium-82 clearance by PET/CT scanning in healthy subjects

AUTHORS: Stine Sundgaard Langaa, Thomas Guldager Lauridsen, Frank Holden Mose, Claire Anne Fynbo, Jørn Theil, Jesper Nørgaard Bech

JOURNAL: EJNMMI physics

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Background: Changes in renal blood flow (RBF) may play a pathophysiological role in hypertension and kidney disease. However, RBF determination in humans has proven difficult. We aimed to confirm the feasibility of RBF estimation based on positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) and rubidium-82 (82Rb) using the abdominal aorta as input function in a 1-tissue compartment model.

Methods: Eighteen healthy subjects underwent two dynamic82Rb PET/CT scans in two different fields of view (FOV). FOV-A included the left ventricular blood pool (LVBP), the abdominal aorta (AA) and the majority of the kidneys. FOV-B included AA and the kidneys in their entirety. In FOV-A, an input function was derived from LVBP and from AA, in FOV-B from AA. One-tissue compartmental modelling was performed using tissue time activity curves generated from volumes of interest (VOI) contouring the kidneys, where the renal clearance of82Rb is represented by the K1kinetic parameter. Total clearance for both kidneys was calculated by multiplying the K1values with the volume of VOIs used for analysis. Intra-assay coefficients of variation and inter-observer variation were calculated.

Results: For both kidneys, K1values derived from AA did not differ significantly from values obtained from LVBP, neither were significant differences seen between AA in FOV-A and AA in FOV-B, nor between the right and left kidneys. For both kidneys, the intra-assay coefficients of variation were low (~ 5%) for both input functions. The measured K1of 2.80 ml/min/cm3translates to a total clearance for both kidneys of 766 ml/min/1.73 m2.

Conclusion: Measurement of renal perfusion based on PET/CT and82Rb using AA as input function in a 1-tissue compartment model is feasible in a single FOV. Based on previous studies showing82Rb to be primarily present in plasma, the measured K1clearance values are most likely representative of effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) rather than estimated RBF values, but as the accurate calculation of total clearance/flow is very much dependent on the analysed volume, a standardised definition for the employed renal volumes is needed to allow for proper comparison with standard ERPF and RBF reference methods.

TITLE: Dynamic onset response of the internal carotid artery to hypercapnia is blunted in children compared with adults

AUTHORS: Christine M Tallon, Jack S Talbot, Kurt J Smith, Nia Lewis, Daniela Nowak-Flück, Mike Stembridge, Philip Ainslie, Ali M McManus

JOURNAL: Physiological reports

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Intracranial blood velocity reactivity to a steady-state hypercapnic stimulus has been shown to be similar in children and adults, but the onset response to hypercapnia is slower in the child. Given the vasodilatory effect of hypercapnia on the cerebrovasculature, assessment of vessel diameter, and blood flow are vital to fully elucidate whether the temporal hypercapnic response differs in children versus adults. Assessment of internal carotid artery (ICA) vessel diameter (ICAd), blood velocity (ICAv), volumetric blood flow (QICA), and shear rate (ICASR) in response to a 4 min hypercapnic challenge was completed in children (n = 14, 8 girls; 9.8 ± 0.7 years) and adults (n = 17, 7 females; 24.7 ± 1.8 years). The dynamic onset responses of partial pressure of end-tidal CO2(PETCO2), QICA, ICAv, and ICASRto hypercapnia were modeled, and mean response time (MRT) was computed. Following 4 min of hypercapnia, ICA reactivity and ICAd were comparable between the groups. Despite a similar MRT in PETCO2in children and adults, children had slower QICA(children 108 ± 60 s vs. adults 66 ± 37 s; p = 0.023), ICAv (children 120 ± 52 s vs. adults 52 ± 31 s; p = 0.001), and ICASR(children 90 ± 27 s vs. adults 47 ± 36 s; p = 0.001) MRTs compared with adults. This is the first study to show slower hypercapnic hyperemic kinetic responses of the ICA in children. The mechanisms determining these differences and the need to consider the duration of hypercapnic exposure when assessing CVR in children should be considered in future studies.

TITLE: High-resolution radioluminescence microscopy of FDG uptake in an engineered 3D tumor-stoma model

AUTHORS: Syamantak Khan, Sungwoo Kim, Yunzhi Peter Yang, Guillem Pratx

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: The increased glucose metabolism of cancer cells is the basis for18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET). However, due to its coarse image resolution, PET is unable to resolve the metabolic role of cancer-associated stroma, which often influences the metabolic reprogramming of a tumor. This study investigates the use of radioluminescence microscopy for imaging FDG uptake in engineered 3D tumor models with high resolution.

Method: Multicellular tumor spheroids (A549 lung adenocarcinoma) were co-cultured with GFP-expressing human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) within an artificial extracellular matrix to mimic a tumor and its surrounding stroma. The tumor model was constructed as a 200-μm-thin 3D layer over a transparent CdWO4scintillator plate to allow high-resolution imaging of the cultured cells. After incubation with FDG, the radioluminescence signal was collected by a highly sensitive widefield microscope. Fluorescence microscopy was performed using the same instrument to localize endothelial and tumor cells.

Results: Simultaneous and co-localized brightfield, fluorescence, and radioluminescence imaging provided high-resolution information on the distribution of FDG in the engineered tissue. The microvascular stromal compartment as a whole took up a large fraction of the FDG, comparable to the uptake of the tumor spheroids. In vitro gamma counting confirmed that A549 and HUVEC cells were both highly glycolytic with rapid FDG uptake kinetics. Despite the relative thickness of the tissue constructs, an average spatial resolution of 64 ± 4 μm was achieved for imaging FDG.

Conclusion: Our study demonstrates the feasibility of imaging the distribution of FDG uptake in engineered in vitro tumor models. With its high spatial resolution, the method can separately resolve tumor and stromal components. The approach could be extended to more advanced engineered cancer models but also to surgical tissue slices and tumor biopsies.

TITLE: Characterization and Validation of Radiotracer Kinetics Using the Langendorff Isolated Perfused Heart

AUTHORS: Friedrich Baark, Edward C T Waters, Thomas R Eykyn, Richard Southworth

JOURNAL: Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
The Langendorff isolated perfused heart is a physiologically relevant and controllable ex vivo model well suited to characterizing and validating novel radiotracers for a wide range of molecular imaging applications. It allows the monitoring of first pass tracer uptake kinetics either as a bolus injection or as a continuous infusion in beating myocardial tissue with a high degree of experimental control in terms of cardiac workload, perfusion, energy substrate delivery and composition, and drug co-administration. The radiotracer pharmacokinetic data that it provides is not contaminated by confounding factors such as off-target tracer metabolism, and as a non-imaging technique, time activity curves can be acquired with very high temporal resolution. In this chapter, we describe the basic principles and practice for setting up and using Langendorff isolated perfused hearts for the assessment of novel radiotracers and outline their potential for modeling pathophysiological conditions relevant to cardiovascular disease.

TITLE: Adsorption properties and influencing factors of Cu(II) on polystyrene and polyethylene terephthalate microplastics in seawater

AUTHORS: Xingxing Wang, Ruixin Zhang, Zhaoying Li, Bo Yan

JOURNAL: The Science of the total environment

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
As an emerging contamination in the ocean, microplastics can act as effective vectors of pollutants, the ecological risks caused by the combined pollution of microplastics and other pollutants have attracted growing attention. In this work, Copper (Cu(II)) was chosen as the classic pollutant, polystyrene (PS) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) pellets were used as the typical marine microplastics, the adsorption performance of Cu(II) on PS and PET beads was investigated by adsorption kinetics and isotherm experiments, and other influencing conditions, such as pH, salinity, coexisting heavy metals ions and aging treatment, were evaluated. The results indicated that the adsorption behavior of Cu(II) on PS and PET was spontaneous and endothermic in the simulated seawater environment, and the batch experimental data can be effectively described by pseudo-second-order model and Freundlich isothermal model. Besides, the adsorption capacity of microplastics for Cu(II) was the best at pH 7, the change of salinity had no obvious effect on the adsorption in the natural marine environment. Moreover, co-existence of lead (Pb(II)) exhibited evident impacts on Cu(II) sorption onto PS and PET, which confirmed the adsorption competition effect between them. Additionally, high temperature aging treatment of microplastics in different environments for different duration time could obviously affect the properties of microplastics. It was found that the microplastics after being exposed to high temperature environment in the air for 168 h showed relatively stronger adsorption amount for Cu(II). In summary, these findings suggested that electrostatic interaction and distributed diffusion mechanisms may be the main mechanisms of adsorption, while no new functional groups were generated after the adsorption, indicating that physisorption may dominate the adsorption performance of PS and PET pellets for Cu(II). This study provides supplementary insights into the role of microplastics as carriers of heavy metals in the marine environment.

TITLE: Advancing Estimation of Hepatobiliary Clearances in Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic Models of Rosuvastatin Using Human Hepatic Concentrations

AUTHORS: Li Wang, Zhiyao Zhu, Doanh Tran, Shirley K Seo, Xiaolei Pan

JOURNAL: Pharmaceutical research

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: To estimate hepatobiliary clearances of rosuvastatin via simultaneously fitting to reported human positron emission tomography (PET) data in the liver and gallbladder.

Methods: A hepatobiliary model incorporating five intrinsic hepatobiliary clearances (active uptake clearance at the sinusoidal membrane, efflux clearance by passive diffusion through the sinusoidal membrane, influx clearance by passive diffusion through sinusoidal membrane, clearance of biliary excretion at the canalicular membrane, and intercompartment clearance from the intrahepatic bile duct to the gallbladder) and three compartments (liver, intrahepatic bile duct, and gallbladder) was developed to simultaneously fit rosuvastatin liver and gallbladder data from a representative subject reported by Billington et al. (1). Two liver blood supply input functions, arterial input function and dual input function (using peripheral venous as an alternative to portal vein), were assessed. Additionally, the predictive performance between the established model and four reported models trained with only systemic exposure data, was evaluated by comparing simulated liver and gallbladder profiles with observations.

Results: The established hepatobiliary model well captured the kinetic profiles of rosuvastatin in the liver and gallbladder during the PET scans. Application of dual input function led to a marked underestimation of liver concentrations at the initial stage after i.v. dosing which cannot be offset by altering model parameter values. The simulated hepatobiliary profiles from three of the reported models demonstrated substantial deviation from the observed data.

Conclusions: The present study highlights the necessity of using hepatobiliary data to verify and improve the predictive performance of hepatic disposition of rosuvastatin.

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Kinetic modeling of positron emission tomography (PET) data can assess index rate of uptake, metabolism and predict disease progression more accurately than conventional static PET. However, it requires knowledge of the time-course of the arterial blood radioactivity concentration, called the arterial input function (AIF). The gold standard to acquire the AIF is by invasive means. The purpose of this study was to validate a previously developed dual readout scintillating fiber-based non-invasive positron detector, hereinafter called non-invasive detector (NID), developed to determine the AIF for dynamic PET measured from the human radial artery. The NID consisted of a 3 m long plastic scintillating fiber with each end coupled to a 5 m long transmission fiber followed by a silicon photomultiplier. The scintillating fiber was enclosed inside the grooves of a plastic cylindrical shell. Two sets of experiments were performed to test the NID against a previously validated microfluidic positron detector. A closed-loop microfluidic system combined with a wrist phantom was used. During the first experiment, the three PET radioisotopes18F,11C and68Ga were tested. After optimizing the detector, a second series of tests were performed using only18F and11C. The maximum pulse amplitude to electronic noise ratio was 52 obtained with11C. Linear regressions showed a linear relation between the two detectors. These preliminary results show that the NID can accurately detect positrons from a patient's wrist and has the potential to non-invasively measure the AIF during a dynamic PET scan. The accuracy of these measurements needs to be determined.

JOURNAL: Frontiers in neurology

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Small vessel disease (SVD) is associated with cognitive impairment in older age and be implicated in vascular dementia. Post-mortem studies show proliferation of activated microglia in the affected white matter. However, the role of inflammation in SVD pathogenesis is incompletely understood and better biomarkers are needed. We hypothesized that expression of the 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO), a marker of microglial activation, would be higher in SVD. Positron emission tomography (PET) was performed with the second-generation TSPO ligand [11C]PBR28 in 11 participants with SVD. TSPO binding was evaluated by a two-tissue compartment model, with and without a vascular binding component, in white matter hyperintensities (WMH) and normal-appearing white matter (NAWM). In post-mortem tissue, in a separate cohort of individuals with SVD, immunohistochemistry was performed for TSPO and a pan-microglial marker Iba1. Kinetic modeling showed reduced tracer volume and blood volume fraction in WMH compared with NAWM, but a significant increase in vascular binding. Vascular [11C]PBR28 binding was also increased compared with normal-appearing white matter of healthy participants free of SVD. Immunohistochemistry showed a diffuse increase in microglial staining (with Iba1) in sampled tissue in SVD compared with control samples, but with only a subset of microglia staining positively for TSPO. Intense TSPO staining was observed in the vicinity of damaged small blood vessels, which included perivascular macrophages. The results suggest an altered phenotype of activated microglia, with reduced TSPO expression, in the areas of greatest white matter ischemia in SVD, with implications for the interpretation of TSPO PET studies in older individuals or those with vascular risk factors.

ABSTRACT:
The quantitative relationship between the disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the recruitment of glial cells was explored in a mouse model of endotoxemia. [18F]2-Fluoro-2-deoxy-sorbitol ([18F]FDS) PET imaging was used as a paracellular marker for quantitative monitoring of BBB permeability after i.v injection of increasing doses of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or vehicle (saline, n = 5). The brain distribution of [18F]FDS (VT, mL.cm-3) was estimated using kinetic modeling. LPS dose-dependently increased the brainVTof [18F]FDS after injection of LPS 4 mg/kg (5.2 ± 2.4-fold, n = 4, p < 0.01) or 5 mg/kg (9.0 ± 9.1-fold, n = 4, p < 0.01) but not 3 mg/kg (p > 0.05, n = 7). In 12 individuals belonging to the different groups, changes in BBB permeability were compared with expression of markers of astrocyte (GFAP) and microglial cell (CD11b) usingex vivoimmunohistochemistry. Increased expression of CD11b and GFAP expression was observed in mice injected with 3 mg/kg of LPS, which did not increase with higher LPS doses. Quantitative [18F]FDS PET imaging can capture different levels of BBB permeability in vivo. A biphasic effect was observed with the lowest dose of LPS that triggered neuroinflammation without disruptive changes in BBB permeability, and higher LPS doses that increased BBB permeability without additional recruitment of glial cells.

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
P-Glycoprotein (P-gp) is an efflux pump located at the blood-brain barrier (BBB) that contributes to the protection of the central nervous system by transporting neurotoxic compounds out of the brain. A decline in P-gp function has been related to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. P-gp inducers can increase the P-gp function and are considered as potential candidates for the treatment of such disorders. The P-gp inducer MC111 increased P-gp expression and function in SW480 human colon adenocarcinoma and colo-320 cells, respectively. Our study aims to evaluate the P-gp inducing effect of MC111 in the whole brainin vivo, using the P-gp tracer [18F]MC225 and positron emission tomography (PET). Eighteen Wistar rats were treated with either vehicle solution, 4.5 mg/kg of MC111 (low-dose group), or 6 mg/kg of MC111 (high-dose group). Animals underwent a 60 min dynamic PET scan with arterial-blood sampling, 24 h after treatment with the inducer. Data were analyzed using the 1-tissue-compartment model and metabolite-corrected plasma as the input function. Model parameters such as the influx constant (K1) and volume of distribution (VT) were calculated, which reflect thein vivoP-gp function. P-gp and pregnane xenobiotic receptor (PXR) expression levels of the whole brain were assessed using western blot. The administration of MC111 decreasedK1andVTof [18F]MC225 in the whole brain and all of the selected brain regions. In the high-dose group, whole-brainK1was decreased by 34% (K1-high-dose = 0.20 ± 0.02 vsK1-control = 0.30 ± 0.02;p< 0.001) and in the low-dose group by 7% (K1-low-dose = 0.28 ± 0.02 vsK1-control = 0.30 ± 0.02;p= 0.42) compared to controls. Whole-brainVTwas decreased by 25% in the high-dose group (VT-high-dose = 5.92 ± 0.41 vsVT-control = 7.82 ± 0.38;p< 0.001) and by 6% in the low-dose group (VT-low-dose = 7.35 ± 0.38 vsVT-control = 7.82 ± 0.37;p= 0.38) compared to controls.k2values did not vary after treatment. The treatment did not affect the metabolism of [18F]MC225. Western blot studies using the whole-brain tissue did not detect changes in the P-gp expression, however, preliminary results using isolated brain capillaries found an increasing trend up to 37% in treated rats. The decrease inK1andVTvalues after treatment with the inducer indicates an increase in the P-gp functionality at the BBB of treated rats. Moreover, preliminary results using brain endothelial cells also sustained the increase in the P-gp expression. In conclusion, the results verify that MC111 induces P-gp expression and function at the BBB in rats. An increasing trend regarding the P-gp expression levels is found using western blot and an increased P-gp function is confirmed with [18F]MC225 and PET.

TITLE: Combined experimental and molecular dynamics removal processes of contaminant phenol from simulated wastewater by polyethylene terephthalate microplastics

AUTHORS: Christian Ebere Enyoh, Qingyue Wang

JOURNAL: Environmental technology

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Microplastics (MPs) and phenolics are pollutants found ubiquitously in freshwater systems. MPs oftentimes serve as a vector for pollutants across ecosystems and are now being explored as alternative adsorbents for pollutant removal. This strategy would reflect the 'reuse' of an existing waste stream into a potentially useful product while at the same time helping to minimize plastic waste in the marine environment. In this study, the adsorption of phenol onto pristine (Pr-PET), modified (Mod-PET), and aged (Ag-PET) Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) microplastics was examined experimentally and theoretically. Kinetics, isotherms, and thermodynamics models were used to investigate the adsorption process while Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were employed to investigate molecular level alterations. The result showed that the Ag-PET MPs had the best removal efficiency due larger surface area and the adsorption occurred in a pseudo-second-order manner, showing that the rate of phenol adsorption is directly proportional to the number of surface-active sites on the surface of PET MPs while the intraparticle diffusion defined rate-limiting step. However, the maximum monolayer adsorption capacity followed Mod-PET (38.02 mg/g) > Ag-PET (8.08 mg/g) > Pr-PET (6.84 mg/g). The adsorption process proceeded spontaneously and thermodynamically favourable. GCMC-MD simulations revealed that PET MPs are capable of successfully adsorbing the phenol molecule through Van der Waals and electrostatic interactions and can be adopted as novel adsorbents for phenol removal in aqueous solutions.

TITLE: Integrative models for environmental forecasting of phthalate migration from microplastics in aquaculture environments

AUTHORS: Shan Zhong, Ruiyue Li, Yaowen Tian, Zengxian Wei, Lishan Zhang, Yan Chen, Ruyue Zhou, Qian Zhang, Xuan Ru

JOURNAL: Journal of hazardous materials

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
The pervasive utilization of plastic tools in aquaculture introduces significant volumes of microplastic fibers, presenting a consequential risk through the leaching of additives such as phthalates. This study scrutinizes the leaching dynamics of six prevalent phthalate esters (PAEs) from thirteen plastic aquaculture tools comprising polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polypropylene (PP), and polyethylene (PE), with ΣPAEs ranging from 0.24 to 4.26 mg g-1. Di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) and dibutyl phthalate (DBP) emerged as predominant, marking significant environmental concern. Over a 30-day period, leaching quantities of Σ6PAEs from PET, PP, and PE fibers reached 36.65 μg g-1, 21.87 μg g-1and 19.11 μg g-1, respectively, influenced by factors such as time, temperature, turbulence, and salinity. Notably, turbulence exerted the most pronounced effect, followed by temperature, with negligible influence from salinity. The kinetic models aligning with interface diffusion control was developed, predicting PAEs' leaching behavior with activation energies (Ea) indicative of the process's thermodynamic nature. The application of this model to real-world aquaculture waters forecasted significant risks, corroborating with empirical data and underscoring the pressing need for regulatory and mitigation strategies against PAEs contamination from aquaculture practices.

TITLE: Impact of Mechanical Ventilation and Anesthesia on PET Tracer Kinetics for Combined PET/fMRI Studies in Rats

AUTHORS: Yan Ma, Laura Kuebler, Sabrina Haas, Andreas Maurer, Kristina Herfert

JOURNAL: Molecular imaging and biology

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Positron Emission Tomography (PET), a crucial tool in molecular brain imaging, has evolved into a hybrid system through integration with functional MRI (fMRI). This advancement facilitates the simultaneous recording of molecular and functional data in animal models, offering insights into neuroreceptor and neurotransmitter dynamics and their effects on brain function. While mechanical ventilation is often used in small animal fMRI to stabilize physiological blood gas levels, its effects on PET tracer kinetics remain underexplored.

Procedures: This study examines the kinetics of [11C]raclopride, a dopamine-sensitive PET tracer targeting D2/D3 receptors, under various respiratory conditions and anesthesia protocols frequently used in small animal fMRI and PET.

Results: Results indicate significant variations in tracer kinetics: increased peak levels, a shorter time to peak, and a faster tracer equilibrium in standard uptake value ratio were observed in spontaneously breathing animals versus those under mechanical ventilation. The anesthesia type also strongly influenced the tracer kinetics: α-chloralose anesthesia reduced brain uptake, whereas isoflurane led to a more rapid equilibrium.

Conclusions: These findings underscore the profound impact of mechanical ventilation and anesthesia selection on PET tracer kinetics in hybrid PET/fMRI studies. The study highlights that those protocols established for fMRI are not directly transferable to PET imaging in small animals, emphasizing the necessity for a careful investigation of the influence of anesthesia and ventilation techniques on tracer kinetics.

AUTHORS: Marloes J M Peters, Roel Wierts, Elisabeth M C Jutten, Wouter A M Broos, Mariel P Ter Laak, Paul C Willems

JOURNAL: Journal of orthopaedic surgery and research

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Posterior Lumbar Interbody Fusion (PLIF) is a surgical procedure in which stabilization of spinal segments is achieved by inserting interbody cages filled with bone graft. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is an imaging modality to assess physiological processes at cellular level, well before manifestation of morphological changes on computed tomography (CT). The goal was to determine whether18F-fluoride PET/CT findings six weeks after PLIF, can predict bony fusion one year postoperatively on CT.

Materials and methods: 20 consecutive PLIF patients (21 levels) were prospectively included. Based on diagnostic CT one year postoperatively, operated segments were classified as pseudarthrotic or fused.18F-fluoride PET/CT scanning was performed at six weeks and one year, yielding parameters related to overall bone metabolism, bone blood flow and bone mineral incorporation. Differences in PET parameters between groups and follow-up moments were assessed. The area under the curve from the receiver operating characteristic was calculated for each PET parameter as a measure of diagnostic accuracy.

Results: 11 segments were classified as pseudarthrotic and 10 as fused. Pseudarthrotic segments showed lower intervertebral overall bone metabolism values compared to fused segments at six weeks. Pseudarthrotic segments showed lower intervertebral bone blood flow at six weeks and lower intervertebral bone mineral incorporation at one year compared to fused segments. Overall bone metabolism of the operated intervertebral disc space at six weeks had the highest diagnostic accuracy for predicting the fusion status at one year.

Conclusions: 18F-fluoride PET/CT six weeks after PLIF provides prognostic information on bony fusion at one year.

AUTHORS: Zi-Chun Wang, Chen-Qiang Qin, Xia Zhang, Qian Wang, Ruo-Xuan Li, Di-Feng Ren

JOURNAL: Food chemistry

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Multilayer bottles consisting of chitosan (CS), microcrystalline cellulose (MCC), whey protein isolate (WPI), and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) were tested as novel materials for packaging and extending shelf life of rosebud beverages. We studied the storage stability at 4 °C, 25 °C, 37 °C, and 55 °C by assessing the physical and biochemical parameters. The results show that multilayer PET bottles had better barrier performance and improved soluble solids content, pH, polyphenol content, color indices, and browning degree in rosebud beverages over the control at all studied temperatures. A shelf life model was established based on the Arrhenius equation, and the number of days when polyphenol contents dropped to <50% of the initial content was defined as the shelf life. Our results highlight the reliability of the prediction model, and we conclude that packaging rosebud beverages in multilayer PET bottles significantly extends the product shelf life, and this benefit was further extended at low temperatures.

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Background: PET imaging of activated microglia has improved our understanding of the pathology behind disability progression in MS, and pro-inflammatory microglia at 'smoldering' lesion rims have been implicated as drivers of disability progression. The P2X7R is upregulated in the cellular membranes of activated microglia. A single-tissue dual-input model was applied to quantify P2X7R binding in the normal appearing white matter, perilesional areas and thalamus among progressive MS patients, healthy controls and newly diagnosed relapsing MS patients.

Results: Overall, tracer uptake in the MS brain was not significantly higher compared to HCs. In the 3 mm perilesional rim of all T1 lesions, tracer binding was higher among relapsing patients compared to progressive patients. Tracer binding was higher in males compared to females. Disease duration correlated with tracer binding in the normal appearing white matter. Age correlated negatively with tracer binding in the perilesional rims.

Conclusions: Even as binding estimates obtained with the dual-input model were consistent with the expected distribution of P2X7Rs in the MS brain, the small free fraction of the parent tracer may limit its accuracy and applicability, and binding estimates between subjects were highly variable. Conclusive evidence for the applicability of [11C]SMW139 to detect MS-related diffuse smoldering inflammation was not obtained.

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: [11C]CHDI-00485180-R ([11C]CHDI-180R) is a novel PET radioligand developed to image aggregated mutant huntingtin (mHTT). Data from mouse models of Huntington's disease (HD) and biodistribution studies in healthy volunteers suggested that [11C]CHDI-180R is a promising candidate for in vivo determination of cerebral aggregated mHTT levels using PET. In the iMagemHTT study reported here, we investigated [11C]CHDI-180R kinetic properties and suitability to quantify aggregated mHTT in brains of people with HD (pwHD).

Methods: A total of 12 pwHD (53.7 ± 6.9y, 5 M/ 7 F, Shoulson-Fahn stage 2) and 12 healthy controls (HC; six young [26.8 ± 3.2y], 2 M/ 4 F; six age-matched [53.7 ± 6.1y],2 M/ 4 F) were included. We conducted dynamic 90 min [11C]CHDI-180R PET imaging with arterial sampling and radiometabolite quantification, and delineated volumes of interest (VOIs) using individual 3D T1-MRI. We calculated total distribution volumes (VT) using 2-compartment modelling (2TCM) as well as Logan graphical analysis and determined distribution volume ratios relative to cerebellum (DVRCBL). We applied partial volume correction, and assessed test-retest variability in pwHD.

Results: VTshowed considerable intersubject variability among HC (VT(cortex)= 0.68 ± 0.22) and pwHD (VT(cortex)= 0.75 ± 0.26), without any regional significant differences between the groups. VTtest-retest variability was high if test and retest scans were performed on the same day, but low (< 10%) if performed one week apart. DVRCBLshowed significantly higher [11C]CHDI-180R relative binding in frontal, temporal, parietal, occipital and composite cortex VOIs (average increase 19.5 ± 6.1%) in pwHD than age-matched HC.

Conclusion: [11C]CHDI-180R VTshowed high intersubject variability and relatively low signal-to-background ratio. However, significant differences were found between pwHD and HC using cerebellum as pseudo-reference region.

TITLE: [18F]F-FAPI-42 PET dynamic imaging characteristics and multiparametric quantification of lung cancer: an exploratory study using uEXPLORER PET/CT

AUTHORS: Lijuan Wang, Xingzhu Pan, Shimin Ye, Yanchao Huang, Meng Wang, Li Chen, Kemin Zhou, Yanjiang Han, Hubing Wu

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: To explore the dynamic and parametric characteristics of [18F]F-FAPI-42 PET/CT in lung cancers.

Methods: Nineteen participants with newly diagnosed lung cancer underwent 60-min dynamic [18F]F-FAPI-42 PET/CT. Time-activity curves (TAC) were generated for tumors and normal organs, with kinetic parameters (K1, K2, K3, K4, Ki) calculated. A new parameter, the K ratio (K1+ K3)/(K2+ K4), was introduced to measure net uptake efficiency.

Results: In primary tumor (PT), [18F]F-FAPI-42 uptake showed a gradual increase followed by a plateau, contrasting with organs like the thyroid and pancreas, which showed rapid uptake and continuous washout. Compared to non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), small cell lung cancer (SCLC) lesions reached the plateau earlier (11 min vs. 14 min) but had a lower uptake. During the plateau phase, [18F]F-FAPI-42 demonstrated slight washout in SCLC, whereas its uptake increased slightly in NSCLC. Lymph node and distant metastases exhibited similar TAC profiles to primary tumors. Kinetic modeling revealed that an irreversible two-compartment model (irre-2TCM) best represented the pharmacokinetics of [18F]F-FAPI-42 in lung cancer, whereas re-2TCM was better suited for the pancreas and thyroid. Lower K1, K2, K3and K4were observed in PT compared to those in the pancreas and thyroid (P < 0.05), however, the K ratio in PT was found to be 2-3 times higher. SCLC had lower Kiand SUVmean than NSCLC (P < 0.05). Kinetic parameter differences were also observed between PT and metastatic lesions. Larger metastatic lymph nodes exhibited higher K1, Ki, and K ratio than smaller ones.

Conclusion: Lung cancers exhibit distinct [18F]F-FAPI-42 dynamic and kinetic characteristics compared to the thyroid gland and pancreas. Differences were also observed between SCLC and NSCLC, primary and metastatic lesions, as well as larger versus smaller lesions. These findings provide valuable insights into the in vivo pharmacokinetics of [18F]F-FAPI-42, potentially improving the diagnosis of lung cancer.

TITLE: Validation of image-derived input function using a long axial field of view PET/CT scanner for two different tracers

ABSTRACT:
Background: Accurate image-derived input function (IDIF) from highly sensitive large axial field of view (LAFOV) PET/CT scanners could avoid the need of invasive blood sampling for kinetic modelling. The aim is to validate the use of IDIF for two kinds of tracers, 3 different IDIF locations and 9 different reconstruction settings.

Methods: Eight [18F]FDG and 10 [18F]DPA-714 scans were acquired respectively during 70 and 60 min on the Vision Quadra PET/CT system. PET images were reconstructed using various reconstruction settings. IDIFs were taken from ascending aorta (AA), descending aorta (DA), and left ventricular cavity (LV). The calibration factor (CF) extracted from the comparison between the IDIFs and the manual blood samples as reference was used for IDIFs accuracy and precision assessment. To illustrate the effect of various calibrated-IDIFs on Patlak linearization for [18F]FDG and Logan linearization for [18F]DPA-714, the same target time-activity curves were applied for each calibrated-IDIF.

Results: For [18F]FDG, the accuracy and precision of the IDIFs were high (mean CF ≥ 0.82, SD ≤ 0.06). Compared to the striatum influx (Ki) extracted using calibrated AA IDIF with the updated European Association of Nuclear Medicine Research Ltd. standard reconstruction (EARL2), Kimean differences were < 2% using the other calibrated IDIFs. For [18F]DPA714, high accuracy of the IDIFs was observed (mean CF ≥ 0.86) except using absolute scatter correction, DA and LV (respectively mean CF = 0.68, 0.47 and 0.44). However, the precision of the AA IDIFs was low (SD ≥ 0.10). Compared to the distribution volume (VT) in a frontal region obtained using calibrated continuous arterial sampler input function as reference, VTmean differences were small using calibrated AA IDIFs (for example VTmean difference = -5.3% using EARL2), but higher using calibrated DA and LV IDIFs (respectively + 12.5% and + 19.1%).

Conclusions: For [18F]FDG, IDIF do not need calibration against manual blood samples. For [18F]DPA-714, AA IDIF can replace continuous arterial sampling for simplified kinetic quantification but only with calibration against arterial blood samples. The accuracy and precision of IDIF from LAFOV PET/CT system depend on tracer, reconstruction settings and IDIF VOI locations, warranting careful optimization.

TITLE: Sorption of thiamin (vitamin B1) onto micro(nano)plastics: pH dependence and sorption models

AUTHORS: Mehmet Kilincer, Hasan Saygin, Mustafa Ozyurek, Asli Baysal

JOURNAL: Journal of environmental science and health. Part A, Toxic/hazardous substances & environmental engineering

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
As the carrier of various inorganics and organics from various media, micro(nano)plastics have an impact on the environment and human health. Recently, many studies have examined the sorption of various organics including antibiotics. However, while vitamins have critical roles in the environment and microsystems from humans to plant life, the sorption of vitamins onto micro(nano)plastics are still uninvestigated. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the sorption of vitamin B1 onto various micro(nano)plastics from food packages under different pHs using batch technique; sorption kinetics and isotherms models were investigated as well. The results indicated that higher capacities were obtained between 360 min to 1440 min in polypropylene and polyethylene micro(nano)plastics, and similar kinetic behaviors observed in different pHs. However, the sorption responses (sorption capacity, equilibrium time) of polyethylene terephthalate and polystyrene were varied. The sorption kinetics between vitamin B1 and micro(nano)plastics showed that the pseudo-first-order model was better to fit for polyethylene terephthalate and polystyrene compared to the pseudo-second-order kinetics, however it was changed for polypropylene and polyethylene. Moreover, the obtained results suggest a complex nature of vitamin B1 sorption, including both chemical and physical sorption occur under various pHs and polymer types.

TITLE: Levetiracetam modulates brain metabolic networks and transcriptomic signatures in the 5XFAD mouse model of Alzheimer's disease

AUTHORS: Charles P Burton, Evgeny J Chumin, Alyssa Y Collins, Scott A Persohn, Kristen D Onos, Ravi S Pandey, Sara K Quinney, Paul R Territo

JOURNAL: Frontiers in neuroscience

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Introduction: Subcritical epileptiform activity is associated with impaired cognitive function and is commonly seen in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The anti-convulsant, levetiracetam (LEV), is currently being evaluated in clinical trials for its ability to reduce epileptiform activity and improve cognitive function in AD. The purpose of the current study was to apply pharmacokinetics (PK), network analysis of medical imaging, gene transcriptomics, and PK/PD modeling to a cohort of amyloidogenic mice to establish how LEV restores or drives alterations in the brain networks of mice in a dose-dependent basis using the rigorous preclinical pipeline of the MODEL-AD Preclinical Testing Core.

Methods: Chronic LEV was administered to 5XFAD mice of both sexes for 3 months based on allometrically scaled clinical dose levels from PK models. Data collection and analysis consisted of a multi-modal approach utilizing18F-FDG PET/MRI imaging and analysis, transcriptomic analyses, and PK/PD modeling.

Results: Pharmacokinetics of LEV showed a sex and dose dependence in Cmax, CL/F, and AUC0-∞, with simulations used to estimate dose regimens. Chronic dosing at 10, 30, and 56 mg/kg, showed18F-FDG specific regional differences in brain uptake, and in whole brain covariance measures such as clustering coefficient, degree, network density, and connection strength (i.e., positive and negative). In addition, transcriptomic analysis via nanoString showed dose-dependent changes in gene expression in pathways consistent18F-FDG uptake and network changes, and PK/PD modeling showed a concentration dependence for key genes, but not for network covariance modeling.

Discussion: This study represents the first report detailing the relationships of metabolic covariance and transcriptomic network changes resulting from LEV administration in 5XFAD mice. Overall, our results highlight non-linear kinetics based on dose and sex, where gene expression analysis demonstrated LEV dose- and concentration-dependent changes, along with cerebral metabolism, and/or cerebral homeostatic mechanisms relevant to human AD, which aligned closely with network covariance analysis of18F-FDG images. Collectively, this study show cases the value of a multimodal connectomic, transcriptomic, and pharmacokinetic approach to further investigate dose dependent relationships in preclinical studies, with translational value toward informing clinical study design.

ABSTRACT:
Reprogramming of energy metabolism in the development of prostate cancer can be exploited for a better diagnosis and treatment of the disease. The goal of this study was to determine whether differences in glucose and pyruvate metabolism of human prostate cancer cells with dissimilar aggressivenesses can be detected using hyperpolarized [1-13C]pyruvate MRS and [18F]FDG-PET imaging, and to evaluate whether these measures correlate. For this purpose, we compared murine xenografts of human prostate cancer LNCaP cells with those of more aggressive PC3 cells. [1-13C]pyruvate was hyperpolarized by dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization (dDNP) and [1-13C]pyruvate to lactate conversion was followed by13C MRS. Subsequently [18F]FDG uptake was investigated by static and dynamic PET measurements. Standard uptake values (SUVs) for [18F]FDG were significantly higher for xenografts of PC3 compared with those of LNCaP. However, we did not observe a difference in the average apparent rate constant kplof13C label exchange from pyruvate to lactate between the tumor variants. A significant negative correlation was found between SUVs from [18F]FDG PET measurements and kplvalues for the xenografts of both tumor types. The kplrate constant may be influenced by various factors, and studies with a range of prostate cancer cells in suspension suggest that LDH inhibition by pyruvate may be one of these. Our results indicate that glucose and pyruvate metabolism in the prostate cancer cell models differs from that in other tumor models and that [18F]FDG-PET can serve as a valuable complementary tool in dDNP studies of aggressive prostate cancer with [1-13C]pyruvate.

ABSTRACT:
Tumor microenvironment fibroblasts overexpress the fibroblast activation protein (FAP). We recently reported the preclinical evaluation of [99mTc]Tc-iFAP as a new SPECT radioligand capable of detecting FAP. This research aimed to evaluate the kinetic and dosimetric profile of [99mTc]Tc-iFAP in healthy volunteers, and to assess the radioligand uptake by different solid tumors in three cancer patients. [99mTc]Tc-iFAP was obtained from lyophilized formulations prepared under GMP conditions with >98% radiochemical purity. Whole-body scans of six healthy subjects were obtained at 0.5, 2, 4, and 24 h after [99mTc]Tc-iFAP (740 MBq) administration. A 2D-planar/3D-SPECT hybrid activity quantitation method was used to fit the biokinetic models of the source organs (volume of interest: VOI) as exponential functions (A(t)VOI). The total nuclear transformations (N) that occurred in the source organs were calculated from the mathematical integration (0,∞) of A(t)VOI. The OLINDA code was used to estimate the radiation doses. Three treatment-naive patients (breast, lung, and cervical cancer) with a prior [18F]FDG PET/CT scan underwent whole-body, chest, and abdominal SPECT/CT scanning after [99mTc]Tc-iFAP (740 MBq) administration. Both imaging methods were compared visually and quantitatively. Oncological diagnoses were performed histopathologically. The results showed favorable [99mTc]Tc-iFAP biodistribution and kinetics due to rapid blood activity removal (t1/2α = 2.22 min and t1/2β = 90 min) and mainly renal clearance. The mean radiation equivalent doses were 5.2 ± 0.8 mSv for the kidney and 1.7 ± 0.3 mSv for the liver after administration of 740 MBq. The effective dose was 2.3 ± 0.4 mSv/740 MBq. [99mTc]Tc-iFAP demonstrated high and reliable uptake in the primary tumor lesions and lymph node metastases in patients with breast, cervical, and lung cancer, which correlated with that detected by [18F]FDG PET/CT. The tumor microenvironment molecular imaging from cancer patients obtained in this research validates the performance of additional clinical studies to determine the utility of [99mTc]Tc-iFAP in the diagnosis and prognosis of different types of solid tumors.

TITLE: Insights into the thermal degradation mechanisms of polyethylene terephthalate dimer using DFT method

AUTHORS: Jinbao Huang, Hanxian Meng, Xiaosong Luo, Xin Mu, Weiwei Xu, Li Jin, Baosheng Lai

JOURNAL: Chemosphere

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
The thermal degradation mechanisms of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) dimer were studied by the B3P86 density functional theory (DFT) approach at 6-31++G (d, p) base set in this paper. Seven possible reaction paths were designed and analyzed, and the thermodynamic parameters for all reactions were computed. The calculated results indicate that the bond dissociation energy values (BDEs) of C-C bonds on the main-chain are the smallest, followed by those of C-O bonds. The kinetics analysis indicates that the concerted reactions are obviously liable to occur rather than radical reactions in the initial thermal decomposition process. In the processes of initial reactions, all concerted reactions occurred by six-membered cyclic transition states (TSs) are more prone to carry out than those happened by four-membered cyclic transition states. The research results show that the primary products of PET dimer pyrolysis are terephthalic acid, vinyl terephthalate, CH3CHO and divinyl terephthalate. CH3CHO is mainly formed by a concerted reaction in the initial degradation process, and CO2is mainly produced by the decarboxylation via a concerted reaction and CO is mainly produced by the decarbonylation of a radical in secondary degradation.

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: This study aimed at investigating binding specificity, suitability of reference region-based kinetic modelling, and pharmacokinetics of the metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGluR1) radioligand [11C]ITDM in mice.

Procedures: We performed in vivo blocking as well as displacement of [11C]ITDM during positron emission tomography (PET) imaging using the specific mGluR1 antagonist YM-202074. Additionally, we assessed in vitro blocking of [3H]ITDM at two different doses of YM-202074. As an alternative to reference region models, we validated the use of a noninvasive image-derived input function (IDIF) compared to an arterial input function measured with an invasive arteriovenous (AV) shunt using a population-based curve for radiometabolite correction and characterized the pharmacokinetic modelling of [11C]ITDM in the mouse brain. Finally, we also assessed semi-quantitative approaches.

Results: In vivo blocking with YM-202074 resulted in a decreased [11C]ITDM binding, ranging from - 35.8 ± 8.0 % in pons to - 65.8 ± 3.0 % in thalamus. Displacement was also markedly observed in all tested regions. In addition, in vitro [3H]ITDM binding could be blocked in a dose-dependent manner. The volume of distribution (VT) based on the noninvasive IDIF (VT (IDIF)) showed excellent agreement with the VTvalues based on the metabolite-corrected plasma input function regardless of the metabolite correction (r2> 0.943, p < 0.0001). Two-tissue compartmental model (2TCM) was found to be the preferred model and showed optimal agreement with Logan plot (r2> 0.960, p < 0.0001). A minimum scan duration of 80 min was required for proper parameter estimation. SUV was not reliable (r2= 0.379, p = 0.0011), unlike the SUV ratio to the SUV of the input function, which showed to be a valid approach.

Conclusions: No suitable reference region could be identified for [11C]ITDM as strongly supported by in vivo and in vitro evidence of specific binding in all brain regions. However, by applying appropriate kinetic models, [11C]ITDM PET imaging represents a promising tool to visualize mGluR1 in the mouse brain.

TITLE: Active carbon-based waste packaging materials for uranium sorption from aqueous solution

AUTHORS: Amir Elzoghby, Hager Fahmy, Mohamed Taha, Saber Ibrahim

JOURNAL: Environmental science and pollution research international

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Waste (packaging plastic and industrial water) accumulation is one of the great global challenges over the world. Combining waste recycling science and water treatment knowledge are fascinating as applied sciences add value to the safe disposal of waste plastic packaging materials and wastewater. Active carbons (ACs) are prepared from polyethylene terephthalate (PET) at two pyrolysis temperatures (i.e. 450 and 500 °C) and compressed in well-defined designed molds to form cylinder shapes as applied in industry. Particle size (817 and 1074 nm), zeta potential (- 7.17 and - 25.6 mV), surface area (544 and 632 m2/g), and topography of prepared ACs were investigated and discussed. Zeta potential exhibited nice dispersion in accordance to charge value and surficial SEM images prove space hole filling with adsorbed materials after treatment. The prepared activated carbon sorbents have been applied for the removal of radioactive elements from wastewater. The displayed data declare that both sorbents have the same sorption performance, whereas the uranium sorption process using both sorbents is obeyed to pseudo-second-order kinetic model and Langmuir isotherm model. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that the prepared AC at a pyrolysis temperature of 500 °C exhibits higher sorption capacity (38.9 mg g-1) than that prepared at lower temperature, i.e., 450 °C (36.2 mg g-1) which indicates that the increase in pyrolysis temperature improves the sorption characteristics of the yield-activated carbon.

TITLE: Leveraging machine learning with dynamic 18F-FDG PET/CT: integrating metabolic and flow features for lung cancer differential diagnosis

AUTHORS: Zhiheng Yao, Yubo Wang, Yaping Wu, Jinpeng Zhou, Na Dang, Meiyun Wang, Ying Liang, Tao Sun

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Background: Dynamic 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) PET/CT imaging has been shown to provide additional information for diagnosing lung cancer. The aim of this study was to investigate whether metabolic and flow features directly extracted from time activity curves (TACs) help differentiate between benign and malignant conditions of lung lesions.

Methods: TACs at the primary lesion were extracted from each dynamic 18F-FDG PET/CT scan. The TAC signal was then decomposed into metabolism and blood flow components through kinetic modeling. Dynamic features including area under the curve (AUC), time-to-peak, and slopes were then extracted from each component. The extracted features from 187 patients (mean age, 60.41 ± 11.01 years; 117 males) were used to train a classification model based on bagging, a machine-learning method built with decision trees. The performance of the trained model on differentiating benign and malignant was tested using receiver operating characteristic analysis with cross-validation. External testing was then performed for an independent dataset that consisted of 42 dynamic scans. For the results, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) were used to assess the relative importance of the contributed features for individuals. Waterfall charts were also plotted, together with assessment of Cohen's effect size to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model over SUVmax and the net FDG influx rate Ki.

Results: The combination of the multiple dynamic features was able to separate benign and malignant lesions. For cross-validation, the trained model had an AUC of 0.89, sensitivity of 0.80, and specificity of 0.88, which was significantly higher than that of either SUVmax (AUC = 0.79, DeLong p < 0.001) or Ki(AUC = 0.76, DeLong test p < 0.001). For the testing dataset, the model had an AUC of 0.86, which again was better than either SUVmax (AUC of 0.72) or Ki(AUC of 0.71). The most important features that contributed to the diagnosis identified by SHAP included the slope and maximum metabolism TAC at the lesion, the AUC, and the peak time of blood TAC at the lesion. The waterfall chart illustrated that the model had significantly different prediction scores between the benign and malignant groups (p < 0.001) with a Cohen's effect size of 1.71, which was higher than that of the values for SUV and Ki(Cohen's effect size 0.96 and 0.81, respectively).

Conclusion: An explainable machine learning model that combines dynamic FDG metabolic and flow features can predict benign or malignant lung cancer patients more accurately than conventional parameters such as SUVmax or net influx rate Ki.

JOURNAL: The Science of the total environment

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Plastics are globally used for a variety of benefits. As a consequence of poor recycling or reuse, improperly disposed plastic waste accumulates in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems to a considerable extent. Large plastic waste items become fragmented to small particles through mechanical and (photo)chemical processes. Particles with sizes ranging from millimeter (microplastics, <5 mm) to nanometer (nanoplastics, NP, <100 nm) are apparently persistent and have adverse effects on ecosystems and human health. Current research therefore focuses on whether and to what extent microorganisms or enzymes can degrade these NP. In this study, we addressed the question of what information isothermal titration calorimetry, which tracks the heat of reaction of the chain scission of a polyester, can provide about the kinetics and completeness of the degradation process. The majority of the heat represents the cleavage energy of the ester bonds in polymer backbones providing real-time kinetic information. Calorimetry operates even in complex matrices. Using the example of the cutinase-catalyzed degradation of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) nanoparticles, we found that calorimetry (isothermal titration calorimetry-ITC) in combination with thermokinetic models is excellently suited for an in-depth analysis of the degradation processes of NP. For instance, we can separately quantify i) the enthalpy of surface adsorption ∆AdsH = 129 ± 2 kJ mol-1, ii) the enthalpy of the cleavage of the ester bonds ∆EBH = -58 ± 1.9 kJ mol-1and the apparent equilibrium constant of the enzyme substrate complex K = 0.046 ± 0.015 g L-1. It could be determined that the heat production of PET NP degradation depends to 95% on the reaction heat and only to 5% on the adsorption heat. The fact that the percentage of cleaved ester bonds (η = 12.9 ± 2.4%) is quantifiable with the new method is of particular practical importance. The new method promises a quantification of enzymatic and microbial adsorption to NP and their degradation in mimicked real-world aquatic conditions.

TITLE: Determining the optimal pharmacokinetic modelling and simplified quantification method of [18F]AlF-P16-093 for patients with primary prostate cancer (PPCa)

AUTHORS: Ruiyue Zhao, Zeheng Xia, Miao Ke, Jie Lv, Huizhen Zhong, Yulu He, Di Gu, Yongda Liu, Guohua Zeng, Lin Zhu, David Alexoff, Hank F Kung, Xinlu Wang, Tao Sun

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: This paper discusses the optimization of pharmacokinetic modelling and alternate simplified quantification method for [18F]AlF-P16-093, a novel tracer for in vivo imaging of prostate cancer.

Methods: Dynamic PET/CT scans were conducted on eight primary prostate cancer patients, followed by a whole-body scan at 60 min post-injection. Time-activity curves (TACs) were obtained by drawing volumes of interest for primary prostatic and metastatic lesions. Optimal kinetic modelling involved evaluating three compartmental models (1T2K, 2T3K, and 2T4K) accounting for fractional blood volume (Vb). The simplified quantification method was then determined based on the correlation between the static uptake measure and total distribution volume (Vt) obtained from the optimal pharmacokinetic analysis.

Results: In total, 17 intraprostatic lesions, 10 lymph nodes, and 36 osseous metastases were evaluated. Visually, the contrast of the tumor increased and showed the steepest incline within the first few minutes, whereas background activity decreased over time. Full pharmacokinetic analysis revealed that a reversible two-compartmental (2T4K) model is the preferred kinetic model for the given tracer. The kinetic parameters K1, k3, Vb, and Vtwere all significantly higher in lesions when compared with normal tissue (P < 0.01). Several simplified protocols were tested for approximating comprehensive dynamic quantification in tumors, with image-based SURmean (the ratio of tumor SUVmean to blood SUVmean) within the 28-34 min window found to be sufficient for approximating the total distribution Vtvalues (R2= 0.949, P < 0.01). Both Vtand SURmean correlated significantly with the total serum prostate-specific antigen (tPSA) levels (P < 0.01).

Conclusions: This study introduced an optimized pharmacokinetic modelling approach and a simplified acquisition method for [18F]AlF-P16-093, a novel PSMA-targeted radioligand, highlighting the feasibility of utilizing one static PET imaging (between 30 and 60 min) for the diagnosis of prostate cancer. Note that the image-derived input function in this study may not reflect the true corrected plasma input function, therefore the interpretation of the associated kinetic parameter estimates should be done with caution.

AUTHORS: Dorin Stanica-Ezeanu, Danuta Matei

JOURNAL: Scientific reports

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is one of the most widely used materials for food packaging and fishing nets. After use it become waste and, due to poor collection, most will be found floating in marine waters. This paper presents the results of a study of PET depolymerization by hydrolysis. We observed that marine water is a perfect reactant because it contains a multitude of metal ions that act as catalysts. A first-order kinetic model was developed and experimental data fitted to it. An activation energy of 73.5 kJ/mole and a pre-exponential factor of 5.33 × 107h-1were obtained. Considering that the global ocean is a huge batch reactor operating under isothermal conditions, the solution of the mathematical model shows that in tropical regions only 72 years is needed for total and only 4.5 years for 50% PET conversion.

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of mutant huntingtin (mHTT) aggregates is a potential tool to monitor disease progression as well as the efficacy of candidate therapeutic interventions for Huntington's disease (HD). To date, the focus has been mainly on the investigation of11C radioligands; however, favourable18F radiotracers will facilitate future clinical translation. This work aimed at characterising the novel [18F]CHDI-650 PET radiotracer using a combination of in vivo and in vitro approaches in a mouse model of HD.

Methods: After characterising [18F]CHDI-650 using in vitro autoradiography, we assessed in vivo plasma and brain radiotracer stability as well as kinetics through dynamic PET imaging in the heterozygous (HET) zQ175DN mouse model of HD and wild-type (WT) littermates at 9 months of age. Additionally, we performed a head-to-head comparison study at 3 months with the previously published [11C]CHDI-180R radioligand.

Results: Plasma and brain radiometabolite profiles indicated a suitable metabolic profile for in vivo imaging of [18F]CHDI-650. Both in vitro autoradiography and in vivo [18F]CHDI-650 PET imaging at 9 months of age demonstrated a significant genotype effect (p < 0.0001) despite the poor test-retest reliability. [18F]CHDI-650 PET imaging at 3 months of age displayed higher differentiation between genotypes when compared to [11C]CHDI-180R.

Conclusion: Overall, [18F]CHDI-650 allows for discrimination between HET and WT zQ175DN mice at 9 and 3 months of age. [18F]CHDI-650 represents the first suitable18F radioligand to image mHTT aggregates in mice and its clinical evaluation is underway.

TITLE: Management of ibuprofen in wastewater using electrospun nanofibers developed from PET and PS wastes

AUTHORS: Alaa M Amer, S I El-Dek, A A Farghali, Nabila Shehata

JOURNAL: Chemosphere

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Electrospinning is a promising technique for the beneficial use and recycling of plastic waste polymers using simple methodologies. In this study, plastic bottles and Styrofoam wastes have been used to develop polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polystyrene (PS) nanofibers using electrospinning technique separately without any further purification. The effect of the concentration onto the nanofiber's morphology was studied. The fabricated nanofibers were characterized using Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FE-SEM), Fourier Transformed Infrared Spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), N2adsorption/desorption analysis, and water contact angle (WCA). Furthermore, the prepared nanofibers were applied for the adsorption of ibuprofen (IBU) from wastewater. Some parameters that can influence the adsorption efficiency of nanofibers such as solution pH, wt.% of prepared nanofibers, drug initial concentration, and contact time were studied and optimized. The results show that the equilibrium adsorption capacity was achieved after only 10 min for 12 wt% PET nanofibers which is equivalent to 364.83 mg/g. For 12 wt% PS nanofibers, an equilibrium adsorption capacity of 328.42 mg/g was achieved in 30 min. The experimental data was fitted to five isotherm and four kinetics models to understand the complicated interaction between the nanofibers and the drug. Langmuir-Freundlich isotherm model showed the best fit for experimental data for both PET and PS nanofibers. The adsorption process was characterized by predominantly physical reaction rather than chemical adsorption for both materials. The reusability study revealed that the synthesized nanofibers maintain their ability to adsorb/desorb IBU for up to five cycles. The results obtained demonstrated that fabricated nanofibers from plastic wastes could perform promising adsorbents for the management of IBU in wastewater. However, further research is needed for the scaling-up the fabrication which is required for real-world applications.

AUTHORS: Lidia Miguel Telega, Raissa Berti, Ganna Blazhenets, Lisa-Charlotte Domogalla, Nils Steinacker, M Aymen Omrane, Philipp T Meyer, Volker A Coenen, Ann-Christin Eder, Máté D Döbrössy

JOURNAL: Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Background: Reserpine (RES), a Vesicular Monoamine Transporter 2 (VMAT2) inhibitor agent, has been used in preclinical research for many years to create animal models for depression and to test experimental antidepressant strategies. Nevertheless, evidence of the potential use and validity of RES as a chronic pharmacological model for depression is lacking, and there are no comprehensive studies of the behavioral effects in conjunction with molecular outcomes.

Methods: Experiment 1. Following baseline behavior testing sensitive to depression-like phenotype and locomotion (Phase 1), 27 Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats received i.p. either vehicle solution (0.0 mg/kg), low (0.2 mg/kg) or high (0.8 mg/kg) RES dose for 20 days using a pre-determined schedule and reassessed for behavioral phenotypes (Phase 2). After 10 days washout period, and a final behavioral assessment (Phase 3), the brains were collected 16 days after the last injection for mRNA-expression assessment. Experiment 2. In a similar timetable as in Experiment 1 but without the behavioral testing, 12 SD rats underwent repetitive dopamine D2/3receptor PET scanning with [18F]DMFP following each Phase. The binding potential (BPND) of [18F]DMFP was quantified by kinetic analysis as a marker of striatal D2/3R availability. Weight and welfare were monitored throughout the study.

Results: Significant, dose-dependent weight loss and behavioral deficits including both motor (hypo-locomotion) and non-motor behavior (anhedonia, mild anxiety and reduced exploration) were found for both the low and high dose groups with significant decrease in D2R mRNA expression in the accumbal region for the low RES group after Phase 3. Both RES treated groups showed substantial increase in [18F]DMFP BPND(in line with dopamine depletion) during Phase 2 and 3 compared to baseline and Controls.

Conclusions: The longitudinal design of the study demonstrated that chronic RES administration induced striatal dopamine depletion that persisted even after the wash-out period. However, the behavior phenotype observed were transient. The data suggest that RES administration can induce a rodent model for depression with mild face validity.

TITLE: The brain's "dark energy" puzzle upgraded: [18F]FDG uptake, delivery and phosphorylation, and their coupling with resting-state brain activity

ABSTRACT:
The brain's resting-state energy consumption is expected to be driven by spontaneous activity. We previously used 50 resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) features to predict [18F]FDG SUVR as a proxy of glucose metabolism. Here, we expanded on our effort by estimating [18F]FDG kinetic parametersKi(irreversible uptake),K1(delivery),k3(phosphorylation) in a large healthy control group (n = 47). Describing the parameters' spatial distribution at high resolution (216 regions), we showed thatK1is the least redundant (strong posteromedial pattern), andKiandk3have relevant differences (occipital cortices, cerebellum, thalamus). Using multilevel modeling, we investigated how much spatial variance of [18F]FDG parameters could be explained by a combination of a) rs-fMRI variables, b) cerebral blood flow (CBF) and metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) from15O PET. Rs-fMRI-only models explained part of the individual variance inKi(35%),K1(14%),k3(21%), while combining rs-fMRI and CMRO2led to satisfactory description ofKi(46%) especially.Kiwas sensitive to both local rs-fMRI variables (ReHo) and CMRO2,k3toReHo,K1to CMRO2. This work represents a comprehensive assessment of the complex underpinnings of brain glucose consumption, and highlights links between 1) glucose phosphorylation and local brain activity, 2) glucose delivery and oxygen consumption.

TITLE: Characteristics of ball-milled PET plastic char for the adsorption of different types of aromatic organic pollutants

AUTHORS: Hyokchol Mun, Cholnam Ri, Qinglong Liu, Jingchun Tang

JOURNAL: Environmental science and pollution research international

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Ball-milled plastic char (BMPC) was manufactured by ball-milling of native plastic char (PC) that was synthesized via slow pyrolysis of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) water bottle waste, and its adsorption characteristics of aqueous phenanthrene (PHE), phenol, and 2,4,6-trichlorophenol (2,4,6-TCP) and its possible mechanisms were investigated. With the increase of PC pyrolysis temperature, the specific surface area of BMPC increased obviously, forming larger functional groups compared to PC. Boehm titration showed that total acidic groups of BMPC decreased significantly with the increase of pyrolysis temperature. The sorption kinetics of three adsorbates was adequately simulated by pseudo-second-order model (R2> 0.99). Langmuir model fitted well the adsorption isotherms of PHE and phenol, while Freundlich model simulated the adsorption isotherm of 2,4,6-TCP better. The adsorption amount of PHE, phenol, and 2,4,6-TCP increased significantly as the pyrolysis temperature increased. The maximum BMPC adsorption capacity reached 21.9 mg·g-1(for PHE), 106 mg·g-1(for phenol), and 303 mg·g-1(for 2,4,6-TCP) at 25 °C in aqueous solution. FTIR analysis suggested that surface sorption-based π-π interaction was a dominant mechanism of PHE adsorption; meanwhile, H-bonding between O-containing groups on BMPC and hydroxyl groups of adsorbates was responsible for phenol and 2,4,6-TCP removal. This paper shows that BMPC can be used as adsorbent for treating aromatic compounds in aqueous environment and has an economic worth of application.

ABSTRACT:
Neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), composed of aggregated tau protein, in the brain is a neuropathological hallmark and feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other tauopathies. One promising approach to prevent tau aggregates is to inhibit O-GlcNAcase (OGA), an enzyme that regulates tau O-GlcNAcylation. [11C]BIO-1819578 has emerged as a promising candidate to determine target occupancy of such OGA inhibitor drugs. The aim of this study was to further evaluate the pharmacokinetic properties of [11C]BIO-1819578 in non-human primates (NHPs) and to estimate its effective dose. Kinetic compartment analyses of [11C]BIO-1819578 binding to OGA in the brain were performed on positron emission tomography (PET) measurements conducted in three cynomolgus NHPs. Whole-body PET measurements were carried out in two NHPs to estimate the effective radiation dose. Both the 1-tissue-compartment (1TCM) and 2-tissue-compartment model (2TCM) could describe the regional time activity curves of [11C]BIO-1819578. The 2TCM was the statistically preferred model. The effective radiation dose was estimated to be 0.0033 mSv/MBq. The results showed that [11C]BIO-1819578 has suitable characteristics for reliable quantification of OGA using full kinetic modelling. The effective dose was on par with other11C radioligands and is unlikely to pose an issue for human use.

TITLE: Renewable Fuels and Chemical Recycling of Plastics via Hydrothermal Liquefaction

AUTHORS: Phillip E Savage

JOURNAL: Accounts of chemical research

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
ConspectusHydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) converts a wide range of biomass feedstocks into a renewable bio-oil via reactions in hot, compressed water. Other products that form partition into the gas, aqueous, or solid phases. The reactions taking place during HTL include hydrolysis, decarboxylation, condensations, additions, deamination, and dehydration. Bio-oil production from HTL has been demonstrated for many renewable materials including microalgae, macroalgae, sludge from water treatment, food waste, agricultural residues, bacteria, yeast, and a wide variety of lignocellulosic materials. HTL of whole biomass is an energy densification process as it generally recovers about 70-80% of chemical energy in an oil product that is just 20-50 wt % of the mass of the original feedstock. The oil is typically rich in oxygen (10 -20 wt %) and also in nitrogen (about 5 wt %), if the biomass contains protein. The oil also contains metals such as iron. Therefore, an upgrading and/or refining process would be required to convert the crude bio-oil to a finished fuel. Each biochemical component in biomass (e.g., polysaccharides, protein, lipids, lignin) contributes different proportions of its initial mass to biocrude. Lipids provide the highest biocrude yields whereas polysaccharides and lignin provide the lowest. Kinetics models have been developed that incorporate different reactivities for the different biochemical components. These models, which are effective in correlating and predicting the yields of biocrude and other product fractions from HTL, can be used in technoeconomic analysis and life-cycle assessments to advance commercial adoption of the technology.HTL is also effective in producing an oil product from decomposition of many different plastics. Thus, it can be used for chemical recycling or valorization of post-consumer waste plastics. Polyolefins and polycarbonates can give oil yields exceeding 90 wt %. Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) gives very low oil yields. The major product from PET hydrolysis, terephthalic acid, is a solid at room temperature and not soluble in the organic solvents typically used to recover oil.Hydrothermal decomposition of isolated biochemical components of biomass and individual synthetic polymers provides insights into the governing chemical reaction pathways. Results from such experiments also enable development of component additivity models that can predict oil yields and other outcomes from HTL of biomass, plastics, and their mixtures.Research needs in this field include more detailed, molecular-level kinetics models, experimental work on HTL and hydrolysis of the many synthetic plastics that have not yet been adequately explored, and experiments and modeling for mixtures of different plastics and mixtures of plastics with biomass.

TITLE: Self-supervised parametric map estimation for multiplexed PET with a deep image prior

AUTHORS: Bolin Pan, Paul K Marsden, Andrew J Reader

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Multiplexed positron emission tomography (mPET) imaging allows simultaneous observation of physiological and pathological information from multiple tracers in a single PET scan. Although supervised deep learning has demonstrated superior performance in mPET image separation compared to purely model-based methods, acquiring large amounts of paired single-tracer data and multi-tracer data for training poses a practical challenge and needs extended scan durations for patients. In addition, the generalisation ability of the supervised learning framework is a concern, as the patient being scanned and their tracer kinetics may potentially fall outside the training distribution. In this work, we propose a self-supervised learning framework based on the deep image prior (DIP) for mPET image separation using just one dataset. In particular, we integrate the multi-tracer compartmental model into the DIP framework to estimate the parametric maps of each tracer from the measured dynamic dual-tracer activity images. Consequently, the separated dynamic single-tracer activity images can be recovered from the estimated tracer-specific parametric maps. In the proposed method, dynamic dual-tracer activity images are used as the training label, and the static dual-tracer image (reconstructed from the same patient data from the start to the end of acquisition) is used as the network input. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated on a simulated brain phantom for dynamic dual-tracer [18F]FDG+[11C]MET activity image separation and parametric map estimation. The results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the conventional voxel-wise multi-tracer compartmental modeling method (vMTCM) and the two-step method DIP-Dn+vMTCM (where dynamic dual-tracer activity images are first denoised using a U-net within the DIP framework, followed by vMTCM separation) in terms of lower bias and standard deviation in the separated single-tracer images and also for the estimated parametric maps for each tracer, at both voxel and ROI levels.

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Fluctuations of neuronal activities in the brain may underlie relatively slow components of neurofunctional alterations, which can be modulated by food intake and related systemic metabolic statuses. Glutamatergic neurotransmission plays a major role in the regulation of excitatory tones in the central nervous system, although just how dietary elements contribute to the tuning of this system remains elusive. Here, we provide the first demonstration by bimodal positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) that metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5 (mGluR5) ligand binding and glutamate levels in human brains are dynamically altered in a manner dependent on food intake and consequent changes in plasma glucose levels. The brain-wide modulations of central mGluR5 ligand binding and glutamate levels and profound neuronal activations following systemic glucose administration were further proven by PET, MRS, and intravital two-photon microscopy, respectively, in living rodents. The present findings consistently support the notion that food-associated glucose intake is mechanistically linked to glutamatergic tones in the brain, which are translationally accessiblein vivoby bimodal PET and MRS measurements in both clinical and non-clinical settings.

TITLE: Co-pyrolysis characteristic of sugarcane waste with polyethylene terephthalate: thermal decomposition, product distribution, synergistic effect, and kinetics analysis

AUTHORS: Hamizura Hassan, Bassim H Hameed

JOURNAL: Environmental science and pollution research international

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
This work has focused on the co-pyrolysis of sugarcane waste (SW) with polyethylene terephthalate (PET) to gain insight on its thermal decomposition, product distribution, kinetics, and synergistic effect. SW and PET were blended at different ratios (100:0, 80:20, 60:40, 40:60, and 0:100), and the Coats-Redfern method was used to determine the kinetics parameters. To ascertain the synergistic effect between SW and PET, product yields and composition of chemicals were compared with the synergistic effect of the individual components of pyrolysis. The bio-oil yield was significant at 60% of PET, with a difference of 19.41 wt% compared to the theoretical value. The synergistic impact of SW:PET on ester formation and acid compound inhibition was the most dominant at the 60:40 ratio. The kinetics analysis revealed that the diffusion mechanism, power law, and order of reactions were the most probable reaction models that can explain the pyrolysis of SW, and PET, and their blends. The resultant co-pyrolysis oil contained slightly larger hydrogen and carbon contents with low oxygen, and sulphur, and nitrogen contents, which improved the quality of the bio-oil. The results of this work could be used as a guide in selecting proper reaction conditions with optimal synergy during the co-pyrolysis process.

JOURNAL: Current neuropharmacology

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Introduction: In vitrodata from primates provide conflicting evidence about the suitability of the cerebellum as a reference region for quantifying type 5 metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR5) binding parameters with positron emission tomography (PET).

Methods: We first measured mGluR5 density in postmortem human cerebellum using [3H]ABP688 autoradiography (n=5) and immunohistochemistry (n=6). Next, in vivo experiments were conducted in healthy volunteers (n=6) using a high-resolution PET scanner (HRRT) to compare [11C]ABP688 binding potential (BPND) values obtained with reference tissue methods and the two-tissue compartment model vs. metabolite-corrected arterial input function.

Results: The postmortem data showed that, relative to the hippocampus, the cerebellum had 35% less mGluR5 immunoreactivity and 94% fewer [3H]ABP688 binding sites.In vivobrain regional [11C]ABP688 BPNDvalues using the cerebellum as a reference region were highly correlated with BPND values and distribution volumes derived by arterial input methods (R2> 0.9).

Conclusion: The scarce availability of cerebellar allosteric binding sites at autoradiography, compared to immunohistochemistry results, might reflect the presence of distinct mGluR5 isoforms or conformational state. Together with our PET data, these data support the proposition that [11C]ABP688 BPND using the cerebellum as a reference region provides accurate quantification of mGluR5 allosteric binding in vivo. Studies relying on this method could, therefore, be used in clinical populations, providing that stronger initial assumptions are met.

TITLE: Solving two environmental problems simultaneously：Microporous carbon derived from mixed plastic waste for CO2 capture

AUTHORS: Xiaoli Zhou, Liyao Zhu, Weiliang Dong, Min Jiang

JOURNAL: Chemosphere

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Conversion of plastic waste into porous carbon for CO2capture is an attractive approach to solve the carbon emission and plastic pollution problems, simultaneously. However, the previous studies are limited to the utilization of single PET plastic. The conversion of mixed plastic waste (MPW), which is of more practical significance, is seldom reported. In this study, mixed plastic waste was converted into porous carbon materials for CO2capture through cascading autogenic pressure carbonization (APC) and chemical activation. The carbon yield of 56% was achieved through APC of MPW. The activator (KOH) dosage had significant effects on the structure and properties of the prepared porous carbons. Porous carbon prepared with KOH/C ratio of 4 had the largest micropore area and the maximum CO2adsorption was 2.7 mmol g-1at 298 K and 1 bar. The experimental data were well fitted to the pesudo first-order kinetic model. The MPW derived porous carbon exhibited not only high CO2uptake capacity, but also fast adsorption rate, good selectivity of CO2over N2and good cyclic stability, which could be regarded as a promising adsorbent for CO2adsorption.

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Obtaining the arterial input function (AIF) is essential for quantitative regional cerebral perfusion (rCBF) measurements using [15O]H2O PET. However, arterial blood sampling is invasive and complicates the scanning procedure. We propose a new non-invasive dual scan technique with an image derived input function (IDIF) from an additional heart scan. Six patients and two healthy subjects underwent [15O]H2O PET imaging of 1) heart and brain during baseline, and 2) heart and brain after infusion of acetazolamide. The IDIF was extracted from the left ventricle of the heart and compared to the AIF. The rCBF was compared for six bilateral cortical regions. AIFs and IDIFs showed strong agreement. rCBF with AIF and IDIF showed strong correlation for both baseline rCBF (R2= 0.99, slope = 0.89 CI: [0.87; 0.91], p < 0.0001) and acetazolamide rCBF (R2= 0.98, slope = 0.93, CI:[0.90;0.97], p < 0.0001) but showed a positive bias of 0.047 mL/(g·min) [-0.025; +0.119] for baseline and 0.024 [-1.04, +1.53] mL/(g·min) for acetazolamide. In conclusion, the invasive arterial cannulation can be replaced by an additional scan of the heart with a minor bias of rCBF estimation. The method is applicable to all scanner systems.

TITLE: Functional characterization and structural insights of three cutinases from the ascomycete Fusarium verticillioides

AUTHORS: Caroline Torres de Oliveira, Michelle Alexandrino de Assis, João Paulo Lourenço Franco Cairo, André Damasio, Gonçalo Amarante Guimarães Pereira, Marcio Antonio Mazutti, Débora de Oliveira

JOURNAL: Protein expression and purification

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Cutinases are serine esterases that belong to the α/β hydrolases superfamily. The natural substrates for these enzymes are cutin and suberin, components of the plant cuticle, the first barrier in the defense system against pathogen invasion. It is well-reported that plant pathogens produce cutinases to facilitate infection. Fusarium verticillioides, one important corn pathogens, is an ascomycete upon which its cutinases are poorly explored. Consequently, the objective of this study was to perform the biochemical characterization of three precursor cutinases (FvCut1, FvCut2, and FvCut3) from F. verticillioides and to obtain structural insights about them. The cutinases were produced in Escherichia coli and purified. FvCut1, FvCut2, and FvCut3 presented optimal temperatures of 20, 40, and 35 °C, and optimal pH of 9, 7, and 8, respectively. Some chemicals stimulated the enzymatic activity. The kinetic parameters revealed that FvCut1 has higher catalytic efficiency (Kcat/Km) in the p-nitrophenyl-butyrate (p-NPB) substrate. Nevertheless, the enzymes were not able to hydrolyze polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Furthermore, the three-dimensional models of these enzymes showed structural differences among them, mainly FvCut1, which presented a narrower opening cleft to access the catalytic site. Therefore, our study contributes to exploring the diversity of fungal cutinases and their potential biotechnological applications.

TITLE: Assessing dynamic metabolic heterogeneity in prostate cancer patients via total-body [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT imaging: quantitative analysis of [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 uptake in pathological lesions and normal organs

AUTHORS: Ruohua Chen, Yee Ling Ng, Xinlan Yang, Yinjie Zhu, Lianghua Li, Haitao Zhao, Gang Huang, Jianjun Liu

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: This study aimed to quantitatively assess [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 uptake in pathological lesions and normal organs in prostate cancer using the total-body [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT and to characterize the dynamic metabolic heterogeneity of prostate cancer.

Methods: Dynamic total-body [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT scans were performed on ten prostate cancer patients. Manual delineation of volume-of-interests (VOIs) was performed on multiple normal organs displaying high [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 uptake, as well as pathological lesions. Time-to-activity curves (TACs) were generated, and the four compartment models including one-tissue compartmental model (1T1k), reversible one-tissue compartmental model (1T2k), irreversible two-tissue compartment model (2T3k) and reversible two-tissue compartmental model (2T4k) were fitted to each tissue TAC. Various rate constants, including K1(forward transport rate from plasma to the reversible compartment), k2(reverse transport rate from the reversible compartment to plasma), k3(tracer binding on the PSMA-receptor and its internalization), k4(the externalization rate of the tracer) and Ki(net influx rate), were obtained. The selection of the optimal model for describing the uptake of both lesions and normal organs was determined using the Akaike information criteria (AIC). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to determine the cut-off values for differentiating physiological and pathological [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 uptake.

Results: Both 1T1k and 1T2k models showed relatively high AIC values compared to the 2T3k and 2T4k models in both pathological lesions and normal organs. The kinetic behavior of pathological lesions was better described by the 2T3k model compared to the 2T4k model, while the normal organs were better described by the 2T4k model. Significant variations in kinetic metrics, such as K1, k2, and k3, and Ki, were observed among normal organs with high [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 uptake and pathological lesions. The high Kivalue in normal organs was primarily determined by elevated K1and low k3, rather than k2. Conversely, the high Kivalue in pathological lesions, ranking second to the kidney and similar to salivary glands and spleen, was predominantly determined by the highest k3value. Notably, k3exhibited the highest performance in distinguishing between physiological and pathological [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 uptake, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.844 (95% CI, 0.773-0.915), sensitivity of 82.9%, and specificity of 74.1%. The k3values showed better performance than SUVmean (AUC, 0.659), SUVmax (AUC, 0.637), and other kinetic parameter including K1(AUC, 0.604), k2(AUC, 0.634), and Ki(AUC, 0.651).

Conclusions: Significant discrepancies in kinetic metrics were detected between pathological lesions and normal organs, despite their shared high uptake of [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11. Notably, the k3value exhibits a noteworthy capability to distinguish between pathological lesions and normal organs with elevated [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 uptake. This discovery implies that k3holds promise as a prospective imaging biomarker for distinguishing between pathologic and non-specific [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 uptake in patients with prostate cancer.

TITLE: Impact of tracer uptake rate on quantification accuracy of myocardial blood flow in PET: A simulation study

AUTHORS: Xiaotong Hong, Amirhossein Sanaat, Yazdan Salimi, René Nkoulou, Hossein Arabi, Lijun Lu, Habib Zaidi

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Background: Cardiac perfusion PET is commonly used to assess ischemia and cardiovascular risk, which enables quantitative measurements of myocardial blood flow (MBF) through kinetic modeling. However, the estimation of kinetic parameters is challenging due to the noisy nature of short dynamic frames and limited sample data points.

Purpose: This work aimed to investigate the errors in MBF estimation in PET through a simulation study and to evaluate different parameter estimation approaches, including a deep learning (DL) method.

Materials and methods: Simulated studies were generated using digital phantoms based on cardiac segmentations from 55 clinical CT images. We employed the irreversible 2-tissue compartmental model and simulated dynamic13N-ammonia PET scans under both rest and stress conditions (220 cases each). The simulations covered a rest K1range of 0.6 to 1.2 and a stress K1range of 1.2 to 3.6 (unit: mL/min/g) in the myocardium. A transformer-based DL model was trained on the simulated dataset to predict parametric images (PIMs) from noisy PET image frames and was validated using 5-fold cross-validation. We compared the DL method with the voxel-wise nonlinear least squares (NLS) fitting applied to the dynamic images, using either Gaussian filter (GF) smoothing (GF-NLS) or a dynamic nonlocal means (DNLM) algorithm for denoising (DNLM-NLS). Two patients with coronary CT angiography (CTA) and fractional flow reserve (FFR) were enrolled to test the feasibility of applying DL models on clinical PET data.

Results: The DL method showed clearer image structures with reduced noise compared to the traditional NLS-based methods. In terms of mean absolute relative error (MARE), as the rest K1values increased from 0.6 to 1.2 mL/min/g, the overall bias in myocardium K1estimates decreased from approximately 58% to 45% for the NLS-based methods while the DL method showed a reduction in MARE from 42% to 18%. For stress data, as the stress K1decreased from 3.6 to 1.2 mL/min/g, the MARE increased from 30% to 70% for the GF-NLS method. In contrast, both the DNLM-NLS (average: 42%) and the DL methods (average: 20%) demonstrated significantly smaller MARE changes as stress K1varied. Regarding the regional mean bias (±standard deviation), the GF-NLS method had a bias of 6.30% (±8.35%) of rest K1, compared to 1.10% (±8.21%) for DNLM-NLS and 6.28% (±14.05%) for the DL method. For the stress K1, the GF-NLS showed a mean bias of 10.72% (±9.34%) compared to 1.69% (±8.82%) for DNLM-NLS and -10.55% (±9.81%) for the DL method.

Significance: This study showed that an increase in the tracer uptake rate (K1) corresponded to improved accuracy and precision in MBF quantification, whereas lower tracer uptake resulted in higher noise in dynamic PET and poorer parameter estimates. Utilizing denoising techniques or DL approaches can mitigate noise-induced bias in PET parametric imaging.

TITLE: Adsorption/desorption of mercury (II) by artificially weathered microplastics: Kinetics, isotherms, and influencing factors

AUTHORS: Zhiqiang Gao, James V Cizdziel, Kendall Wontor, Boluwatife S Olubusoye

JOURNAL: Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
While both mercury (Hg) and microplastics (MPs) are well-studied global pollutants, comparatively little is known about the interactions between them and the mobilization of Hg from MPs into organisms. We examined the affinity of Hg(II) to artificially weathered MPs, including polyamide (w-PA), polyethylene (w-PE), polyethylene terephthalate (w-PET), polyester fibers (w-PEST), polyvinyl chloride (w-PVC), and polylactic acid (w-PLA), along with crumb rubber (CR) and PE collected from a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP-PE). WWTP-PE, CR, and w-PEST had particularly high Hg(II) affinities, which can be attributed to electrostatic interaction and pore filling. The adsorption followed a pseudo-second-order kinetic process and fitted the Freundlich model, suggesting multi-step (mass transfer and intraparticle diffusion) and heterogeneous adsorptions. Hydrochemical conditions (pH, dissolved organic matter (DOM), salinity and co-existent metal ions) all impacted Hg-MP behavior. Changes in Hg speciation and MP surface properties contributed to the different Hg(II) adsorption capacities for the MPs. Weathering of MPs generally increased the adsorption of Hg(II) onto MPs, but CR, PET and PEST did not follow this trend. Less than 3% of adsorbed Hg(II) was mobilized from the MPs in freshwater, but that increased up to 73% under simulated avian digestive conditions, suggesting increased bioavailability of Hg(II) from ingested MPs. Overall, weathered MPs adsorb and retain Hg(II) under environmentally relevant conditions but desorb much of it in simulated avian digestion fluid, suggesting that birds that ingest MPs may have increased Hg(II) exposure.

JOURNAL: Enzyme and microbial technology

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Dienelactone hydrolase (DLH) is one of numerous hydrolytic enzymes with an α/β-hydrolase fold, which catalyze the hydrolysis of dienelactone to maleylacetate. The DLHs share remarkably similar tertiary structures and a conserved arrangement of catalytic residues. This study presents the crystal structure and comprehensive functional characterization of a novel thermostable DLH from the bacterium Hydrogenobacter thermophilus (HtDLH). The crystal structure of the HtDLH, solved at a resolution of about 1.67 Å, exhibits a canonical α/β-hydrolase fold formed by eight β-sheet strands in the core, with one buried α-helix and six others exposed to the solvent. The structure also confirmed the conserved catalytic triad of DHLs formed by Cys121, Asp170, and His202 residues. The HtDLH forms stable homodimers in solution. Functional studies showed that HtDLH has the expected esterase activity over esters with short carbon chains, such as p-nitrophenyl acetate, reaching optimal activity at pH 7.5 and 70 °C. Furthermore, HtDLH maintains more than 50 % of its activity even after incubation at 90 °C for 16 h. Interestingly, HtDLH exhibits catalytic activity towards polyethylene terephthalate (PET) monomers, including bis-1,2-hydroxyethyl terephthalate (BHET) and 1-(2-hydroxyethyl) 4-methyl terephthalate, as well as other aliphatic and aromatic esters. These findings associated with the lack of activity on amorphous PET indicate that HtDLH has characteristic of a BHET-degrading enzyme. This work expands our understanding of enzyme families involved in PET degradation, providing novel insights for plastic biorecycling through protein engineering, which could lead to eco-friendly solutions to reduce the accumulation of plastic in landfills and natural environments.

JOURNAL: EJNMMI research

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Background: Histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) is an enzyme pivotal for gene regulation, influencing cellular pathways through protein deacetylation. HDAC6 is a potential therapeutic target in diseases such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. Koole et al. investigated brain binding of [18F]Bavarostat, an HDAC6 inhibitor, in healthy participants, revealing an absolute test-retest variability (aTRV) of 7.7% (n = 4) for the distribution volume (VT) with a 1-day interscan interval. This study aims to evaluate test-retest reproducibility with a more extended interscan interval.

Results: Six participants (3 M/3F) underwent a test-retest scan, each lasting for 120 min using a 4-ring Biograph mCT PET/CT scanner. Arterial blood sampling and metabolite analysis were performed to derive the input function. The two scans were 28 ± 12 days apart (14-43 days, n = 6). Regional time-activity curves (TACs) were generated for 15 regions of interest (ROIs). Kinetic analysis of the 120-min TACs was performed using one-tissue and two-tissue compartment models (1TC, 2TC) and multilinear analysis-1 (MA1) to quantify VTvalues and compute absolute test-retest variability (aTRV). The effects of scan duration (60 to 120 min) and MA1 t* setting on aTRV and bias were investigated. Careful analysis of the plasma HPLC data was needed since metabolites eluted close in time to the parent. The MA1 model (t* = 40 min) adequately described regional TACs and produced stable kinetic parameters with good agreement to 2TC (MA1 VT=0.98 × 2TC VT+ 0.48, bias: -0.1%) while 1TC underestimated VTby 5.1%. Regional VTvalues exhibited a relatively uniform pattern, highest in the amygdala and lowest in the centrum semiovale. Individual aTRV values ranged from 2 to 9%. Scan durations between 100 and 120 min provided the most consistent results, with minimal bias and acceptable aTRV across all tested t* values. Although a 90-minute scan with t*=10 or 20-minute balanced scan time and aTRV, optimal parameters varied by brain region. Smaller regions (e.g., amygdala) required longer scans to achieve reliable VTquantification.

Conclusions: The test-retest variability of [18F]Bavarostat VTvalues demonstrated favorable results for a one-month scan interval, comparable to the reported values.

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Objective.This study aims to address the issue of long scan durations required by traditional graphical analysis methods, such as the Logan plot and its variant, the reversible equilibrium (RE) Logan plot, for dynamic PET imaging of tracer kinetics.Approach.We propose a relative RE Logan model that builds on the principles of the Logan plot and its variant to significantly reduce scan time without compromising the accuracy of tracer kinetics analysis. The model is supported by theoretical evidence and experimental validations, including two computer simulations and one clinical data analysis.Main results.The proposed model demonstrates a significant linear relationship between the variablexand the slopeof the RE Logan plot, and the variablex' and the slopeDVT'of the relative RE Logan plot. The Pearson correlation coefficients (r) of the linear fitting of thex' to thexequal 0.9849 in the simulated data and 0.9912 in the clinical data. Similarly, thervalues for the linear fitting ofDVT'toequal 0.9989 and 0.9988 in the simulated data, and 0.9954 in the clinical data.Significance.These results demonstrate the model's capability to maintain strong linear relationships and produce parametric images comparable to the traditional RE Logan plot, but with the considerable advantage of shorter scan durations. This innovation holds significant potential for enhancing the efficiency and feasibility of PET imaging in clinical settings.

TITLE: Numerical simulation method for the assessment of the effect of molar activity on the pharmacokinetics of radioligands in small animals

AUTHORS: Tatsuya Kikuchi, Toshimitsu Okamura, Ming-Rong Zhang

JOURNAL: EJNMMI radiopharmacy and chemistry

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Background: It is well recognized that the molar activity of a radioligand is an important pharmacokinetic parameter, especially in positron emission tomography (PET) of small animals. Occupation of a significant number of binding sites by radioligand molecules results in low radioligand accumulation in a target region (mass effect). Nevertheless, small-animal PET studies have often been performed without consideration of the molar activity or molar dose of radioligands. A simulation study would therefore help to assess the importance of the mass effect in small-animal PET. Here, we introduce a new compartmental model-based numerical method, which runs on commonly used spreadsheet software, to simulate the effect of molar activity or molar dose on the pharmacokinetics of radioligands.

Results: Assuming a two-tissue compartmental model, time-concentration curves of a radioligand were generated using four simulation methods and the well-known Runge-Kutta numerical method. The values were compared with theoretical values obtained under an ultra-high molar activity condition (pseudo-first-order binding kinetics), a steady-state condition and an equilibrium condition (second-order binding kinetics). For all conditions, the simulation method using the simplest calculation yielded values closest to the theoretical values and comparable with those obtained using the Runge-Kutta method. To satisfy a maximum occupancy less than 5%, simulations showed that a molar activity greater than 150 GBq/μmol is required for a model radioligand when 20 MBq is administered to a 250 g rat and when the concentration of binding sites in target regions is greater than 1.25 nM.

Conclusions: The simulation method used in this study is based on a very simple calculation and runs on widely used spreadsheet software. Therefore, simulation of radioligand pharmacokinetics using this method can be performed on a personal computer and help to assess the importance of the mass effect in small-animal PET. This simulation method also enables the generation of a model time-activity curve for the evaluation of kinetic analysis methods.

TITLE: An Analysis of Isoclonal Antibody Formats Suggests a Role for Measuring PD-L1 with Low Molecular Weight PET Radiotracers

AUTHORS: Junnian Wei, Yung-Hua Wang, Chia Yin Lee, Charles Truillet, David Y Oh, Yichen Xu, Davide Ruggero, Robert R Flavell, Henry F VanBrocklin, Youngho Seo, Charles S Craik, Lawrence Fong, Cheng-I Wang, Michael J Evans

JOURNAL: Molecular imaging and biology

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: The swell of new and diverse radiotracers to predict or monitor tumor response to cancer immunotherapies invites the opportunity for comparative studies to identify optimal platforms. To probe the significance of antibody format on image quality for PD-L1 imaging, we developed and studied the biodistribution of a library of antibodies based on the anti-PD-L1 IgG1 clone C4.

Procedure: A C4 minibody and scFv were cloned, expressed, and characterized. The antibodies were functionalized with desferrioxamine and radiolabeled with Zr-89 to enable a rigorous comparison with prior data collected using89Zr-labeled C4 IgG1. The biodistribution of the radiotracers was evaluated in C57Bl6/J or nu/nu mice bearing B16F10 or H1975 tumors, respectively, which are models that represent high and low tumor autonomous PD-L1 expression.

Results: The tumor uptake of the89Zr-C4 minibody was higher than89Zr-C4 scFv and equivalent to previous data collected using89Zr-C4 IgG1. However, the peak tumors to normal tissue ratios were generally higher for89Zr-C4 scFv compared with89Zr-C4 minibody and89Zr-IgG1. Moreover, an exploratory study showed that the rapid clearance of89Zr-C4 scFv enabled detection of endogenous PD-L1 on a genetically engineered and orthotopic model of hepatocellular carcinoma.

Conclusion: In summary, these data support the use of low molecular weight constructs for PD-L1 imaging, especially for tumor types that manifest in abdominal organs that are obstructed by the clearance of high molecular weight radioligands.

TITLE: Cerebral and myocardial kinetics of [11C]acetoacetate and [11C]β-hydroxybutyrate: A comparative crossover study in healthy rats

AUTHORS: Mette Louise Gram Kjærulff, Thien Vinh Luong, Gabriel Richard, Valérie St-Pierre, Esben Søndergaard, Niels Møller, Lars Christian Gormsen, Sébastien Tremblay, Etienne Croteau, Stephen C Cunnane

JOURNAL: Nuclear medicine and biology

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Background: Ketone metabolism has been studied using positron emission tomography (PET) with the radiotracers [11C]acetoacetate and [11C]β-hydroxybutyrate. However, whether these two radiotracers actually yield equivalent estimates of cerebral and myocardial ketone metabolism has not yet been investigated. This study aimed to investigate and compare the kinetics of both tracers in the brain and heart of healthy rats under varying levels of circulating ketones at baseline and after a single-dose exogenous ketone ester (KE) supplement.

Methods: Six healthy Sprague-Dawley rats each underwent two scans with each tracer: one following oral KE administration and one with a placebo. Cerebral kinetic parameters (Ki, VT, and cerebral metabolic rate (CMR)) were obtained using the Patlak method, whereas myocardial kinetic parameters (K1, k2, and VT) were derived using a 1-tissue compartment model. Parameters were compared through mixed-effects, correlation, and Bland-Altman analyses.

Results: Global CMR increased 3-4-fold in the KE group versus placebo, with strong positive correlations between CMR and plasma ketone levels for both tracers. Correlations between [11C]acetoacetate and [11C]β-hydroxybutyrate were moderate and non-significant for relative cerebral uptake expressed as Ki(ρ = 0.40) and for VT(ρ = 0.38) but strongly positive for absolute uptake, CMR (r = 0.84), with a non-significant mean bias of -0.03. In contrast, myocardial kinetics showed only non-significant weak to moderate correlations between the radiotracers (K1(r = 0.04), k2(r = -0.27), and VT(ρ = 0.43)), with no systematic biases.

Conclusion: [11C]acetoacetate and [11C]β-hydroxybutyrate can be used interchangeably for measuring global CMR in healthy rats but differ in certain cerebral and myocardial kinetics. Whether these findings are generalizable to pathological conditions warrants further studies to explore the kinetics of these tracers in disease models.

JOURNAL: Nuclear medicine communications

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Introduction: This computational study evaluates the accuracy of kinetic models and acquisition schemes in dynamic PET imaging using simulations of 18 F-fallypride PET in the human brain on the real-world data.

Methods: We employed a 2-tissue 4-k model to generate ideal tissue curves for three regions (putamen, thalamus, and temporal cortex) and a reference region (cerebellum), incorporating a simulated metabolite-corrected input function. Realistic measurements were simulated over a 240-min PET scan by defining acquisition protocols (frame timings and durations), modeling tracer decay, and adding noise. Distribution volume ratios (DVRs) were calculated using the Logan reference analysis and the simplified reference tissue model (SRTM), the relative error in DVR was also assessed across various acquisition protocols. Rate constants from the 2-tissue model were varied, and Bland-Altman analysis was quantified to determine bias relative to ground-truth DVR.

Results: Results indicate that, under low noise conditions, the Logan reference method performed optimally with a protocol involving a 60-min dynamic scan, a 60-min break, a 30-min scan, another 60-min break, and a final 30-min scan. In noisier conditions, the SRTM yielded the best results with a 150-min effective scan time incorporating three breaks.

Conclusion: These findings highlight the impact of noise and acquisition strategy on model performance, informing optimal PET imaging protocols.

TITLE: Green conversion of waste PET into magnetic Ni0·4Fe2·6O4/(Fe,Ni)@carbon nanostructure for adsorption and separation of dyes from aqueous media

AUTHORS: Shuhui Wei, Ali Reza Kamali

JOURNAL: Chemosphere

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
A nanostructured core-shell composite (Ni0·4Fe2·6O4/(Fe,Ni)@carbon, NFC) comprising magnetic nano-cores encapsulated with graphitic shells (≈80 wt%) is prepared by facile and clean mechanochemical-molten salt processing approach using waste PET; providing a specific surface area of 201.9 m2g-1, well-developed mesopores, and ferromagnetic behavior characterized by the coercivity value of 149 Oe. NFC is utilized as a high-performance adsorbent for the removal of organic dyes from their aqueous solutions. Moreover, the magnetic performance of NFC enables the facile collection of the exhausted adsorbent out of the purified water. Performances of NFC for the removal of crystal violet dye (CV), methyl orange (MO) and rhodamine B (Rh B) from their aqueous solutions are systematically investigated under different environmental conditions including the adsorbent dosage and dye concentration, as well as the solution pH and temperature, where an impressive CV removal capacity of 201.6-243.8 mg g-1is recorded for a wide pH range of 2-10. Mechanism and kinetics involved in the adsorption process are investigated by studying the adsorption isotherms and thermodynamics. The dye adsorption of the nanocomposite material is confirmed to follow the pseudo-second-order kinetic model combined with the Langmuir isotherm model, exhibiting an excellent spontaneous and exothermic monolayer adsorption capacity of around 153 mg g-1(for MO) for the fresh adsorbent and around 89 mg g-1after three adsorption-regeneration cycles.

TITLE: The Effect of Registration on Voxel-Wise Tofts Model Parameters and Uncertainties from DCE-MRI of Early-Stage Breast Cancer Patients Using 3DSlicer

JOURNAL: Journal of digital imaging

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
We quantitatively investigate the influence of image registration, using open-source software (3DSlicer), on kinetic analysis (Tofts model) of dynamic contrast enhanced MRI of early-stage breast cancer patients. We also show that registration computation time can be reduced by reducing the percent sampling (PS) of voxels used for estimation of the cost function. DCE-MRI breast images were acquired on a 3T-PET/MRI system in 13 patients with early-stage breast cancer who were scanned in a prone radiotherapy position. Images were registered using a BSpline transformation with a 2 cm isotropic grid at 100, 20, 5, 1, and 0.5PS (BRAINSFit in 3DSlicer). Signal enhancement curves were analyzed voxel-by-voxel using the Tofts kinetic model. Comparing unregistered with registered groups, we found a significant change in the 90th percentile of the voxel-wise distribution of Ktrans. We also found a significant reduction in the following: (1) in the standard error (uncertainty) of the parameter value estimation, (2) the number of voxel fits providing unphysical values for the extracellular-extravascular volume fraction (ve> 1), and (3) goodness of fit. We found no significant differences in the median of parameter value distributions (Ktrans, ve) between unregistered and registered images. Differences between parameters and uncertainties obtained using 100PS versus 20PS were small and statistically insignificant. As such, computation time can be reduced by a factor of 2, on average, by using 20PS while not affecting the kinetic fit. The methods outlined here are important for studies including a large number of post-contrast images or number of patient images.

AUTHORS: Liying Zhang, Yonggan Li, Wenxia Wang, Wei Zhang, Qiting Zuo, Amor Abdelkader, Kai Xi, Philippe M Heynderickx, Ki-Hyun Kim

JOURNAL: Environmental research

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Considering the omnipresence of microplastics (MPs) in aquatic environments, they are expected to exert significatn impacts as carriers for diverse waterborne pollutants. In this work, the adsorptive behavior of two ionic components (i.e., sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate (SDBS) and Cr(VI)) has been explored against the two types of MPs as model adsorbents, namely poly (ethylene terephthalate) (PET) and polystyrene (PS). The influence of key variables (e.g., pH, particle size, and dose of the MPs) on their adsorption behavior is evaluated from various respects. The maximum adsorption capacity values of SDBS on PET and PS are estimated to be 4.80 and 4.65 mg⋅g-1, respectively, while those of Cr(VI) ions are significantly lower at 0.080 and 0.072 mg⋅g-1, respectively, The adsorptive equilibrium of SDBS is best described in relation to pH and MP size by a Freundlich isotherm. In contrast, the adsorption behavior of Cr(VI) is best accounted for by a Langmuir isotherm to indicate its adsorption across at least two active surface sites.

TITLE: Micromechanical Modeling of the Biaxial Deformation-Induced Phase Transformation in Polyethylene Terephthalate

AUTHORS: Fateh Enouar Mamache, Amar Mesbah, Hanbing Bian, Fahmi Zaïri

JOURNAL: Polymers

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
In this paper, a micromechanics-based constitutive representation of the deformation-induced phase transformation in polyethylene terephthalate is proposed and verified under biaxial loading paths. The model, formulated within the Eshelby inclusion theory and the micromechanics framework, considers the material system as a two-phase medium, in which the active interactions between the continuous amorphous phase and the discrete newly formed crystalline domains are explicitly considered. The Duvaut-Lions viscoplastic approach is employed in order to introduce the rate-dependency of the yielding behavior. The model parameters are identified from uniaxial data in terms of stress-strain curves and crystallization kinetics at two different strain rates and two different temperatures above glass transition temperature. Then, it is shown that the model predictions are in good agreement with available experimental results under equal biaxial and constant width conditions. The role of the crystallization on the intrinsic properties is emphasized thanks to the model considering the different loading parameters in terms of mechanical path, strain rate and temperature.

TITLE: Synergetic Effects during Co-Pyrolysis of Sheep Manure and Recycled Polyethylene Terephthalate

AUTHORS: Zuhal Akyürek

JOURNAL: Polymers

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Continuous growth in energy demand and plastic waste production are two global emerging issues that require development of clean technologies for energy recovery and solid waste disposal. Co-pyrolysis is an effective thermochemical route for upgrading waste materials to produce energy and value added products. In this study, co-pyrolysis of sheep manure (SM) and recycled polyethylene terephthalate (PET) was studied for the first time in a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) in the temperature range of 25-1000 °C with heating rates of 10-30-50 °C min-1under a nitrogen atmosphere. The synergetic effects of co-pyrolysis of two different waste feedstock were investigated. The kinetic parameters are determined using the Flynn-Wall-Ozawa (FWO) model. The results revealed that the mean values of apparent activation energy for the decomposition of sheep manure into a recycled polyethylene terephthalate blend are determined to be 86.27, 241.53, and 234.51 kJ/mol, respectively. The results of the kinetic study on co-pyrolysis of sheep manure with plastics suggested that co-pyrolysis is a viable technique to produce green energy.

Besides presence of heavy metals, especially arsenic in water bodies, northern India is striving to obliterate crop residue, which is otherwise burnt to make the fields ready for subsequent crop, causing acute air pollution. Through this study, an effort has been made to utilize wheat-straw cellulose to develop inexpensive and efficacious sensing cum annihilation system for deleterious arsenite ions As(III) in water by grafting a novel fluorophore, 3-bromofluoranthene on cellulose (BF@CFs). BF@CFs were characterized for structural, morphological and thermal properties using FTIR, XRD, TGA, FESEM, EDS and TEM, which confirmed the successful insertion of fluoranthene molecule on cellulose while preserving its crystalline nanofibrous structure. Fluorescent studies indicated strong affinity of BF@CFs towards arsenite ions exhibiting "turn on" fluorescence response attributed to inhibition of photo induced electron transfer (PET) and metal ion chelation with a limit of detection of 2.8 ng L-1, lower than WHO prescribed limit of 10 μg L-1. Besides sensing, the porous fibrous network of BF@CFs exhibited good adsorption of As(III) ions with maximum adsorption of 171.2 μg g-1at 35 min under optimized conditions. BF@CFs displayed 95.2% removal efficiency with 2 μg L-1concentration of As (III) ions at room temperature and neutral pH observed by atomic absorption spectrophotometer coupled with hydride generation assembly (HG-AAS) measurements. BF@CFs retained adsorption 97.3% efficiency after five adsorption/ desorption cycles displaying excellent reusability and stability, strengthening its potential as dual functional sensor and adsorbent.

TITLE: Assessing non-invasive quantitative methods for [18F]SynVesT-1 PET imaging of synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A in the rat brain

AUTHORS: Lori Berckmans, Claudia Schrauwen, Alan Miranda, Steven Staelens, Daniele Bertoglio

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A) is a critical biomarker for evaluating synaptic density in neurological research. Among available radioligands, [18F]SynVesT-1 is increasingly used in PET research because of its extended half-life, while having comparable pharmacokinetic properties to the widely used [11C]UCB-J. However, quantitative application in rat models remains unexplored for [18F]SynVesT-1. This study aims to validate quantitative kinetic modelling methods for [18F]SynVesT-1 and develop non-invasive quantification methods for synaptic density in rats.

Methods: First, blood analysis of [18F]SynVesT-1 was performed to generate metabolite-corrected plasma input functions. Then, kinetic modelling was evaluated using compartmental analysis approaches, as well as Logan plot. Furthermore, non-invasive image-derived input functions (IDIF), with and without non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) were compared against the arterial input function (AIF).

Results: Blood analysis showed that the parent fraction of the tracer decreased over time following a sigmoid curve, while the plasma-to-whole blood ratio remained stable over time (0.89 ± 0.02). The two-tissue compartmental model (2TCM) and Logan plot were determined to be the most accurate methods for quantification of [18F]SynVesT-1 kinetics in rats. Additionally, the results demonstrated strong agreement between AIF-derived and image-derived volume of distribution (VT) values, with both image-derived input approaches (IDIF and IDIF-NMF) performing equally well.

Conclusion: These findings validate kinetic modelling methods for [18F]SynVesT-1 PET, enabling their application in further rat studies for preclinical neuroscience research and prove that image-derived input functions are reliable non-invasive alternatives to AIF.

TITLE: Enhancement of Pb(II) adsorption by aged polyethylene terephthalate microplastics in the presence of microalgae: kinetic and mechanistic

AUTHORS: Haicheng Liu, Chenxuan Rao, Huixuan Xu

JOURNAL: Environmental geochemistry and health

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
This study investigated the effects of different aging treatments (UV light, potassium permanganate, and sodium hydroxide treatments) on the adsorption of lead (Pb(II)) by PET microplastics, as well as the impact of Microcystis aeruginosa on lead adsorption by PET microplastics. The results indicated that different aging treatments significantly affected the adsorption capacity of microplastics, which could be attributed to the increased functional groups and surface porosity during the aging process. Kinetic analysis revealed that the adsorption of Pb(II) follows a pseudo-second-order model, suggested that the adsorption process is mainly controlled by chemical adsorption. Intraparticle diffusion analysis further elucidated the migration mechanism of Pb(II) within the microplastics. On the other hand, the presence of Microcystis aeruginosa significantly enhanced the adsorption capacity of microplastics. As the concentration of microalgae increases, the promoting effect of microalgae on Pb(II) adsorption by microplastics gradually strengthens, with extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) secreted by microalgae playing a key role in facilitating Pb(II) adsorption. These findings suggested that microalgae could strengthen the role of microplastics as carriers of heavy metal lead and aggravate the risk of lead pollution diffusion in aquatic ecological environment.

TITLE: Adsorption Performance of Fe-Mn Polymer Nanocomposites for Arsenic Removal: Insights from Kinetic and Isotherm Models

AUTHORS: Jasmina Nikić, Malcolm Watson, Jovana Jokić Govedarica, Maja Vujić, Jovana Pešić, Srđan Rončević, Jasmina Agbaba

JOURNAL: Materials (Basel, Switzerland)

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Global concern over arsenic contamination in drinking water necessitates innovative and sustainable remediation technologies. This study evaluates the adsorption performance of Fe-Mn binary oxide (FMBO) nanocomposites developed by coating polyethylene (PE) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) with FMBO for the removal of As(III) and As(V) from water. Adsorption kinetics were rapid, with equilibrium achieved within 1-4 h depending on the material and pH. PET-FMBO and FMBO exhibited faster rates and higher arsenic removal (up to 96%) than PE-FMBO. Maximum As(III) adsorption capacities ranged from 4.76 to 5.75 mg/g for PE-FMBO, 7.2 to 12.0 mg/g for PET-FMBO, and up to 20.8 mg/g for FMBO, while capacities for As(V) ranged from 5.20 to 5.60 mg/g, 7.63 to 18.4 mg/g, and up to 46.2 mg/g, respectively. The results of the Dubinin-Radushkevich isotherm model, with free energy (Ea) values exceeding 16 kJ/mol, suggest chemisorption is the dominant mechanism, which is supported by the kinetics data. Given the effective removal of As(III), chemisorption likely proceeds through ligand exchange during the Mn oxide-mediated oxidation of As(III) and complexation with hydroxyl groups on the nanocomposite. These findings highlight the strong potential of Fe-Mn polymer nanocomposites, particularly PET-FMBO, for efficient arsenic removal during practical water treatment applications.

AUTHORS: Charly Hélaine, Abdallah Amedlous, Jérôme Toutain, Carole Brunaud, Oleg Lebedev, Charlotte Marie, Cyrille Alliot, Myriam Bernaudin, Ferid Haddad, Svetlana Mintova, Samuel Valable

JOURNAL: Nanoscale

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Nanoparticles have emerged as promising theranostic tools for biomedical applications, notably in the treatment of cancers. However, to fully exploit their potential, a thorough understanding of their biodistribution is imperative. In this context, we prepared radioactive [64Cu]-exchanged faujasite nanosized zeolite ([64Cu]-FAU) to conduct positron emission tomography (PET) imaging tracking in preclinical glioblastoma models.In vivoresults revealed a rapid and gradual accumulation over time of intravenously injected [64Cu]-FAU zeolite nanocrystals within the brain tumor, while no uptake in the healthy brain was observed. Although a specific tumor targeting was observed in the brain, the kinetics of uptake into tumor tissue was found to be dependent on the glioblastoma model. Indeed, our results showed a rapid uptake in U87-MG model while in U251-MG glioblastoma model tumor uptake was gradual over the time. Interestingly, a [64Cu] activity, decreasing over time, was also observed in organs of elimination such as kidney and liver without showing a difference in activity between both glioblastoma models.Ex vivoanalyses confirmed the presence of zeolite nanocrystals in brain tumor with detection of both Si and Al elements originated from them. This radiolabelling strategy, performed for the first time using nanozeolites, enables precise tracking through PET imaging and confirms their accumulation within the glioblastoma. These findings further bolster the potential use of zeolite nanocrystals as valuable theranostic tools.

AUTHORS: Ruiyang Wen, Guoliang Shen, Yang Yu, Jing Zhu, Shijie Xu, Jie Wei, Yue Huo

JOURNAL: Environmental science and pollution research international

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
A new type of titanium phthalate (Ti-PA) catalyst was prepared by exchange method of phthalic acid and isopropyl titanate, which is never been reported before. The Ti-PA catalyst was characterized by FT-IR, TG, Uv-vis, BET, SEM, and EDS. The Ti-PA catalyst shows good catalytic activity in the alcoholysis reaction of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and optimal experimental conditions for the alcoholysis process were optimized by response surface methodology; the Ti-PA catalyst provided a BHET yield of 81.98% for reaction lasting 3.98 h at 191 °C of 0.86% catalyst and 13.7 ml ethylene glycol; the model has good reliability. The kinetics and reaction mechanism of the process were explored and apparent activation energy is 75.52 kJ/mol. Finally, the good catalytic activity of Ti-PA was illustrated by comparing it with currently reported catalysts.

TITLE: Kinetics study of dyeing bicomponent polyester textiles (PET/PTT) using environmentally friendly carriers

AUTHORS: Marwa Souissi, Ramzi Khiari, Mohamed Abdelwaheb, Mounir Zaag, Nizar Meksi, Hatem Dhaouadi

JOURNAL: RSC advances

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
The biobased carrierso-vanillin,p-vanillin, and coumarin, can be used to dye poly(ethylene terephthalate)/poly(trimethylene terephthalate) (PET/PTT) bicomponent filaments at low temperature without affecting their excellent elasticity and elastic recovery. These ecological carriers, which are free from any toxic product, present an effective solution for obtaining an ecological and economical dyeing process. This paper presents a study of the effects of the kinetics when dyeing bicomponent (PET/PTT) filaments with three disperse dyes having different molecular weights at 100 °C (upon adding ecological carriers) and at a high temperature (130 °C). The physicochemical characterization of bicomponent filaments was done using several techniques, such as SEM, BET and DSC, before carrying out a modelling study. Different models (pseudo first-order, pseudo second-order, Elovich, and intra-particle diffusion models) were used to identify an acceptable dyeing mechanism. The dyeing rate constants, the half dyeing times, and the rise time coefficients were then determined and analyzed. The results of this work explain the adsorption mechanism during the dyeing process of bicomponent (PET/PTT) filaments using ecological carriers and provide an experimental foundation for future research.

TITLE: Hydrochars of mixed marine biomass and plastic wastes: Carbonization scenarios and the performance as ketoprofen adsorbents

AUTHORS: Khonekeo Kingkhambang, Kayee Chan, Anatoly Zinchenko

JOURNAL: Waste management (New York, N.Y.)

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
The hydrothermal (HT) conversion of mixed biomass and plastic waste to hydrochar adsorbents has attracted significant attention; however, factors controlling the structure and adsorption properties of hydrochar remain still poorly understood. Herein, HT treatment of the marine biomass waste (crab shells (CR) and fishery waste-derived chitin (CT) and chitosan (CS)) mixed with plastic waste (polyethylene (PE) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET)) at temperatures of 200-250 °C and residence times of 4-12 h was conducted to prepare hydrochars for screening their adsorption characteristics towards ketoprofen, a pharmaceutical pollutant. PET underwent efficient degradation when processed with marine biomass, particularly in mixtures with CS, which facilitated PET depolymerization through an aminolysis reaction. Hydrochars derived from PET mixed with CS demonstrated adsorption capacities for ketoprofen of ca. 25 mg/g due to the presence of the amine, amido, and aromatic groups providing sites for electrostatic interactions, hydrogen bonding, and π-π interactions with ketoprofen. The ketoprofen adsorption was best described by the pseudo-second-order kinetic model and Freundlich-type isotherm. On the other hand, no significant decomposition of PE was observed during the HT treatment of PE and biomass mixtures even in the presence of H2O2oxidizer. However, the hydrochars of CS and CR prepared in the presence of PE exhibited markedly improved ketoprofen adsorption capacity compared to hydrochars of CR and CS. The results of this study demonstrate the benefits of combining plastic and biomass in the waste streams to control waste degradation along with the structure and adsorption properties of the hydrochars.

TITLE: Application of Silver-Loaded Composite Track-Etched Membranes for Photocatalytic Decomposition of Methylene Blue under Visible Light

AUTHORS: Anastassiya A Mashentseva, Murat Barsbay, Nurgulim A Aimanova, Maxim V Zdorovets

JOURNAL: Membranes

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
In this study, the use of composite track-etched membranes (TeMs) based on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and electrolessly deposited silver microtubes (MTs) for the decomposition of toxic phenothiazine cationic dye, methylene blue (MB), under visible light was investigated. The structure and composition of the composite membranes were elucidated by scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction technique. Under visible light irradiation, composite membrane with embedded silver MTs (Ag/PET) displayed high photocatalytic efficiency. The effects of various parameters such as initial dye concentration, temperature, and sample exposure time on the photocatalytic degradation process were studied. The decomposition reaction of MB was found to follow the Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism and a pseudo-first-order kinetic model. The degradation kinetics of MB accelerated with increasing temperature and activation energy,Ea, was calculated to be 20.6 kJ/mol. The reusability of the catalyst was also investigated for 11 consecutive runs without any activation and regeneration procedures. The Ag/PET composite performed at high degradation efficiency of over 68% after 11 consecutive uses.

TITLE: Understanding the interaction between selected microplastics and the toxic dye "Congo red" in water

AUTHORS: Kannan Nadarajah, Yanushiya Jeganathan, Shri Lasha Ramakrishnan, Erick R Bandala

JOURNAL: Chemosphere

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
This study thoroughly investigated the adsorption of Congo Red (CR) dye onto various microplastics (MPs), including high-density polyethylene (HDPE), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), low-density polyethylene (LDPE), polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Initial adsorption capacities (qe) revealed that HDPE had the highest value (21.90 mg/g), followed by PVC (4.2 mg/g), LDPE (3.7 mg/g), PP (3.1 mg/g) and PET (2.8 mg/g). Based on these findings, HDPE and PVC were selected for detailed analysis. Adsorption experiments were conducted under controlled conditions: CR concentration of 100 mg/L, adsorbent dosage of 2 g/L, pH of 5, and temperature of 303 K. Isotherm studies indicated that HDPE followed the Freundlich model (R2- 0.99), while PVC was best described by the Redlich-Peterson model (R2- 0.97). Kinetic analysis showed that HDPE adhered to the Bangham model (reliable ((R2= 0.9267, 0.950, 0.988, and 0.988) R2values obtained for all the concentrations), highlighting pore-filling mechanisms. The conclusion, supported by FTIR analysis, indicates no significant changes in HDPE's functional groups after the adsorption. In contrast, PVC followed a pseudo-second order kinetic model (reliable R2values (0.999, 0.765, 0.956, 0.972) obtained for all the concentrations), suggesting chemisorption, confirmed by FTIR changes in the C-Cl bonds. The optimal pH for adsorption was 5 for HDPE and 4 for PVC. Both processes were exothermic with intraparticle and film diffusion identified as rate-limiting steps. Maximum adsorption capacities (qmax) were 110.1 mg/g for HDPE and 8.1 mg/g for PVC. Desorption experiments were conducted only for HDPE due to PVC's lower adsorption. The highest desorption for HDPE occurred at pH 4 (5.7 mg/L) with an adsorbent dosage of 2 g/L. This study underscores the dual environmental threat posed by MPs, which not only adsorb organic pollutants like CR but also release them under certain conditions. While this research advances our understanding of MPs as pollutant carriers, future work should focus on their desorption behavior in complex, real-world environments. Further studies on other organic pollutants and microplastic types in real wastewater systems are also recommended.

TITLE: Simultaneous adsorption and fluorescent sensing of ampicillin based on a trimetallic metal-organic framework

AUTHORS: Nini Liang, Baoqian Shi, Xuetao Hu, Yongqiang Shi, Tianxing Wang, Xiaowei Huang, Zhihua Li, Xinai Zhang, Xiaobo Zou, Jiyong Shi

JOURNAL: Food chemistry

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Antibiotic residue is a growing concern for human health, and exploring a method for antibiotic detection is imperative Herein, a trimetallic metal-organic framework (NH2-MIL-53(Al)@Mo/Zn-MOF) with an adsorption effect was prepared by growing Mo/Zn-MOF on the surface of NH2-MIL-53(Al) for simultaneous pre-concentration and detection of ampicillin (AMP). The NH2-MIL-53(Al)@Mo/Zn-MOF showed a large specific surface area and stable crystal structure, which is conducive to improving the adsorption efficiency and detection sensitivity. The adsorption process of NH2-MIL-53(Al)@Mo/Zn-MOF to AMP was simulated by a quasi-second-order kinetic model and Langmuir model. Moreover, a ratiometric fluorescent sensor was established based on fluorescence donors of NH2-MIL-53(Al)@Mo/Zn-MOF and CdTe QDs@SiO2and a quencher of mitoxantrone (MIT). With the increasing concentration of AMP, the fluorescence of CdTe QDs@SiO2was gradually quenched by MIT through the inner filter effect (IFE) and photoinduced electron transfer (PET) process. At the same time, that of NH2-MIL-53(Al)@Mo/Zn-MOF was maintained. With this strategy, the sensor achieved an ultra-sensitive detection of AMP with a low detection limit of 0.69 nM. Moreover, the constructed sensor exhibited satisfactory accuracy and reliability for AMP detection in food and environmental samples, which provides a new idea for developing integrated sensors for simultaneous adsorption and detection of antibiotics.

TITLE: SUVs Versus Dynamic Pharmacokinetic [18F]Fluoro-Polyethylene Glycol-Folate Uptake Parameters in Joints of Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients at Baseline and at 4 Weeks of Antitumor Necrosis Factor Therapy

AUTHORS: Wouter Henk-Jan van Binsbergen, Gerben Johannes Cornelis Zwezerijnen, Albert D Windhorst, Patrick Schober, Alexandre E Voskuyl, Conny J van der Laken, Maqsood Yaqub

ABSTRACT:
Quantitative assessment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) activity using [18F]fluoro-polyethylene glycol (PEG)-folate PET/CT scans may prove a useful noninvasive therapeutic response assessment tool to evaluate antitumor necrosis factor therapy in RA patients. This study aims to assess [18F]fluoro-PEG-folate kinetics through a metabolite-corrected plasma input model and to investigate comparisons with simplified quantitative PET outcome measures.Methods:Dynamic [18F]fluoro-PEG-folate PET/CT scans were obtained for 6 patients for a total of 11 scans, 6 before and 5 after treatment. These scans were analyzed using conventional pharmacokinetic models. In addition, SUVs were calculated at intervals of 10-40, 20-50, 30-60, and 40-60 min after injection for comparison and imaging window optimization.Results:[18F]fluoro-PEG-folate kinetics in joints of RA patients were best described using the reversible pharmacokinetic 2-tissue compartment model with a volume of distribution () mean of 1.0 (±0.5).values correlated between arterial and venous samples at both baseline (P< 0.001,r2= 0.96) and 4 wk after antitumor necrosis factor treatment (P< 0.001,r2= 0.75), both at intervals of 30-60 and 40-60 min. Changes inbehavior during treatment could not be accurately assessed because of limited available data, but observed changes in the linear association slope may indicate changed kinetic behavior.Conclusion:The most optimal kinetic model for [18F]fluoro-PEG-folate uptake in joints of RA patients was the reversible 2-tissue compartment model. The associations betweenand a simplified SUV interval of 30-60 min allow us to quantify tracer uptake without the need for a full cross-sectional pharmacokinetic evaluation at the time of imaging. Further research will be required to accurately assess the change in tracer behavior between time points and the use of simplified assessment of changes of tracer uptake in joints over time.

TITLE: Impact of different parametric Patlak imaging approaches and comparison with a 2-tissue compartment pharmacokinetic model with a long axial field-of-view (LAFOV) PET/CT in oncological patients

AUTHORS: Leyun Pan, Christos Sachpekidis, Jessica Hassel, Petros Christopoulos, Antonia Dimitrakopoulou-Strauss

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Aim: The recently introduced Long-Axial-Field-of-View (LAFOV) PET-CT scanners allow for the first-time whole-body dynamic- and parametric imaging. Primary aim of this study was the comparison of direct and indirect Patlak imaging as well as the comparison of different time frames for Patlak calculation with the LAFOV PET-CT in oncological patients. Secondary aims of the study were lesion detectability and comparison of Patlak analysis with a two-tissue-compartment model (2TCM).

Methodology: 50 oncological patients with 346 tumor lesions were enrolled in the study. All patients underwent [18F]FDG PET/CT (skull to upper thigh). Here, the Image-Derived-Input-Function) (IDIF) from the descending aorta was used as the exclusive input function. Four sets of images have been reviewed visually and evaluated quantitatively using the target-to-background (TBR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR): short-time (30 min)-direct (STD) Patlak Ki, short-time (30 min)-indirect (STI) Patlak Ki, long-time (59.25 min)-indirect (LTI) Patlak Ki, and 50-60 min SUV (sumSUV). VOI-based 2TCM was used for the evaluation of tumor lesions and normal tissues and compared with the results of Patlak model.

Results: No significant differences were observed between the four approaches regarding the number of tumor lesions. However, we found three discordant results: a true positive liver lesion in all Patlak Kiimages, a false positive liver lesion delineated only in LTI Kiwhich was a hemangioma according to MRI and a true negative example in a patient with an atelectasis next to a lung tumor. STD, STI and LTI Kiimages had superior TBR in comparison with sumSUV images (2.9-, 3.3- and 4.3-fold higher respectively). TBR of LTI Kiwere significantly higher than STD Ki. VOI-based k3showed a 21-fold higher TBR than sumSUV. Parameters of different models vary in their differential capability between tumor lesions and normal tissue like Patlak Kiwhich was better in normal lung and 2TCM k3which was better in normal liver. 2TCM Kirevealed the highest correlation (r = 0.95) with the LTI Patlak Kiin tumor lesions group and demonstrated the highest correlation with the STD Patlak Kiin all tissues group and normal tissues group (r = 0.93 and r = 0.74 respectively).

Conclusions: Dynamic [18F]-FDG with the new LAFOV PET/CT scanner produces Patlak Kiimages with better lesion contrast than SUV images, but does not increase the lesion detection rate. The time window used for Patlak imaging plays a more important role than the direct or indirect method. A combination of different models, like Patlak and 2TCM may be helpful in parametric imaging to obtain the best TBR in the whole body in future.

TITLE: Defective iron-based metal-organic framework derived from discarded plastics for rapid and efficient adsorptive removal of methylmercury

AUTHORS: Yitong Chen, Zhouheng Xia, Xiaojing Zhou, Na Ma, Wei Dai

JOURNAL: Environmental science and pollution research international

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Metal-organic framework (MOF) has gained widespread attention as potential adsorbents for the removal of methylmercury (CH3Hg+). This study synthesizes a defective MIL-88A(Fe) (D-MIL-88A(Fe)) from waste polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Structural characterization via XRD, SEM, N2adsorption-desorption, and FT-IR confirmed the crystalline MIL-88A(Fe) framework with hierarchical porosity (0.6 nm micropores and 1.95 nm mesopores) and retained carboxyl/Fe-O functional groups, enhancing mass transfer and adsorption accessibility. Adsorption equilibrium studies revealed 93.4% CH3Hg+removal with a maximum adsorption capacity of 4.91 mg/g (Langmuir model), indicating monolayer adsorption dominated by physical interactions. Kinetic analysis demonstrated ultrafast removal (90% within 500 min, k1= 0.0076 min-1), aligning with pseudo-first-order kinetics. The material exhibited robust regeneration, retaining > 90% efficiency after five cycles. By utilizing discarded PET as a low-cost ligand source, this work not only reduces MOF production costs but also offers a dual solution for CH3Hg⁺-contaminated wastewater remediation and plastic waste value assessment.

TITLE: Microporous carbon derived from waste plastics for efficient adsorption of tetracycline: Adsorption mechanism and application potentials

AUTHORS: Shiyu Bian, Zhuoyu Cai, Weinan Xing, Chunyu Zhao, Yuwei Pan, Jiangang Han, Guangyu Wu, Yudong Huang

JOURNAL: Environmental research

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
In recent years, the accumulation of waste plastics and emergence plastic-derived pollutants such as microplastics have driven significantly the development and updating of waste plastic utilization technology. This study prepared the porous carbon (PC-1-KOH) material directly from polyethylene terephthalate (PET) in waste plastic bottles using KOH activation and molten salt strategy for efficient removal of antibiotic tetracycline (TC). The maximum removal efficiency of TC was 100.0% with a PC-1-KOH weight of 20 mg. In addition, the TC removal efficiency stayed over 80.0% within the rage of pH of 3-9 and different water bodies. The adsorption process was described by the Pseudo-second-order kinetic model and the Langmuir isotherm, suggesting that the adsorption of TC was predominantly chemical in nature and occurred on a homogeneous surface. The pores filling, hydrogen bonding, π-π stacking interactions and electrostatic interaction are the main mechanisms of TC adsorption. This work demonstrates a sustainable approach to converting plastic waste derived materials into functional materials for effective pollution removal and environmental remediation.

TITLE: Cryoconcentration and 3D Temperature Profiles During Freezing of mAb Solutions in Large-Scale PET Bottles and a Novel Scale-Down Device

AUTHORS: Oliver Bluemel, Jakob W Buecheler, Miguel A Rodrigues, Vitor Geraldes, Georg Hoelzl, Karoline Bechtold-Peters, Wolfgang Friess

JOURNAL: Pharmaceutical research

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Small-scale models that simulate large-scale freezing of bulk drug substance of biopharmaceuticals are highly needed to define freezing and formulation parameters based on process understanding. We evaluated a novel scale-down device (SDD), which is based on a specially designed insulation cover, with respect to changes in concentration after freezing, referred to as cryoconcentration, and 3D temperature profiles. Furthermore, the effect of the initial monoclonal antibody (mAb) concentration on cryoconcentration was addressed.

Methods: 2 L and 125 mL bottles were utilized. Temperatures were mapped using type T thermocouples. Frozen blocks were cut and mAb and histidine concentrations were analysed by HPLC. In addition, concentration- and temperature-dependent viscosities were measured.

Results: 3D freezing profiles in the SDD were comparable to large-scale bottles. The SDD accurately predicted cryoconcentration of both mAb and histidine of large-scale freezing. Concentric changes in concentration were evident as well as an unforeseen diluted core at the last point to freeze. At low initial mAb concentration cryoconcentration was substantial, while high initial mAb concentration suppressed cryoconcentration almost completely.

Conclusion: The novel SDD gives detailed insights into large-scale freezing of mAb solutions using only a fraction of the simulated volume. It is a promising material- and cost-saving tool to understand large-scale freezing processes.

TITLE: Amendment of Sargassum oligocystum bio-char with MnFe2O4 and lanthanum MOF obtained from PET waste for fluoride removal: A comparative study

AUTHORS: Rauf Foroutan, Reza Mohammadi, Jafar Razeghi, Mehrshad Ahmadi, Bahman Ramavandi

JOURNAL: Environmental research

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
The use of biomass and waste to produce adsorbent reduces the cost of water treatment. The bio-char of Sargassum oligocystum (BCSO) was modified with MnFe2O4magnetic particles and La-metal organic framework (MOF) to generate an efficient adsorbent (BCSO/MnFe2O4@La-MOF) for fluoride ions (F-) removal from aqueous solutions. The performance of BCSO/MnFe2O4@La-MOF was compared with BCSO/MnFe2O4and BCSO. The characteristics of the adsorbents were investigated using various techniques, which revealed that the magnetic composites were well-synthesized and exhibited superparamagnetic properties. The maximum adsorption efficiencies (BCSO: 97.84%, BCSO/MnFe2O4: 97.85%, and BCSO/MnFe2O4@La-MOF: 99.36%) were achieved under specific conditions of pH 4, F-concentration of 10 mg/L, and adsorbent dosage of 3, 1.5, and 1 g/L for BCSO, BCSO/MnFe2O4, and BCSO/MnFe2O4@La-MOF, respectively. The results demonstrated that the experimental data adheres to a pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The enthalpy, entropy, and Gibbs free energy were determined to be negative; thus, the F-adsorption was exothermic and spontaneous in the range of 25-50 °C. The equilibrium data of the process exhibited conformity with the Langmuir model. The maximum adsorption capacities of F-ions were determined as 10.267 mg/g for BCSO, 14.903 mg/g for the BCSO/MnFe2O4, and 31.948 mg/g for BCSO/MnFe2O4@La-MOF. The KFand ATvalues for the F-adsorption were obtained at 21.03 mg/g (L/mg)1/nand 100 × 10+9L/g, indicating the pronounced affinity of the BCSO/MnFe2O4@La-MOF towards F-than other samples. The significant potential of the BCSO/MnFe2O4@La-MOF magnetic composite for F-removal from industrial wastewater, makes it suitable for repeated utilization in the adsorption process.

TITLE: Utilizing Monocarboxylate Transporter 1-Mediated Blood-Brain Barrier Penetration for Glioblastoma Positron Emission Tomography Imaging with 6-[18F]Fluoronicotinic Acid

ABSTRACT:
Glioblastoma is the most malignant brain tumor in adults, and its prognosis remains dismal. The blood-brain barrier impedes the effectiveness of many drugs, which are otherwise effective for cancer treatment. Monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1) is expressed on endothelial and glioblastoma cells. Our approach aims to leverage MCT1 to transport theranostic agents across the blood-brain barrier. In this context, we present herein the application of fluorine-18-labeled nicotinic acid (denoted as [18F]FNA) for glioblastoma imaging using positron emission tomography (PET). An intracranial mouse model of human glioblastoma was prepared by using patient-derived BT12 cells. PET imaging, ex vivo biodistribution, brain tissue autoradiography, and tumor and tissue uptake kinetic analyses were performed. Additionally, the ligand-target interaction was studied using in silico modeling. The xenografted glioblastomas were distinctly visualized in all 18 mice with a mean standardized uptake value of 0.92 ± 0.11 and tumor-to-brain ratio of 1.66 ± 0.17. The tumor uptake of intravenously administered [18F]FNA decreased by 76% on average when MCT1 was inhibited, whereas preadministration of 60 mg/kg niacin significantly enhanced [18F]FNA tumor uptake. The G protein-coupled receptor GPR109A is a high-affinity receptor for niacin (nicotinic acid). In silico simulations indicated that both niacin and fluorinated nicotinic acid (FNA) interact with the GPR109A receptor in a similar manner. In the presence of a GPR109A inhibitor in in vivo experiments, the tumor residence of [18F]FNA was extended. [18F]FNA has demonstrated its potential for PET imaging in a clinically relevant orthotopic glioblastoma model, and MCT1 plays a crucial role in [18F]FNA transport. The results pave the way for the development of niacin-derived theranostics for glioblastoma care.

TITLE: Influence of different food matrices on the abundance, characterization, migration kinetics and hazards of microplastics released from plastic packaging (PP and PET)

AUTHORS: Qingrun Liu, Jingkai Fang, Zitian Liu, Yulun Chen, Qiwen Chen, Zhe Chen, Shaofeng Yuan, Hang Yu, Weirong Yao

JOURNAL: Food chemistry

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
The effect of food matrix on the release of microplastics from plastic packaging was investigated by treating plastic samples with various food simulants. MPs were released during simulated conditions, and their main source was the separation of plastic samples subjected to ageing. Acidic high oil simulants resulted in the greatest abundance of MPs (1311.33 ± 262.22 and 1414.00 ± 214.52 items/piece). Dual constant kinetic model and Elovich kinetic model described the process well (R2> 0.9019), indicating the release rate of MPs was mainly controlled by characteristics of plastics and environment. Characterization showed the morphology of plastics became rougher, carbonyl index increased, crystalline shapes changed and proportion of O increased. The release mechanism was deduced to be deterioration of the plastic by oxidative reactions. Finally, hazard assessment methodologies were developed, the results showed these MPs are hazardous to humans. It is hoped that this study will draw more attention to the harmful effects of MPs.

TITLE: Development and in vitro evaluation of new bifunctional 89Zr-chelators based on the 6-amino-1,4-diazepane scaffold for immuno-PET applications

AUTHORS: Benedikt Klasen, Daniel Lemcke, Thomas L Mindt, Gilles Gasser, Frank Rösch

JOURNAL: Nuclear medicine and biology

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Introduction: Combination of hydroxamate bearing side chains with the 6-amino-1,4-diazepane scaffold provides a promising strategy for fast and stable89Zr-labeling of antibodies. Following this approach, we hereby present the development, labeling kinetics and in vitro complex stability of three resulting bifunctional chelator derivatives both stand-alone and coupled to a model protein in comparison to different linear deferoxamine (DFO) derivatives.

Methods: The novel89Zr-chelator Hy3ADA5was prepared via amide-coupling of separately synthesized 6-amino-1,4-diazepane-6-pentanoic acid and hydroxamate-containing side chains. Two further bifunctional derivatives were synthesized by extending the resulting system with either a squaramide- or p-isothiocyanatophenyl moiety for simplified binding to proteins. After coupling to a model antibody and purification, the resulting immunoconjugates as well as the unbound chelator derivatives were89Zr-labeled at room temperature (RT) and neutral pH. For comparison, different DFO derivatives were analogously coupled, purified and radiolabeled. In vitro complex stability of the resulting radioconjugates was investigated in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and human serum at 37 °C over a period of 7 days.

Results: 89Zr-labeling of the novel unbound Hy3ADA5derivatives indicated rapid complexation kinetics resulting in high radiochemical conversions (RCC) of 84-94% after 90 min. Similar or even faster radiolabeling with slightly increased maximum yields was obtained using the DFO-analogues. Initially, [89Zr]Zr-DFO*-p-Ph-NCS showed a delayed formation, nevertheless reaching almost quantitative complexation. Radiolabeling of the corresponding immunoconjugates Hy3ADA5-SA-mAb and Hy3ADA5-p-Ph-NCS-mAb resulted in 82.0 ± 1.1 and 89.2 ± 0.7% RCC, respectively after 90 min representing high but slightly lower labeling efficiency compared to the DFO- and DFO*-functionalized analogues. All examined radioimmunoconjugates showed very high in vitro complex stability both in human serum and PBS, providing no significant release of the radiometal. In the case of unbound chelators, however, the p-Ph-NCS-functionalized derivatives indicated considerable instability in human serum already after 1 h.

Conclusion: The novel chelator derivatives based on hydroxamate-functionalized 6-amino-1,4-diazepane revealed fast and high yielding89Zr-labeling kinetics as well as high in vitro complex stability both stand-alone and coupled to an antibody. Therefore, Hy3ADA5represents a promising tool for radiolabeling of biomolecules such as antibodies at mild conditions for immuno-PET applications.

TITLE: Is froth flotation a potential scheme for microplastics removal? Analysis on flotation kinetics and surface characteristics

AUTHORS: Yingshuang Zhang, Hongru Jiang, Kai Bian, Hui Wang, Chongqing Wang

JOURNAL: The Science of the total environment

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Increasing microplastics (MPs) cause significant threats to the ecosystem and society. The tremendous advances concerning the sources, occurrence, chemical behavior, toxicology, and ecological effects contribute to the emerging MPs removal. Based on the intrinsic hydrophobicity of MPs, froth flotation can remove MPs from water environments via bubble attachment on hydrophobic surfaces. This study comprehensively investigated plastic, aqueous, and operating variables in the flotation removal of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polystyrene (PS) MPs, assisted by numerous bench-scale experiments and a first-order model with rectangular distribution of floatability. Froth flotation performed better to remove MPs with higher density, larger size, and lower concentration. K+(0-50 mM), Na+(0-150 mM), and Ca2+(0-10 mM) did not affect the flotation recovery of MPs. MPs particles could be thoroughly removed by froth flotation when humic acid (HA) and Al3+concentrations were less than 30 mg/L and 0.05 mM, respectively. 100% of MPs could be removed at a rapid flotation rate under aeration volume of 5.4 mL/min and frother dosage of 28 mg/L. Non-covalent interactions and near-surface water film might favor the adhesion of hydrophilic species and obstruct the flotation removal of MPs. The froth flotation-based MPs removal had potential application in multiple flow systems due to its simplicity and continuity.

TITLE: Development and evaluation of a bayesian optimization FDG population-based input function for implementing parametric imaging in the clinical practice

AUTHORS: Alessia Artesani, Lorenzo Leonardi, Jelena Jandric, Lorenzo Muraglia, Charalampos Tsoumpas, Marcello Rodari, Laura Evangelista

JOURNAL: Biomedical physics & engineering express

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Aim.Parametric imaging from dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) has gained interest for tumour diagnostics and treatment response evaluation. However, the lack of a standardized method for generating theinput function-reference curve for kinetic modelling-has led to inconsistent descriptors, contributing to uncertainties in parametric imaging reliability. This study aims to address this challenge by proposing a hyperparametric optimization method for deriving FDG population-based input function (PBIF), independent of acquisition and injection protocols.Method. This study included ten patients undergoing FDG PET scans using a standard axial field of view scanner. Image-derived input functions (IDIF) were extracted from the descending aorta, normalized, and utilized as input for PBIF modelling. Bayesian hyperparameter optimization was employed to estimate global optima for ten parameters that describe the input function through independent runs of up to 600 iterations each. The injection profile was integrated as a double rectangular profile, representing both the tracer injection and the saline flush tracer residual.Results. The Bayesian optimization successfully modelled patient-specific IDIFs (R2= 0.97). The algorithm estimated injection and flush durations in agreement with recorded values. Parameter distributions showed low variability, with median amplitude and time constant values varying by around 15%. The glucose-affine molecule dynamics were characterized by distinct time constants of 6 s, 4 min, and 70 min. Analytical and numerical comparisons of parametric imaging from IDIF and PBIF show that Patlak analysis is unaffected by the injection characteristics.Conclusion. The study highlights the benefits of Bayesian optimization for modelling PBIF without prior knowledge of injection characteristics. These findings support the existence of unified FDG PBIF, facilitating the utilization of parametric imaging across PET centres. Although the present study is based on a limited, single-centre cohort, this methodological development is intended as a foundational study to further multi-centre validation on larger population.

TITLE: Autoradiography of Intracerebral Tumours in the Chick Embryo Model: A Feasibility Study Using Different PET Tracers

AUTHORS: Sandra Krause, Alexandru Florea, Chang-Hoon Choi, Wieland A Worthoff, Alexander Heinzel, Saskia Fischer, Nicole Burda, Bernd Neumaier, N Jon Shah, Philipp Lohmann, Felix M Mottaghy, Karl-Josef Langen, Carina Stegmayr

JOURNAL: Molecular imaging and biology

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: In addition to rodent models, the chick embryo model has gained attention for radiotracer evaluation. Previous studies have investigated tumours on the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM), but its value for radiotracer imaging of intracerebral tumours has yet to be demonstrated.

Procedures: Human U87 glioblastoma cells and U87-IDH1 mutant glioma cells were implanted into the brains of chick embryos at developmental day 5. After 12-14 days of tumour growth, blood-brain-barrier integrity was evaluated in vivo using MRI contrast enhancement or ex vivo with Evans blue dye. The tracers O-(2-[18F]fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine ([18F]FET) (n = 5), 3,4-dihydroxy-6-[18F]-fluoro-L-phenylalanine ([18F]FDOPA) (n = 3), or [68Ga] labelled quinoline-based small molecule fibroblast activation protein inhibitor ([68Ga]FAPI-46) (n = 4) were injected intravenously if solid tumours were detected with MRI. For time-activity curves for [18F]FET, additional micro PET (µPET) was performed. The chick embryos were sacrificed 60 min post-injection, and cryosections of the tumour-bearing brains were produced and evaluated with autoradiography and immunohistochemistry.

Results: Intracerebral tumours were produced with a 100% success rate in viable chick embryos at the experimental endpoint. However, 52% of chick embryos (n = 85) did not survive the procedure to embryonic development day 20. For the evaluated radiotracers, the tumour-to-brain ratios (TBR) derived from ex vivo autoradiography, as well as the tracer kinetics derived from µPET for intracerebral chick embryo tumours, were comparable to those previously reported in rodents and patients: the TBRmean for [18F]FET was 1.69 ± 0.54 (n = 5), and 3.8 for one hypermetabolic tumour and < 2.0 for two isometabolic tumors using [18F]FDOPA, with a TBRmean of 1.92 ± 1,11 (n = 3). The TBRmean of [68Ga]FAPI-46 for intracerebral chick embryo tumours was 19.13 ± 0.64 (n = 4). An intact blood-tumour barrier was observed in one U87-MG tumour (n = 5).

Conclusions: Radiotracer imaging of intracerebral tumours in the chick embryo offers a fast model for the evaluation of radiotracer uptake, accumulation, and kinetics. Our results indicate a high comparability between intracerebral tumour imaging in chick embryos and xenograft rodent models or brain tumour patients.

TITLE: Determination of the Thermodynamic Parameters of the Pyrolysis Process of Post-Consumption Thermoplastics by Non-Isothermal Thermogravimetric Analysis

AUTHORS: Paul Palmay, Cesar Puente, Diego Barzallo, Joan Carles Bruno

JOURNAL: Polymers

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Currently, the pyrolysis process is an important technology for the final treatment of plastic waste worldwide. For this reason, knowing in detail the chemical process and the thermodynamics that accompany cracking reactions is of utmost importance. The present study aims to determine the thermodynamic parameters of the degradation process of conventional thermoplastics (polystyrene (PS), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), high-density polyethylene (HDPE), polypropylene (PP) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC)) from the study of their chemical kinetics by thermogravimetric analysis (TG). Non-isothermal thermogravimetry was performed at three heating rates from room temperature to 550 °C with an inert nitrogen atmosphere with a flow of 20 mL min-1. Once the TG data is obtained, an analysis is carried out with the isoconversional models of Friedman (FR), Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose (KAS), and Flynn-Wall-Ozawa (FWO) in order to determine the one that best fits the experimental data, and with this, the calculation of the activation energy and the pre-exponential factor is performed. The validation of the model was carried out using the correlation factor, determining that the KAS model is the one that best adjusts for the post-consumer thermoplastic degradation process at the three heating rates. With the use of the kinetic parameters, the variation of the Gibbs free energy is determined in each of the cases, where it is necessary that for structures containing aromatic groups a lower energy is presented, which implies a relative ease of degradation compared to the linear structures.

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: This study aimed to evaluate a novel technique for cell tracking by visualising the activity of the human sodium/iodide symporter (hNIS) after transplantation of hNIS-expressing multilayered cell sheets in a rat model of chronic myocardial infarction.

Methods: Triple-layered cell sheets were generated from mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from mice overexpressing hNIS (hNIS-Tg). Myocardial infarction was induced by permanent ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery in F344 athymic rats, and a triple-layered MEFs sheets were transplanted to the infarcted area two weeks after surgery. To validate the temporal tracking and kinetic analysis of the transplanted MEFs sheets, sequential cardiac single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) examinations with a99mTcO4-injection were performed. The cell sheets generated using MEFs of wild-type mice (WT) served as controls.

Results: A significantly higher amount of99mTcO4-was taken into the hNIS-Tg MEFs than into WT MEFs (146.1 ± 30.9-fold). The obvious accumulation of99mTcO4-was observed in agreement with the region where hNIS-Tg MEFs were transplanted, and these radioactivities peaked 40-60 min after99mTcO4-administration. The volume of distribution of the hNIS-Tg MEF sheets declined gradually after transplantation, implying cellular malfunction and a loss in the number of transplanted cells.

Conclusion: The reporter gene imaging with hNIS enables the serial tracking and quantitative kinetic analysis of cell sheets transplanted to infarcted hearts.

JOURNAL: Food chemistry

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
In this study, polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofiber membranes with a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) support and dual-layer PAN structure were modified into ion exchange membranes through carboxylation and subsequent sulfonation, yielding AEA-COOH-AMS membranes with both weak and strong acidic functional groups. These membranes were thoroughly characterized in terms of structure, morphology, and adsorption performance. Lysozyme adsorption experiments using purified solutions demonstrated a high binding capacity of 629.16 mg/g at 318 K, with thermodynamic analysis confirming spontaneous and endothermic adsorption. Kinetic studies identified the Avrami model as the best fit, with increasing adsorption rates at higher temperatures. Moreover, complete lysozyme desorption using 0.4 mol/L NaCl validated the membrane's regeneration potential. This study evaluated membrane performance using pure lysozyme solutions under controlled conditions, establishing a foundation for future application in protein separation from complex food matrices. The AEA-COOH-AMS nanofiber membrane system demonstrates strong potential as a reusable platform for selective protein adsorption, with promising prospects for integration into food biotechnology and bioproduct recovery processes.

JOURNAL: Journal of virology

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Specific-pathogen-free (SPF) mice are widely used in biomedical research to model human infections. However, these animals do not always accurately recapitulate human immune responses. This is due, in part, to their lack of infection history. A growing number of studies show that the host microbiome influences the development, progression, and responses of many diseases. To date, the majority of research on the microbiome has focused on the bacterial populations and less on the eukaryotic virome of the host. Here, we characterize a transmission model where SPF mice are exposed to natural mouse pathogens at physiologic doses and routes. We found that pet store mice acquired from different sources have distinct viromes and infection histories. We also found significant heterogeneity in the kinetics of the transmission of natural mouse viruses. A common virus found in our model was murine Kobuvirus. Surprisingly, murine Kobuvirus infection was found in the glandular stomach epithelia and not intestinal epithelia like other enteric picornaviruses. Together, these data characterize the heterogeneity of the dirty mouse cohousing system and provide a foundation for studying the biology of natural mouse viruses.

Importance: Increasing evidence supports microbial exposure as a critical factor in shaping responses to immune challenges such as infections and vaccinations. However, many experimental models introducing microbial exposure into laboratory animals have confounding factors that may impact phenotypes and are not well characterized. Here, we characterized the pet store reservoir virome diversity, prior infection history, and transmission kinetics. We found significant heterogeneity across these features of the pet store cohousing model. Moreover, we leveraged this model to investigate the tropism of two less characterized viruses-murine Kobuvirus and murine astrovirus 2-in a natural transmission setting. These findings highlight the importance of characterizing the virome of pet store reservoirs to better mimic microbial exposure in humans.

TITLE: Evolution of characteristic components from retired wind turbine blades in multiple thermal atmospheres: thermal decomposition characterization and kinetic behavior

AUTHORS: Haoyun Liu, Pei Li, Yonggang Zhou, Jinsong Zhou, Jianzhong Shi, Bing Hong

JOURNAL: Journal of environmental management

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
The lack of adequate data and in-depth insights into the thermal decomposition kinetics of retired wind turbine blades (RFTBs) critically impede its thermal recycling and upgrade. This study explores the non-isothermal pyrolysis of RFTBs under inert N2atmosphere and reactive air and CO2atmospheres at heating rates of 10-30 K/min. The PET component (C1) and full RFTBs component (C3) exhibited two pyrolysis stages (Py1 and Py2) in N2, whereas the glass fiber reinforced polymer (C2) revealed only one pyrolysis stage. Higher heating rates shifted peaks of heat weight loss rate upward due to thermal hysteresis. Under air and CO2atmospheres, all feedstocks developed an additional gasification stage (Gs, >400 °C), originating from products undergoing partial oxidation reactions in air and interactions in CO2. Both pathways release heat that accelerates pyrolysis through localized thermal enhancement, effectively reducing heat transfer limitations via short-distance energy redistribution. Apparent activation energies for C3 obtained via Model-free fitting method were 148.43/181.34 kJ/mol (Py1/Py2, N2), 151.07/151.57/136.62 kJ/mol (Py1/Py2/Gs, air), and 67.76/87.79/78.85 kJ/mol (Py1/Py2/Gs, CO2), demonstrating that autothermal pyrolysis in air and CO2gasification are more active and energy-saving than traditional pyrolysis in N2. Model-fitting method revealed optimal mechanisms involving random nucleation and nuclei growth (An, n = 4 for Py1, n = 2/3 for Py2 and Gs), accurately describing CO2gasification of full RFTBs component, and these were validated through kinetic compensation effect analysis. This study provides accurate and critical guidance for the design, optimization and scale-up of RFTBs pyrolysis procedures and reactors.

TITLE: Enhanced performance of adsorptive removal of dibenzothiophene from model fuel over copper(II)-alginate beads containing polyethyleneterephthalate derived activated carbon

AUTHORS: Maryam Fayazi, Masoud Ghanei-Motlagh

JOURNAL: Journal of colloid and interface science

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
In this research, copper(II)-alginate (Cu(II)-A) beads containing polyethyleneterephthalate derived activated carbon (PET-AC) with porous structure were prepared by a feasible cross-linking technology. The composition and structure of the beads were thoroughly analyzed by X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller adsorption, scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray methods. The desulfurization activity of the adsorbent for dibenzothiophene (DBT) in the model oil was investigated. The influence of mass ratio of PET-AC on the features of the prepared Cu(II)-A beads was studied. According to experimental results, higher adsorption capacity was acquired from PET-AC/Cu(II)-A at 4:1 mass ratio due to its high porosity and available Cu(II) adsorption centers. The adsorption isotherms could be correlated by the Langmuir isotherm and the maximum adsorption capacity reached up to 62.9 mg g-1. The adsorption data showed better fitting (R2greater than 0.99) to the pseudo-second-order rate equation. Lewis acid-base and π-π interactions might be the driving force of the DBT adsorption. The adsorbent could be also reused for 4 successive runs with negligible loss in desulfurization capability. All of these features make the PET-AC/Cu(II)-A as a potential adsorbent towards desulfurization from fuels.

AUTHORS: Richard-Joseph L Peterson, Elanna P Neppel, Daniel Holmes, P Anh Trinh, Robert Y Ofoli, John R Dorgan

JOURNAL: ChemSusChem

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Chemical upcycling of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) through ammonolysis is pursued. Model studies are conducted on bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate reacting with ammonia in the presence of excess ethylene glycol (EG) to form terephthalamide. Reactions conducted over the range of temperatures from 50 to 125 °C yield pre-exponential factors of A1= 758 ± 120 L mol-1h-1/A2= 1033 ± 220 L mol-1h-1and activation energies of Ea1= 22.1 ± 1.5 kJ mol-1and Ea2= 26.5 ± 2.1 kJ mol-1. Diffusional limitations are explored using particle sizes in the ranges of 1800-2500 μm, 250-600 μm, and 150-250 μm. Data from the particle size experiments is combined with the rate constants determined from the model studies to construct an effectiveness factor. Diffusivity is used as a fitting parameter, resulting in an estimated value of 1.37 ± 0.48 E-7 cm2s-1for ammonia in PET at 100 °C, which compares well to related literature values. Diffusional limitations are of profound importance; for particles of only 1 millimeter in average thickness, the conversion rate is decreased by a factor of ten! The comprehensive understanding of the ammonolysis of PET in EG provided can play an important role in improving material reuse and fostering a more circular economy.

ABSTRACT:
Adsorption of heavy metals from degraded of Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) products by strong cation exchange resin AmberliteIR-120 under optimized conditions toward the selectivity removal of metals are in the following order: Al3+> Zn2+> Mg2+> Fe2+> Ni2+. Therefore, kinetic and adsorption isotherm models were applied for fitting experimental data. Comparatively, adsorption isotherm study revealed that Langmuir isotherm model better fits adsorption on surface of resin over than the Freundlich model. In summary, AmberliteIR-120 strong acid cation exchange resin can be used as an efficient adsorbent for heavy metals removal from depolymerized products bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate.

TITLE: Effect of 3D-Printed Honeycomb Core on Compressive Property of Hybrid Energy Absorbers: Experimental Testing and Optimization Analysis

AUTHORS: Rita de Cássia Silva, Gabriel Martins de Castro, Alessandro Borges de Sousa Oliveira, Augusto César de Mendonça Brasil

JOURNAL: Materials (Basel, Switzerland)

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
This paper presents an innovative method of constructing energy absorbers, whose primary function is to effectively transform kinetic energy into strain energy in events with high deformation rates. Hybrid specimens are proposed considering thin-walled windowed metallic tubes filled with 3D-printed hexagonal honeycombs made of PET-G and ABS thermoplastic. The patterned windows dimensions vary from 20 × 20, 20 × 30, 15 × 20 and 15 × 30 mm2. Although using polymers in engineering and thin-walled sections is not new, their combination has not been explored in this type of structure designed to withstand impacts. Specimens resist out-of-plane quasi-static axial loading, and test results are analyzed, demonstrating that polymer core gives the samples better performance parameters than unfilled samples regarding energy absorption (), load rate (LR), and structural effectiveness (η). An optimization procedure using specialized software was applied to evaluate experimental results, which led to identifying the optimal window geometry (16.4 × 20 mm2, in case) and polymer to be used (ABS). The optimized sample was constructed and tested for axial compression to validate the optimization outcomes. The results reveal that the optimal sample performed similarly to the estimated parameters, making this geometry the best choice under the test conditions.

ABSTRACT:
Introduction: The peripheral autonomic nervous system may be involved years before onset of motor symptoms in some patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Specific imaging techniques to quantify the cholinergic nervous system in peripheral organs are an unmet need. We tested the hypothesis that patients with PD display decreased [18F]FEOBV uptake in peripheral organs - a sign of parasympathetic denervation.

Methods: We included 15 PD patients and 15 age- and sex matched healthy controls for a 70 min whole-body dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) acquisition. Compartmental modelling was used for tracer kinetic analyses of adrenal gland, pancreas, myocardium, spleen, renal cortex, muscle and colon. Standard uptake values (SUV) at 60-70 min post injection were also extracted for these organs. Additionally, SUVs were also determined in the total colon, prostate, parotid and submandibular glands.

Results: We found no statistically significant difference of [18F]FEOBV binding parameters in any organs between patients with PD and healthy controls, although trends were observed. The pancreas SUV showed a 14% reduction in patients (P = 0.021, not statistically significant after multiple comparison correction). We observed a trend towards lower SUVs in the pancreas, colon, adrenal gland, and myocardium of PD patients with versus without probable REM sleep behavior disorder.

Conclusion: [18F]FEOBV PET may not be a sensitive marker for parasympathetic degeneration in patients with PD.

ABSTRACT:
The extremely high levels of water pollution caused by various industrial activities represent one of the most important environmental problems. Efficient techniques and advanced materials have been extensively developed for the removal of highly toxic organic pollutants, including pesticides. This study investigated the photocatalytic degradation of the fungicide carbendazim (Czm) using composite track-etched membranes (TeMs) in an aqueous solution. Copper(I) oxide (Cu2O) and zinc oxide (ZnO) microtubes (MTs) were prepared using an electroless template deposition technique in porous poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) TeMs with nanochannels with a density of 4 × 107pores/cm-2and diameter of 385 ± 9 nm to yield Cu2O@PET and ZnO@PET composite membranes, respectively. A mixed Cu2O/ZnO@PET composite was prepared via a two-step deposition process, containing ZnO (87%) and CuZ (13%) as crystalline phases. The structure and composition of all composite membranes were elucidated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques. Under UV-visible light irradiation, the Cu2O/ZnO@PET composite displayed enhanced photocatalytic activity, reaching 98% Czm degradation, higher than Cu2O@PET and ZnO@PET composites. The maximum Czm degradation efficiency from aqueous solution was obtained at an optimal pH of 6 and contact time of 140 min. The effects of various parameters such as temperature, catalyst dosage and sample exposure time on the photocatalytic degradation process were studied. The degradation reaction of Czm was found to follow the Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism and a pseudo-first order kinetic model. The degradation kinetics of Czm accelerated with increasing temperature, and the activation energy (Ea) levels were calculated as 11.9 kJ/mol, 14.22 kJ/mol and 15.82 kJ/mol for Cu2O/ZnO@PET, ZnO@PET and Cu2O@PET composite membranes, respectively. The reusability of the Cu2O/ZnO@PET catalyst was also investigated at different temperatures for 10 consecutive runs, without any activation or regeneration processes. The Cu2O/ZnO@PET composite exhibited degradation efficiency levels of over 50% at 14 °C and over 30% at 52 °C after 5 consecutive uses.

TITLE: Quantification of brain oxygen extraction and metabolism with [15O]-gas PET: A technical review in the era of PET/MRI

AUTHORS: Audrey P Fan, Hongyu An, Farshad Moradi, Jarrett Rosenberg, Yosuke Ishii, Tadashi Nariai, Hidehiko Okazawa, Greg Zaharchuk

JOURNAL: NeuroImage

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) and the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) are key cerebral physiological parameters to identify at-risk cerebrovascular patients and understand brain health and function. PET imaging with [15O]-oxygen tracers, either through continuous or bolus inhalation, provides non-invasive assessment of OEF and CMRO2. Numerous tracer delivery, PET acquisition, and kinetic modeling approaches have been adopted to map brain oxygenation. The purpose of this technical review is to critically evaluate different methods for [15O]-gas PET and its impact on the accuracy and reproducibility of OEF and CMRO2measurements. We perform a meta-analysis of brain oxygenation PET studies in healthy volunteers and compare between continuous and bolus inhalation techniques. We also describe OEF metrics that have been used to detect hemodynamic impairment in cerebrovascular disease. For these patients, advanced techniques to accelerate the PET scans and potential synthesis with MRI to avoid arterial blood sampling would facilitate broader use of [15O]-oxygen PET for brain physiological assessment.

TITLE: Biodistribution and dosimetry in human healthy volunteers of the PET radioligands [11C]CHDI-00485180-R and [11C]CHDI-00485626, designed for quantification of cerebral aggregated mutant huntingtin

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Huntington's disease is caused by a trinucleotide expansion in the HTT gene, which leads to aggregation of mutant huntingtin (mHTT) protein in the brain and neurotoxicity. Direct in vivo measurement of mHTT aggregates in human brain parenchyma is not yet possible. In this first-in-human study, we investigated biodistribution and dosimetry in healthy volunteers of [11C]CHDI-00485180-R ([11C]CHDI-180R) and [11C]CHDI-00485626 ([11C]CHDI-626), two tracers designed for PET imaging of aggregated mHTT in the brain that have been validated in preclinical models.

Methods: Biodistribution and radiation dosimetry studies were performed in 3 healthy volunteers (age 25.7 ± 0.5 years; 2 F) for [11C]CHDI-180R and in 3 healthy volunteers (age 35.3 ± 6.8 years; 2 F) for [11C]CHDI-626 using sequential whole-body PET-CT. Source organs were delineated in 3D using combined PET and CT data. Individual organ doses and effective doses were determined using OLINDA 2.1.

Results: There were no clinically relevant adverse events. The mean effective dose (ED) for [11C]CHDI-180R was 4.58 ± 0.65 μSv/MBq, with highest absorbed doses for liver (16.9 μGy/MBq), heart wall (15.9 μGy/MBq) and small intestine (15.8 μGy/MBq). Mean ED for [11C]CHDI-626 was 5.09 ± 0.06 μSv/MBq with the highest absorbed doses for the gallbladder (26.5 μGy/MBq), small intestine (20.4 μGy/MBq) and liver (19.6 μGy/MBq). Decay-corrected brain uptake curves showed promising kinetics for [11C]CHDI-180R, but for [11C]CHDI-626 an increasing signal over time was found, probably due to accumulation of a brain-penetrant metabolite.

Conclusion: [11C]CHDI-180R and [11C]CHDI-626 are safe for in vivo PET imaging in humans. The estimated radiation burden is in line with most11C-ligands. While [11C]CHDI-180R has promising kinetic properties in the brain, [11C]CHDI-626 is not suitable for human in vivo mHTT PET due to the possibility of a radiometabolite accumulating in brain parenchyma.

TITLE: Whole-Body Multiparametric PET in Clinical Oncology: Current Status, Challenges, and Opportunities

JOURNAL: AJR. American journal of roentgenology

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
The interpretation of clinical oncologic PET studies has historically used static reconstructions based on SUVs. SUVs and SUV-based images have important limitations, including dependence on uptake times and reduced conspicuity of tracer-avid lesions in organs with high background uptake. The acquisition of dynamic PET images enables additional PET reconstructions via Patlak modeling, which assumes that a tracer is irreversibly trapped by tissues of interest. The resulting multiparametric PET images capture a tracer's net trapping rate and apparent volume of distribution, separating the contributions of bound and free tracer fractions to the PET signal captured in the SUV. Potential benefits of multiparametric PET include higher quantitative stability, superior lesion conspicuity, and greater accuracy for differentiating malignant and benign lesions. However, the imaging protocols necessary for multiparametric PET are inherently more complex and time intensive, despite the recent introduction of automated or semiautomated scanner-based reconstruction packages. In this Review, we examine the current state of multiparametric PET in whole-body oncologic imaging. We summarize the Patlak method and relevant tracer kinetics, discuss clinical workflows and protocol considerations, and highlight clinical challenges and opportunities. We aim to help oncologic imagers make informed decisions about whether to implement multiparametric PET in their clinical practices.

TITLE: Kinetic analysis of dominant intraprostatic lesion of prostate cancer using quantitative dynamic [18F]DCFPyL-PET: comparison to [18F]fluorocholine-PET

AUTHORS: Dae-Myoung Yang, Fiona Li, Glenn Bauman, Joseph Chin, Stephen Pautler, Madeleine Moussa, Irina Rachinsky, John Valliant, Ting-Yim Lee

JOURNAL: EJNMMI research

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Identification of the dominant intraprostatic lesion(s) (DILs) can facilitate diagnosis and treatment by targeting biologically significant intra-prostatic foci. A PSMA ligand, [18F]DCFPyL (2-(3-{1-carboxy-5-[(6-[18F]fluoro-pyridine-3-carbonyl)-amino]-pentyl}-ureido)-pentanedioic acid), is better than choline-based [18F]FCH (fluorocholine) in detecting and localizing DIL because of higher tumour contrast, particularly when imaging is delayed to 1 h post-injection. The goal of this study was to investigate whether the different imaging performance of [18F]FCH and [18F]DCFPyL can be explained by their kinetic behaviour in prostate cancer (PCa) and to evaluate whether DIL can be accurately detected and localized using a short duration dynamic positron emission tomography (PET).

Methods: 19 and 23 PCa patients were evaluated with dynamic [18F]DCFPyL and [18F]FCH PET, respectively. The dynamic imaging protocol with each tracer had a total imaging time of 22 min and consisted of multiple frames with acquisition times from 10 to 180 s. Tumour and benign tissue regions identified by sextant biopsy were compared using standardized uptake value (SUV) and tracer kinetic parameters from kinetic analysis of time-activity curves.

Results: For [18F]DCFPyL, logistic regression identified Kiand k4as the optimal model to discriminate tumour from benign tissue (84.2% sensitivity and 94.7% specificity), while only SUV was predictive for [18F]FCH (82.6% sensitivity and 87.0% specificity). The higher k3(binding) of [18F]FCH than [18F]DCFPyL explains why [18F]FCH SUV can differentiate tumour from benign tissue within minutes of injection. Superior [18F]DCFPyL tumour contrast was due to the higher k4/k3(more rapid washout) in benign tissue compared to tumour tissue.

Conclusions: DIL was detected with good sensitivity and specificity using 22-min dynamic [18F]DCFPyL PET and avoids the need for delayed post-injection imaging timepoints. The dissimilar in vivo kinetic behaviour of [18F]DCFPyL and [18F]FCH could explain their different SUV images. Clinical Trial RegistrationNCT04009174(ClinicalTrials.gov).

TITLE: Insights into molecular mechanism of plasticizer biodegradation in Dietzia kunjamensis IITR165 and Brucella intermedia IITR166 isolated from a solid waste dumpsite

AUTHORS: Saurabh Singh, Ravindra Singh Thakur, Natesan Manickam

JOURNAL: Journal of applied microbiology

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Aims: Isolation of phthalate esters (PAEs) degrading bacteria from a solid waste dumpsite could degrade many plasticizers efficiently and to investigate their degrading kinetics, pathways, and genes.

Methods and results: Based on their 16S rRNA gene sequence the strains were identified as Dietzia kunjamensis IITR165 and Brucella intermedia IITR166, which showed a first-order degradation kinetic model under lab conditions. The quantification of phthalates and their intermediate metabolites identification were done by using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) and gas chromatography-tandem mass-spectrometry (GC-MS/MS), respectively. Both the bacteria utilized >99% dibutyl phthalate at a high concentration of 100-400 mg L-1 within 192 h as monitored by UHPLC. GC-MS/MS revealed the presence of metabolites dimethyl phthalate (DMP), phthalic acid (PA), and benzoic acid (BA) during DBP degradation by IITR165 while monobutyl phthalate (MBP) and PA were identified in IITR166. Phthalate esters degrading gene cluster in IITR165 comprised two novel genes coding for carboxylesterase (dkca1) and mono-alkyl phthalate hydrolase (maph), having only 37.47% and 47.74% homology, respectively, with reported phthalate degradation genes, along with the terephthalate dioxygenase system (tphA1, A2, A3, and B). However, IITR166 harbored different gene clusters comprising di-alkyl phthalate hydrolase (dph_bi), and phthalate dioxygenase (ophA, B, and C) genes.

Conclusions: Two novel bacterial strains, Dietzia kunjamensis IITR165 and Brucella intermedia IITR166, were isolated and found to efficiently degrade DBP at high concentrations. The degradation followed first-order kinetics, and both strains exhibited a removal efficiency of over 99%. Metabolite analysis revealed that both bacteria utilized de-methylation, de-esterification, and decarboxylation steps during degradation.

TITLE: Accuracy and precision of zero-echo-time, single- and multi-atlas attenuation correction for dynamic [11C]PE2I PET-MR brain imaging

ABSTRACT:
Background: A valid photon attenuation correction (AC) method is instrumental for obtaining quantitatively correct PET images. Integrated PET/MR systems provide no direct information on attenuation, and novel methods for MR-based AC (MRAC) are still under investigation. Evaluations of various AC methods have mainly focused on static brain PET acquisitions. In this study, we determined the validity of three MRAC methods in a dynamic PET/MR study of the brain.

Methods: Nine participants underwent dynamic brain PET/MR scanning using the dopamine transporter radioligand [11C]PE2I. Three MRAC methods were evaluated: single-atlas (Atlas), multi-atlas (MaxProb) and zero-echo-time (ZTE). The68Ge-transmission data from a previous stand-alone PET scan was used as reference method. Parametric relative delivery (R1) images and binding potential (BPND) maps were generated using cerebellar grey matter as reference region. Evaluation was based on bias in MRAC maps, accuracy and precision of [11C]PE2I BPNDand R1estimates, and [11C]PE2I time-activity curves. BPNDwas examined for striatal regions and R1in clusters of regions across the brain.

Results: For BPND, ZTE-MRAC showed the highest accuracy (bias < 2%) in striatal regions. Atlas-MRAC exhibited a significant bias in caudate nucleus (- 12%) while MaxProb-MRAC revealed a substantial, non-significant bias in the putamen (9%). R1estimates had a marginal bias for all MRAC methods (- 1.0-3.2%). MaxProb-MRAC showed the largest intersubject variability for both R1and BPND. Standardized uptake values (SUV) of striatal regions displayed the strongest average bias for ZTE-MRAC (~ 10%), although constant over time and with the smallest intersubject variability. Atlas-MRAC had highest variation in bias over time (+10 to - 10%), followed by MaxProb-MRAC (+5 to - 5%), but MaxProb showed the lowest mean bias. For the cerebellum, MaxProb-MRAC showed the highest variability while bias was constant over time for Atlas- and ZTE-MRAC.

Conclusions: Both Maxprob- and ZTE-MRAC performed better than Atlas-MRAC when using a68Ge transmission scan as reference method. Overall, ZTE-MRAC showed the highest precision and accuracy in outcome parameters of dynamic [11C]PE2I PET analysis with use of kinetic modelling.

ABSTRACT:
The P-glycoprotein (P-gp/ABCB1) is a major efflux transporter which impedes the brain delivery of many drugs across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Focused ultrasound with microbubbles (FUS) enables BBB disruption, which immediate and delayed impact on P-gp function remains unclear. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging using the radiolabeled substrate [11C]metoclopramide provides a sensitive and translational method to study P-gp function at the living BBB. A FUS protocol was devised in rats to induce a substantial and targeted disruption of the BBB in the left hemisphere. BBB disruption was confirmed by the Evan's Blue extravasation test or the minimally-invasive contrast-enhanced MRI. The expression of P-gp was measured 24 h or 48 h after FUS using immunostaining and fluorescence microscopy. The brain kinetics of [11C]metoclopramide was studied by PET at baseline, and both immediately or 24 h after FUS, with or without half-maximum P-gp inhibition (tariquidar 1 mg/kg). In each condition (n = 4-5 rats per group), brain exposure of [11C]metoclopramide was estimated as the area-under-the-curve (AUC) in regions corresponding to the sonicated volume in the left hemisphere, and the contralateral volume. Kinetic modeling was performed to estimate the uptake clearance ratio (R1) of [11C]metoclopramide in the sonicated volume relative to the contralateral volume. In the absence of FUS, half-maximum P-gp inhibition increased brain exposure (+135.0 ± 12.9%, p < 0.05) but did not impact R1(p > 0.05). Immediately after FUS, BBB integrity was selectively disrupted in the left hemisphere without any detectable impact on the brain kinetics of [11C]metoclopramide compared with the baseline group (p > 0.05) or the contralateral volume (p > 0.05). 24 h after FUS, BBB integrity was fully restored while P-gp expression was maximally down-regulated (-45.0 ± 4.5%, p < 0.001) in the sonicated volume. This neither impacted AUC nor R1in the FUS + 24 h group (p > 0.05). Only when P-gp was inhibited with tariquidar were the brain exposure (+130 ± 70%) and R1(+29.1 ± 15.4%) significantly increased in the FUS + 24 h/tariquidar group, relative to the baseline group (p < 0.001). We conclude that the brain kinetics of [11C]metoclopramide specifically depends on P-gp function rather than BBB integrity. Delayed FUS-induced down-regulation of P-gp function can be detected. Our results suggest that almost complete down-regulation is required to substantially enhance the brain delivery of P-gp substrates.

JOURNAL: Frontiers in medicine

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Introduction: The 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO) receives growing interest as a biomarker in glioblastoma. Mouse models can serve as an important tool for the investigation of biomarkers in glioblastoma, but several glioblastoma models indicated only low TSPO-PET signals in contrast to high TSPO-PET signals of human glioblastoma. Thus, we aimed to investigate TSPO-PET imaging in the syngeneic immunocompetent SB28 mouse model, which is thought to closely represent the tumor microenvironment (TME) of human glioblastoma.

Methods: Dynamic TSPO-PET/CT imaging was performed for 60 min after injection of 13.6 ± 4.2 MBq [18F]GE-180. Contrast enhanced CT (ceCT) was acquired prior to PET and served for assessment of tumor volumes and attenuation correction. SB28 and sham mice were imaged at an early (week-1;n= 6 SB28,n= 6 sham) and a late time-point (week-3;n= 8 SB28,n= 9 sham) after inoculation. Standard of truthex vivotumor volumes were obtained for SB28 mice at the late time-point. Tracer kinetics were analyzed for the lesion site and the carotid arteries to establish an image derived input function (IDIF). TSPO-PET and ceCT lesion volumes were compared withex vivovolumes by calculation of root-mean-square-errors (RMSE). Volumes of distribution (VTmax/mean) in the lesion were calculated using carotid IDIF and standardized uptake values (SUVmax/mean) were obtained for a 40-60 min time frame.

Results: Higher uptake rate constants (K1) were observed for week-1 SB28 tumor lesions when compared to week-3 SB28 tumor lesions. Highest agreement between TSPO-PET lesion volumes andex vivotumor volumes was achieved with a 50% maximum threshold (RMSE-VT: 39.7%; RMSE-SUV: 34.4%), similar to the agreement of ceCT tumor volumes (RMSE: 30.1%). Lesions of SB28 mice had higher PET signal when compared to sham mice at week-1 (VTmax 6.6 ± 2.9 vs. 3.9 ± 0.8,p= 0.035; SUVmax 2.3 ± 0.5 vs. 1.2 ± 0.1,p< 0.001) and PET signals remained at a similar level at week-3 (VTmax 5.0 ± 1.6 vs. 2.7 ± 0.8,p= 0.029; SUVmax 1.9 ± 0.5 vs. 1.2 ± 0.2,p= 0.0012). VTmax correlated with SUVmax (R2= 0.532,p< 0.001).

Conclusion: TSPO-PET imaging of immunocompetent SB28 mice facilitates early detection of tumor signals over sham lesions. SB28 tumors mirror high TSPO-PET signals of human glioblastoma and could serve as a valuable translational model to study TSPO as an imaging biomarker.

JOURNAL: Journal of cerebral blood flow and metabolism : official journal of the International Society of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
For some positron emission tomography studies, radiotracer is administered as bolus plus continuous infusion (B/I) to achieve a state of equilibrium. This approach can reduce scanning time and simplify data analysis; however, the method must be validated and optimized for each tracer. This study aimed to validate a B/I method forin vivoquantification of synaptic density using radiotracers which target the synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2 A: [11C]UCB-J and [18F]SynVesT-1. Observed mean standardized uptake values (SUV) in target tissue relative to that in plasma (CT/CP) or a reference tissue (SUVR-1) were calculated for 30-minute intervals across 120 or 150-minute dynamic scans and compared against one-tissue compartment (1TC) model estimates of volume of distribution (VT) and binding potential (BPND), respectively. We were unable to reliably achieve a state of equilibrium with [11C]UCB-J, and all 30-minute windows yielded overly large bias and/or variability forCT/CPand SUVR-1. With [18F]SynVesT-1, a 30-minute scan 90-120 minutes post-injection yieldedCT/CPand SUVR-1 values that estimated their respective kinetic parameter with sufficient accuracy and precision (within 7±6%) . This B/I approach allows a clinically feasible scan at equilibrium with potentially better accuracy than a static scan SUVR following a bolus injection.

TITLE: Enhancing intersection safety in autonomous traffic: A grid-based approach with risk quantification

AUTHORS: Wei Wu, Siyu Chen, Mengfei Xiong, Lu Xing

JOURNAL: Accident; analysis and prevention

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Existing studies on autonomous intersection management (AIM) primarily focus on traffic efficiency, often overlooking the overall intersection safety, where conflict separation is simplified and traffic conflicts are inadequately assessed. In this paper, we introduce a calculation method for the grid-based Post Encroachment Time (PET) and the total kinetic energy change before and after collisions. The improved grid-based PET metric provides a more accurate estimation of collision probability, and the total kinetic energy change serves as a precise measure of collision severity. Consequently, we establish the Grid-Based Conflict Index (GBCI) to systematically quantify collision risks between vehicles at an autonomous intersection. Then, we propose a traffic-safety-based AIM model aimed at minimizing the weighted sum of total delay and conflict risk at the intersection. This entails the optimization of entry time and trajectory for each vehicle within the intersection, achieving traffic control that prioritizes overall intersection safety. Our results demonstrate that GBCI effectively assesses conflict risks within the intersection, and the proposed AIM model significantly reduces conflict risks between vehicles and enhances traffic safety while ensuring intersection efficiency.

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Background: The synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2 A (SV2A) has been identified as a biomarker of interest for neurological pathology. The SV2A specific radiotracer [18F]SynVesT-1 has shown good binding characteristics in mouse and human. The aim of this study was to characterize the binding parameters of [18F]SynVesT-1 in the rat brain and investigate simplified quantification methods. Twenty-one Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scans were conducted in male Sprague-Dawley rats with a bolus injection of [18F]SynVesT-1. Varying concentrations of non-radioactive SynVesT-1 were injected in an increasing mass dose paradigm (n = 21 ) with radioactivity in arterial blood recorded throughout. The radiometabolism was characterized in a further group (n = 7). The total volume of distribution (VT) was estimated using compartmental modelling and Logan plot and then compared to the standardized uptake value at 30-60 min (SUV30 - 60). Occupancy plots and a Lassen plot were generated.

Results: The pharmacokinetics of [18F]SynVesT-1 PET showed rapid brain uptake and increasing doses of SynVesT-1 revealed a robust reduction in radiotracer uptake over all brain regions. The two-tissue compartmental model was most appropriate and the estimated VTwas highly correlated with Logan VT, as was the SUV30 - 60. The VNDwas estimated to be 3.75, which is 12.5% (pons) to 22% (thalamus) of the VT. The estimated upper mass limit required to achieve 5% target occupancy is 0.48 µg/kg.

Conclusion: [18F]SynVesT-1 shows good characteristics for imaging the rat brain, however care must be taken to achieve adequate molar activity to avoid mass dose affects (< 5% occupancy). Data showed no suitable reference region for [18F]SynVesT-1, however SUV30 - 60does give an appropriate surrogate for VT.

Clinical trial number: Not applicable.

ABSTRACT:
Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) is one of the main synthetic plastics produced worldwide. The extensive use of this polymer causes several problems due to its low degradability. In this scenario, biocatalysts dawn as an alternative to enhance PET recycling. The enzymatic hydrolysis of PET results in a mixture of terephthalic acid (TPA), ethylene glycol (EG), mono-(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (MHET) and bis-(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET) as main products. This work developed a new methodology to quantify the hydrolytic activity of biocatalysts, using BHET as a model substrate. The protocol can be used in screening enzymes for PET depolymerization reactions, amongst other applications. The very good fitting (R2= 0.993) between experimental data and the mathematical model confirmed the feasibility of the Michaelis-Menten equation to analyze the effect of BHET concentration (8-200 mmol L-1) on initial hydrolysis rate catalyzed by Humicola insolens cutinase (HiC). In addition to evaluating the effects of enzyme and substrate concentration on the enzymatic hydrolysis of BHET, a novel and straightforward method for MHET synthesis was developed using an enzyme load of 0.025 gproteingBHET-1and BHET concentration of 60 mmol L-1at 40 °C. MHET was synthesized with high selectivity (97 %) and yield (82 %). The synthesized MHET properties were studied using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetry (TGA), and proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR), observing the high purity of the final product (86.7 %). As MHET is not available commercially, this synthesis using substrate and enzyme from open suppliers adds new perspectives to monitoring PET hydrolysis reactions.

ABSTRACT:
Conventional whole-body18F-FDG PET imaging provides a semi-quantitative evaluation of overall glucose metabolism without gaining insight into the specific transport and metabolic steps. Here we demonstrate the ability of total-body multiparametric18F-FDG PET to quantitatively evaluate glucose metabolism using macroparametric quantification and assess specific glucose delivery and phosphorylation processes using microparametric quantification for studying recovery from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Methods: The study included thirteen healthy subjects and twelve recovering COVID-19 subjects within eight weeks of confirmed diagnosis. Each subject had a dynamic18F-FDG scan on the uEXPLORER total-body PET/CT system for one hour. Semiquantitative standardized uptake value (SUV) and SUV ratio relative to blood (SUVR) were calculated for regions of interest (ROIs) in different organs to measure glucose utilization. Tracer kinetic modeling was performed to quantify microparametric rate constantsK1andk3that characterize18F-FDG blood-to-tissue delivery and intracellular phosphorylation, respectively, and a macroparameterKithat represents18F-FDG net influx rate. Statistical tests were performed to examine differences between the healthy controls and recovering COVID-19 subjects. Impact of COVID-19 vaccination was investigated. We further generated parametric images to confirm the ROI-based analysis.

Results: We detected no significant difference in lung SUV but significantly higher lung SUVR andKiin the recovering COVID-19 subjects, indicating an improved sensitivity of kinetic quantification for detecting the difference in glucose metabolism. A significant difference was also observed in the lungs with the phosphorylation ratek3, but not with the delivery rateK1, which suggests it is glucose phosphorylation, not glucose delivery, that drives the observed difference of glucose metabolism in the lungs. Meanwhile, there was no or little difference in bone marrow metabolism measured with SUV, SUVR andKi, but a significant increase in bone-marrow18F-FDG delivery rateK1in the COVID-19 group (p< 0.05), revealing a difference of glucose delivery in this immune-related organ. The observed differences were lower or similar in vaccinated COVID-19 subjects as compared to unvaccinated ones. The organ ROI-based findings were further supported by parametric images.

Conclusions: Higher lung glucose metabolism and bone-marrow glucose delivery were observed with total-body multiparametric18F-FDG PET in recovering COVID-19 subjects as compared to healthy subjects, which suggests continued inflammation due to COVID-19 during the early stages of recovery. Total-body multiparametric PET of18F-FDG delivery and metabolism can provide a more sensitive tool and more insights than conventional static whole-body18F-FDG imaging to evaluate metabolic changes in systemic diseases such as COVID-19.

TITLE: [18F]2-Fluoro-2-deoxy-sorbitol PET Imaging for Quantitative Monitoring of Enhanced Blood-Brain Barrier Permeability Induced by Focused Ultrasound

AUTHORS: Gaëlle Hugon, Sébastien Goutal, Ambre Dauba, Louise Breuil, Benoit Larrat, Alexandra Winkeler, Anthony Novell, Nicolas Tournier

JOURNAL: Pharmaceutics

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Focused ultrasound in combination with microbubbles (FUS) provides an effective means to locally enhance the delivery of therapeutics to the brain. Translational and quantitative imaging techniques are needed to noninvasively monitor and optimize the impact of FUS on blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability in vivo. Positron-emission tomography (PET) imaging using [18F]2-fluoro-2-deoxy-sorbitol ([18F]FDS) was evaluated as a small-molecule (paracellular) marker of blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity. [18F]FDS was straightforwardly produced from chemical reduction of commercial [18F]2-deoxy-2-fluoro-D-glucose. [18F]FDS and the invasive BBB integrity marker Evan's blue (EB) were i.v. injected in mice after an optimized FUS protocol designed to generate controlled hemispheric BBB disruption. Quantitative determination of the impact of FUS on the BBB permeability was determined using kinetic modeling. A 2.2 ± 0.5-fold higher PET signal (n= 5;p< 0.01) was obtained in the sonicated hemisphere and colocalized with EB staining observed post mortem. FUS significantly increased the blood-to-brain distribution of [18F]FDS by 2.4 ± 0.8-fold (VT;p< 0.01). Low variability (=10.1%) ofVTvalues in the sonicated hemisphere suggests reproducibility of the estimation of BBB permeability and FUS method. [18F]FDS PET provides a readily available, sensitive and reproducible marker of BBB permeability to noninvasively monitor the extent of BBB disruption induced by FUS in vivo.

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: The aim of this study was to validate simplified methods for quantifying [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-46 uptake against full pharmacokinetic modeling.

Methods: Ten patients with pancreatobiliary cancer underwent a 90-min dynamic PET/CT scan using a long axial field of view system. Arterial blood samples were used to establish calibrated plasma-input function from both continuous arterial sampling and image-derived input function (IDIF). Lesional [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-46 kinetics were described using conventional non-linear plasma-input tissue-compartment models. Logan plots using 30-90 min and 30-60 min post-injection (p.i), image-based target-to-whole blood ratio (TBR), mean standardized uptake values (SUVmean) normalized to body weight, lean body mass, and body surface area, at 20-30 min, 60-70 min and 80-90 min p.i were assessed.

Results: One patient was excluded due to discontinued scan acquisition and missing arterial sampling. Thirteen tumoral lesions and 11 non-tumoral lesions were included. A reversible 2-tissue-compartment model showed most preferrable fits for all types of [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-46 positive lesions. The distribution volume (VT) results obtained using arterial sampling plasma-input function and those using plasma-IDIF (VT_plasma_IDIF) showed an excellent correlation (Spearman rank correlation coefficient (rs) = 0.949). Logan VTusing both time intervals were highly correlated with VT_plasma_IDIF(rs≥ 0.938). The correlation values with VT_plasma_IDIFfor image-based TBR and SUVmean parameters were higher at 80-90 min (rs≥ 0.839) and at 60-70 min (rs≥ 0.835) p.i than at 20-30 min p.i (rs≤ 0.774).

Conclusion: Image-based TBR and SUVmean at 60-70 min p.i are suitable for quantifying [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-46 uptake.

TITLE: Validation of quantitative [18F]NaF PET uptake parameters in bone diseases: a systematic review

AUTHORS: Ruben D de Ruiter, Jolien Zwama, Pieter G H M Raijmakers, Maqsood Yaqub, George L Burchell, Ronald Boellaard, Adriaan A Lammertsma, Elisabeth M W Eekhoff

JOURNAL: Annals of nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: [18F]NaF PET has become an increasingly important tool in clinical practice toward understanding and evaluating diseases and conditions in which bone metabolism is disrupted. Full kinetic analysis using nonlinear regression (NLR) with a two-tissue compartment model to determine the net rate of influx (Ki) of [18F]NaF is considered the gold standard for quantification of [18F]NaF uptake. However, dynamic scanning often is impractical in a clinical setting, leading to the development of simplified semi-quantitative parameters. This systematic review investigated which uptake parameters have been used to evaluate bone disorders and how they have been validated to measure disease activity.

Methods: A literature search (in PubMed, Embase.com, and Clarivate Analytics/Web of Science Core Collection) was performed up to 28th November 2023, in collaboration with an information specialist. Each database was searched for relevant literature regarding the use of [18F]NAF PET/CT to measure disease activity in bone-related disorders. The main aim was to explore whether the reported semi-quantitative uptake values were validated against full kinetic analysis. A second aim was to investigate whether the chosen uptake parameter correlated with a disease-specific outcome or marker, validating its use as a clinical outcome or disease marker.

Results: The initial search included 1636 articles leading to 92 studies spanning 29 different bone-related conditions in which [18F]NaF PET was used to quantify [18F]NaF uptake. In 12 bone-related disorders, kinetic analysis was performed and compared with simplified uptake parameters. SUVmean(standardized uptake value) and SUVmaxwere used most frequently, though normalization of these values varied greatly between studies. In some disorders, various studies were performed evaluating [18F]NaF uptake as a marker of bone metabolism, but unfortunately, not all studies used this same approach, making it difficult to compare results between those studies.

Conclusion: When using [18F]NaF PET to evaluate disease activity or treatment response in various bone-related disorders, it is essential to detail scanning protocols and analytical procedures. The most accurate outcome parameter can only be obtained through kinetic analysis and is better suited for research. Simplified uptake parameters are better suited for routine clinical practice and repeated measurements.

TITLE: Quantitative assessment of myelin density using [11C]MeDAS PET in patients with multiple sclerosis: a first-in-human study

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease characterized by inflammatory demyelinated lesions. New treatment strategies are being developed to stimulate myelin repair. Quantitative myelin imaging could facilitate these developments. This first-in-man study aimed to evaluate [11C]MeDAS as a PET tracer for myelin imaging in humans.

Methods: Six healthy controls and 11 MS patients underwent MRI and dynamic [11C]MeDAS PET scanning with arterial sampling. Lesion detection and classification were performed on MRI. [11C]MeDAS time-activity curves of brain regions and MS lesions were fitted with various compartment models for the identification of the best model to describe [11C]MeDAS kinetics. Several simplified methods were compared to the optimal compartment model.

Results: Visual analysis of the fits of [11C]MeDAS time-activity curves showed no preference for irreversible (2T3k) or reversible (2T4k) two-tissue compartment model. Both volume of distribution and binding potential estimates showed a high degree of variability. As this was not the case for 2T3k-derived net influx rate (Ki), the 2T3k model was selected as the model of choice. Simplified methods, such as SUV and MLAIR2 correlated well with 2T3k-derived Ki, but SUV showed subject-dependent bias when compared to 2T3k. Both the 2T3k model and the simplified methods were able to differentiate not only between gray and white matter, but also between lesions with different myelin densities.

Conclusion: [11C]MeDAS PET can be used for quantification of myelin density in MS patients and is able to distinguish differences in myelin density within MS lesions. The 2T3k model is the optimal compartment model and MLAIR2 is the best simplified method for quantification.

TITLE: Exploring the nigrostriatal and digestive interplays in Parkinson's disease using dynamic total-body [11C]CFT PET/CT

AUTHORS: Mei Xin, Yihan Wang, Xinlan Yang, Lianghua Li, Cheng Wang, Yue Gu, Chenpeng Zhang, Gang Huang, Yun Zhou, Jianjun Liu

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Dynamic total-body imaging enables new perspectives to investigate the potential relationship between the central and peripheral regions. Employing uEXPLORER dynamic [11C]CFT PET/CT imaging with voxel-wise simplified reference tissue model (SRTM) kinetic modeling and semi-quantitative measures, we explored how the correlation pattern between nigrostriatal and digestive regions differed between the healthy participants as controls (HC) and patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).

Methods: Eleven participants (six HCs and five PDs) underwent 75-min dynamic [11C]CFT scans on a total-body PET/CT scanner (uEXPLORER, United Imaging Healthcare) were retrospectively enrolled. Time activity curves for four nigrostriatal nuclei (caudate, putamen, pallidum, and substantia nigra) and three digestive organs (pancreas, stomach, and duodenum) were obtained. Total-body parametric images of relative transporter rate constant (R1) and distribution volume ratio (DVR) were generated using the SRTM with occipital lobe as the reference tissue and a linear regression with spatial-constraint algorithm. Standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) at early (1-3 min, SUVREP) and late (60-75 min, SUVRLP) phases were calculated as the semi-quantitative substitutes for R1and DVR, respectively.

Results: Significant differences in estimates between the HC and PD groups were identified in DVR and SUVRLPof putamen (DVR: 4.82 ± 1.58 vs. 2.58 ± 0.53; SUVRLP: 4.65 ± 1.36 vs. 2.84 ± 0.67; for HC and PD, respectively, both p < 0.05) and SUVREPof stomach (1.12 ± 0.27 vs. 2.27 ± 0.65 for HC and PD, respectively; p < 0.01). In the HC group, negative correlations were observed between stomach and substantia nigra in both the R1and SUVREPvalues (r=-0.83, p < 0.05 for R1; r=-0.94, p < 0.01 for SUVREP). Positive correlations were identified between pancreas and putamen in both DVR and SUVRLPvalues (r = 0.94, p < 0.01 for DVR; r = 1.00, p < 0.001 for SUVRLP). By contrast, in the PD group, no correlations were found between the aforementioned target nigrostriatal and digestive areas.

Conclusions: The parametric images of R1and DVR generated from the SRTM model, along with SUVREPand SUVRLP, were proposed to quantify dynamic total-body [11C]CFT PET/CT in HC and PD groups. The distinction in correlation patterns of nigrostriatal and digestive regions between HC and PD groups identified by R1and DVR, or SUVRs, may provide new insights into the disease mechanism.

ABSTRACT:
Digital PET/CT systems with a long axial field of view have become available and are emerging as the current state of the art. These new camera systems provide wider anatomic coverage, leading to major increases in system sensitivity. Preliminary results have demonstrated improvements in image quality and quantification, as well as substantial advantages in tracer kinetic modeling from dynamic imaging. These systems also potentially allow for low-dose examinations and major reductions in acquisition time. Thereby, they hold great promise to improve PET-based interrogation of cardiac physiology and biology. Additionally, the whole-body coverage enables simultaneous assessment of multiple organs and the large vascular structures of the body, opening new opportunities for imaging systemic mechanisms, disorders, or treatments and their interactions with the cardiovascular system as a whole. The aim of this perspective document is to debate the potential applications, challenges, opportunities, and remaining challenges of applying PET/CT with a long axial field of view to the field of cardiovascular disease.

ABSTRACT:
Targeting receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) has emerged as a promising therapeutic stratagem for neurodegenerative disorders, particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD). A positron emission tomography (PET) probe enabling brain RIPK1 imaging can provide a powerful tool to unveil the neuropathology associated with RIPK1. Herein, the development of a new PET radioligand, [11C]CNY-10 is reported, which may enable brain RIPK1 imaging. [11C]CNY-10 is radiosynthesized with a high radiochemical yield (41.8%) and molar activity (305 GBq/µmol). [11C]CNY-10 is characterized by PET imaging in rodents and a non-human primate, demonstrating good brain penetration, binding specificity, and a suitable clearance kinetic profile. It is performed autoradiography of [11C]CNY-10 in human AD and healthy control postmortem brain tissues, which shows strong radiosignal in AD brains higher than healthy controls. Subsequently, it is conducted further characterization of RIPK1 in AD using [11C]CNY-10-based PET studies in combination with immunohistochemistry leveraging the 5xFAD mouse model. It is found that AD mice revealed RIPK1 brain signal significantly higher than WT control mice and that RIPK1 is closely related to amyloid plaques in the brain. The studies enable further translational studies of [11C]CNY-10 for AD and potentially other RIPK1-related human studies.

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Bexmarilimab is a new humanized monoclonal antibody against common lymphatic endothelial and vascular endothelial receptor-1 (CLEVER-1) and is in clinical trials for macrophage-guided cancer immunotherapy. In addition being associated with cancer, CLEVER-1 is also associated with fibrosis. To facilitate prospective human PET studies, we preclinically evaluated89Zr-labeled bexmarilimab in rabbits.Methods:Bexmarilimab was conjugated with desferrioxamine (DFO) and radiolabeled with89Zr. Retained immunoreactivity was confirmed by flow cytometry. The distribution kinetics of intravenously administered89Zr-DFO-bexmarilimab (0.1 mg/kg) were determined for up to 7 d in a rabbit model of renal fibrosis mediated by unilateral ureteric obstruction. The in vivo stability of89Zr-DFO-bexmarilimab was evaluated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in combination with autoradiography. Additionally, we estimated the human radiation dose from data obtained in healthy rabbits.Results:89Zr-DFO-bexmarilimab cleared rapidly from the blood circulation and distributed to the liver and spleen. At 24 h after injection, PET/CT, ex vivo γ-counting, and autoradiography demonstrated that there was significantly higher89Zr-DFO-bexmarilimab uptake in unilateral ureteric obstruction-operated fibrotic renal cortex, characterized by abundant CLEVER-1-positive cells, than in contralateral or healthy kidneys. The estimated effective dose for a 70-kg human was 0.70 mSv/MBq.Conclusion:The characteristics of89Zr-DFO-bexmarilimab support future human PET studies to, for example, stratify patients for bexmarilimab treatment, evaluate the efficacy of treatment, or monitor disease progression.

TITLE: Modulating Local Electron Density in NDI-Based CPs to Accelerate Photoinduced Electron Transfer for Ultrafast Violet Light Detection

AUTHORS: Gao-Peng Li, Jia-Ling Wen, Liu Yang, Yun-Long Fu, Kun Zhang, Xue Mao, Yao-Yu Wang

JOURNAL: Inorganic chemistry

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Realizing rapid photoinduced electron transfer (PET) in donor-acceptor (D-A) systems is crucial. The relative energy levels of donors and acceptors, as well as the local electron density, are two important factors determining the rate of photoinduced electron transfer in donor-acceptor (D-A) systems. However, systematic studies on the structure-functional relationship regarding the local electron density factor, based on precise structural models are rarely reported. Herein, we report a strategy for fabricating donor-acceptor coordination polymers (D-A CPs) that facilitates PET and enables evaluation of reaction kinetics through local electron density modulation, using two NDI-based CPs, [Cd2(dtNDI)(HBTC)(DMF)4] (1) and [Cd2(dtNDI)(H2BTEC)(DMF)4] (2), as proof-of-concept systems. By tuning carboxylate coordination-site electron density, compound2achieves a 10-fold PET rate increase (0.11953 → 1.15777 s-1) compared with1and demonstrates rapid photochromism (4 s coloration). The extra carboxylates in H2BTEC2-lower the electron density at the coordination site, suppressing charge transfer (CT) while enhancing PET, which establishes that local electron density governs PET efficiency. Compound2also shows exceptional 400 nm violet-light sensitivity, making it ideal for violet-light detection and filtering applications. This work provides a precise structural model for mechanistic insights into PET control.

JOURNAL: The Science of the total environment

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
2-Phosphonobutane-1,2,4,-tricarboxylic acid (PBTC) is an orthophosphate compound widely used as an antiscalant chemical and corrosion inhibitor in manufacturing. However, PBTC poses persistent environmental concerns due to its stability and resistance to conventional water treatment. In addressing the issues of PBTC in aquatic systems, Al-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been developed and applied as sustainable adsorbents. The materials are synthesized from terephthalic acid (TPA) linkers derived from upcycling products of post-consumer polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles. The PET-derived linker was prepared using alkaline hydrolysis followed by acidification and employed in forming MIL-53 (Al), with a comparative assessment against the corresponding MOFs made from commercial-grade TPA. The structures and properties of the materials were characterized with microscopic and spectroscopic methods. The synthesized adsorbents achieved a phosphate adsorption capacity of 826 mg/g at pH 5, with kinetics fitting a pseudo-second-order model and isotherm patterns aligning with Langmuir, Freundlich, and Sips models, indicative of diverse adsorption on heterogeneous surfaces. The results highlight the role of electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonding mechanisms in PBTC adsorption. The eco-friendly materials with high adsorption performance offer an innovative route for sustainable waste management and water purification.

TITLE: Removal of PET Microfibers from Simulated Wastewater Using Magnetic Nano-Ferric-Loaded Biochar: High Adsorption and Regeneration Performance

AUTHORS: Beisi Song, Nini Duan, Huaguo Xia, Yuan Li, Hongbin Xu, Ying Geng, Xin Wang

JOURNAL: Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) microfibers in effluent are difficult to remove using technology. In this study, a novel nano-sized iron-oxide-loaded biochar (FBC) with robust magnetic response characteristics was prepared by the impregnation-pyrolysis method and used for the removal of PET microfibers in simulated wastewater. The results showed that the removal efficiency of FBC on PET exceeded 91.69% over a wide pH range (4~9) and was barely affected by co-existing COD (15~500 mg/L) at an initial PET concentration of 1 g/L and FBC dosage of 3 g/L. The adsorption kinetics and isotherms indicated that the adsorption was more consistent with the pseudo-second-order kinetics (PSO) model and the Langmuir model, suggesting that the adsorption involved both physical and chemical actions. In addition, the maximum PET adsorption capacity expected by the Langmuir model reached 4500 mg/g, confirming the high adsorption performance of FBC. The characterization of FBC before and after adsorption indicated that PET was adsorbed mainly by the formation of Fe-O-PET bonds, π-π interactions, and hydrogen bonding. In addition, the FBC maintained a high PET removal efficiency of over 95.59% after four consecutive regeneration cycles. This study provides new insights into the efficient removal of fibrous microplastics from wastewater.

ABSTRACT:
The design of effective nanoformulations that target metastatic breast cancers is challenging due to a lack of competent imaging and image analysis protocols that can capture the interactions between the injected nanoparticles and metastatic lesions. Here, we describe the integration ofin vivowhole-body PET-CT with high temporal resolution,ex vivowhole-organ optical imaging and high spatial resolution confocal microscopy to deconstruct the trafficking of injectable nanoparticle generators encapsulated with polymeric doxorubicin (iNPG-pDox) in pulmonary metastases of triple-negative breast cancer. We describe the details of image acquisition and analysis in a step-wise manner along with the development of a mouse model for metastatic breast cancer. The methods described herein can be easily adapted to any nanoparticle or disease model, allowing a standardized pipeline forin vivopreclinical studies that focus on delineating nanoparticle kinetics and interactions within metastases.

TITLE: Crystal Violet Selectively Detects Aβ Oligomers but Not Fibrils In Vitro and in Alzheimer's Disease Brain Tissue

AUTHORS: Kanchana Karunarathne, Teresa R Kee, Hanna Jeon, Sara Cazzaro, Yasith I Gamage, Jianjun Pan, Jung-A A Woo, David E Kang, Martin Muschol

JOURNAL: Biomolecules

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Deposition of extracellular Amyloid Beta (Aβ) and intracellular tau fibrils in post-mortem brains remains the only way to conclusively confirm cases of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Substantial evidence, though, implicates small globular oligomers instead of fibrils as relevant biomarkers of, and critical contributors to, the clinical symptoms of AD. Efforts to verify and utilize amyloid oligomers as AD biomarkers in vivo have been limited by the near-exclusive dependence on conformation-selective antibodies for oligomer detection. While antibodies have yielded critical evidence for the role of both Aβ and tau oligomers in AD, they are not suitable for imaging amyloid oligomers in vivo. Therefore, it would be desirable to identify a set of oligomer-selective small molecules for subsequent development into Positron Emission Tomography (PET) probes. Using a kinetics-based screening assay, we confirm that the triarylmethane dye Crystal Violet (CV) is oligomer-selective for Aβ42 oligomers (AβOs) grown under near-physiological solution conditions in vitro. In postmortem brains of an AD mouse model and human AD patients, we demonstrate that A11 antibody-positive oligomers but not Thioflavin S (ThioS)-positive fibrils colocalize with CV staining, confirming in vitro results. Therefore, our kinetic screen represents a robust approach for identifying new classes of small molecules as candidates for oligomer-selective dyes (OSDs). Such OSDs, in turn, provide promising starting points for the development of PET probes for pre-mortem imaging of oligomer deposits in humans.

TITLE: Reaction Pathways for the Enzymatic Degradation of Poly(Ethylene Terephthalate): What Characterizes an Efficient PET-Hydrolase?

JOURNAL: Chembiochem : a European journal of chemical biology

ABSTRACT:
Bioprocessing of polyester waste has emerged as a promising tool in the quest for a cyclic plastic economy. One key step is the enzymatic breakdown of the polymer, and this entails a complicated pathway with substrates, intermediates, and products of variable size and solubility. We have elucidated this pathway for poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) and four enzymes. Specifically, we combined different kinetic measurements and a novel stochastic model and found that the ability to hydrolyze internal bonds in the polymer (endo-lytic activity) was a key parameter for overall enzyme performance. Endo-lytic activity promoted the release of soluble PET fragments with two or three aromatic rings, which, in turn, were broken down with remarkable efficiency (kcat/KMvalues of about 105M-1s-1) in the aqueous bulk. This meant that approximatly 70 % of the final, monoaromatic products were formed via soluble di- or tri-aromatic intermediates.

TITLE: Exploration of (R)-[11C]YH168 as a PET tracer for imaging monoacylglycerol lipase in the brain: from mice to non-human primates

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: The monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) plays a pivotal role in modulating the endocannabinoid system and is considered an attractive therapeutic target for diseases in both the central nervous system and periphery. The current study aimed to develop and evaluate a suitable carbon-11 labeled tracer for imaging MAGL in preclinical studies.

Methods: (R)-YH168 was synthesized via a multi-step pathway and its half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values were measured using an enzymatic assay. Radiosynthesis of (R)-[11C]YH168 was accomplished by11C-methylation via Suzuki cross-coupling of a pinacol boron precursor. In vitro autoradiography was performed using brain tissues from MAGL knockout and the corresponding wild-type mice. The metabolic stability of (R)-[11C]YH168 in mouse brain and plasma was assessed 5 min after injection. Dynamic PET scans were conducted on anesthetized mice and rhesus monkey. For studies in non-human primates, arterial blood samples were analyzed to obtain the input function for kinetic modeling. Blocking studies with the irreversible MAGL inhibitor PF-06795071 were performed to assess the binding specificity of (R)-[11C]YH168.

Results: (R)-[11C]YH168 was synthesized via Suzuki coupling of the phenyl boronic ester with [11C]CH3I in the presence of palladium catalyst. In vitro autoradiography revealed a heterogeneous distribution pattern of (R)-[11C]YH168 with higher binding to MAGL-rich brain regions in wild-type mouse brain slices compared to that of MAGL knockout mice. Dynamic PET imaging in wild-type and MAGL knockout mice confirmed its high specificity and selectivity in mouse brains. In the rhesus monkey, (R)-[11C]YH168 displayed good brain permeability. High levels of radioactivity uptake were seen in the cingulate cortex, frontal cortex, cerebellum, occipital cortex, and hippocampus, consistent with MAGL expression. The one-tissue compartment model was appropriate for fitting the regional time-activity curves and provided reliable volume of distribution values across all brain regions. Pretreatment with PF-06795071 (0.1 mg/kg) resulted in almost complete blockade (> 95%) of radioactivity uptake, demonstrating binding specificity of (R)-[11C]YH168 to MAGL in the non-human primate brain. The regional non-displaceable binding potential follows the rank order of cingulate cortex ~ frontal cortex ~ insula > putamen > temporal cortex > caudate ~ occipital cortex ~ thalamus > nucleus accumbens ~ hippocampus ~ cerebellum ~ globus pallidus > substantia nigra > amygdala.

Conclusion: (R)-[11C]YH168 is a promising PET probe for imaging and quantifying MAGL in the brains of mice and non-human primates. This11C-labeled tracer holds great potential for translation into human subjects and offers the possibility of performing multiple PET scans on the same subject within a single day.

TITLE: Remediation of multifarious metal ions and molecular docking assessment for pathogenic microbe disinfection in aqueous solution by waste-derived Ca-MOF

AUTHORS: Anil Kumar K, Yeshwanth Mahesh, Jitendra Panwar, Suresh Gupta

JOURNAL: Environmental science and pollution research international

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
The present study demonstrates an eco-friendly and cost-effective synthesis of calcium terephthalate metal-organic frameworks (Ca-MOF). The Ca-MOF were composed of metal ions (Ca2+) and organic ligands (terephthalic acid; TPA); the former was obtained from egg shells, and the latter was obtained from processing waste plastic bottles. Detailed characterization using standard techniques confirmed the synthesis of Ca-MOF with an average particle size of 461.9 ± 15 nm. The synthesized Ca-MOF was screened for its ability to remove multiple metal ions from an aqueous solution. Based on the maximum sorption capacity, Pb2+, Cd2+, and Cu2+ions were selected for individual parametric batch studies. The obtained results were interpreted using standard isotherms and kinetic models. The maximum sorption capacity (qm) obtained from the Langmuir model was found to be 644.07 ± 47, 391.4 ± 26, and 260.5 ± 14 mg g-1for Pb2+, Cd2+, and Cu2+, respectively. Moreover, Ca-MOF also showed an excellent ability to remove all three metal ions simultaneously from a mixed solution. The metal nodes and bonded TPA from Ca-MOF were dissociated by the acid dissolution method, which protonated and isolated TPA for reuse. Further, the crystal structure of Ca-MOF was prepared and docked with protein targets of selected pathogenic water-borne microbes, which showed its disinfection potential. Overall, multiple metal sorption capability, regeneration studies, and broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity confirmed the versatility of synthesized Ca-MOF for industrial wastewater treatment.

ABSTRACT:
Absolute quantification of regional tissue concentration of radioactivity in positron emission tomography (PET) is a critical parameter-of-interest across various clinical and research applications and is affected by a complex interplay of factors including scanner calibration, data corrections, and image reconstruction. The emergence of long axial field-of-view (FOV) PET systems widens the dynamic range accessible to PET and creates new opportunities in reducing scan time and radiation dose, delayed or low radioactivity imaging, as well as kinetic modeling of the entire human. However, these imaging regimes impose challenging conditions for accurate quantification due to constraints from image reconstruction, low count conditions, as well as large and rapidly changing radioactivity distribution across a large axial FOV. We comprehensively evaluated the quantitative accuracy of the uEXPLORER total-body scanner in conditions that encompass existing and potential imaging applications (such as dynamic imaging and ultralow-dose imaging) using a set of total-body specific phantom and human measurements. Through these evaluations we demonstrated a relative count rate accuracy of ±3%-4% using the NEMA NU 2-2018 protocol, an axial uniformity spread of ±3% across the central 90% axial FOV, and a 3% activity bias spread from 17 to 474 MBq18F-FDG in a 210 cm long cylindrical phantom. Region-of-interest quantification spread of 1% was found by simultaneously scanning three NEMA NU 2 image quality phantoms, as well as relatively stable volume-of-interest quantification across 0.2%-100% of total counts through re-sampled datasets. In addition, an activity bias spread of -2% to +1% post-bolus injections in human subjects was found. Larger bias changes during the bolus injection phase in humans indicated the difficulty in providing accurate PET data corrections for complex activity distributions across a large dynamic range. Our results overall indicated that the quantitative performance achieved with the uEXPLORER scanner was uniform across the axial FOV and provided the accuracy necessary to support a wide range of imaging applications.

TITLE: Assessment of quantitative [18F]Sodium fluoride PET measures of knee subchondral bone perfusion and mineralization in osteoarthritic and healthy subjects

AUTHORS: L Watkins, J MacKay, B Haddock, V Mazzoli, S Uhlrich, G Gold, F Kogan

JOURNAL: Osteoarthritis and cartilage

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Objective: Molecular information derived from dynamic [18F]sodium fluoride ([18F]NaF) PET imaging holds promise as a quantitative marker of bone metabolism. The objective of this work was to evaluate physiological mechanisms of [18F]NaF uptake in subchondral bone of individuals with and without knee osteoarthritis (OA).

Methods: Eleven healthy volunteers and twenty OA subjects were included. Both knees of all subjects were scanned simultaneously using a 3T hybrid PET/MRI system. MRI MOAKS assessment was performed to score the presence and size of osteophytes, bone marrow lesions, and cartilage lesions. Subchondral bone kinetic parameters of bone perfusion (K1), tracer extraction fraction, and total tracer uptake into bone (Ki) were evaluated using the Hawkins 3-compartment model. Measures were compared between structurally normal-appearing bone regions and those with structural findings.

Results: Mean and maximum SUV and kinetic parameters Ki, K1, and extraction fraction were significantly different between Healthy subjects and subjects with OA. Between-group differences in metabolic parameters were observed both in regions where the OA group had degenerative changes as well as in regions that appeared structurally normal.

Conclusions: Results suggest that bone metabolism is altered in OA subjects, including bone regions with and without structural findings, compared to healthy subjects. Kinetic parameters of [18F]NaF uptake in subchondral bone show potential to quantitatively evaluate the role of bone physiology in OA initiation and progression. Objective measures of bone metabolism from [18F]NaF PET imaging can complement assessments of structural abnormalities observed on MRI.

TITLE: MCP-Net: Inter-frame Motion Correction with Patlak Regularization for Whole-body Dynamic PET

AUTHORS: Xueqi Guo, Bo Zhou, Xiongchao Chen, Chi Liu, Nicha C Dvornek

JOURNAL: Medical image computing and computer-assisted intervention : MICCAI ... International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Inter-frame patient motion introduces spatial misalignment and degrades parametric imaging in whole-body dynamic positron emission tomography (PET). Most current deep learning inter-frame motion correction works consider only the image registration problem, ignoring tracer kinetics. We propose an inter-frame Motion Correction framework with Patlak regularization (MCP-Net) to directly optimize the Patlak fitting error and further improve model performance. The MCP-Net contains three modules: a motion estimation module consisting of a multiple-frame 3-D U-Net with a convolutional long short-term memory layer combined at the bottleneck; an image warping module that performs spatial transformation; and an analytical Patlak module that estimates Patlak fitting with the motion-corrected frames and the individual input function. A Patlak loss penalization term using mean squared percentage fitting error is introduced to the loss function in addition to image similarity measurement and displacement gradient loss. Following motion correction, the parametric images were generated by standard Patlak analysis. Compared with both traditional and deep learning benchmarks, our network further corrected the residual spatial mismatch in the dynamic frames, improved the spatial alignment of PatlakKi/Vbimages, and reduced normalized fitting error. With the utilization of tracer dynamics and enhanced network performance, MCP-Net has the potential for further improving the quantitative accuracy of dynamic PET. Our code is released at https://github.com/gxq1998/MCP-Net.

TITLE: In silico screening of photostabilizing reagents for cyanine-based single molecule fluorescence

AUTHORS: Jorge E Ramos-Sanchez, Yasser Gidi, Terri C Lovell, Liam Payne, Aya Sakaya, Gonzalo Cosa

JOURNAL: Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Fluorophore signal and photostability are desirable when conducting single molecule fluorescence (SMF) studies. For cyanine dyes, this is typically achieved by quenching their excited triplet statesviaphotoinduced electron transfer (PeT). However, to date, only a handful of electron donors or acceptors have been - empirically - identified, most of which do not show diffusion controlled PeT quenching rate constants (k). Here we report a screening tool to rapidly explore the potential of thiol-based electron donors to serve as photostabilizers of Cy3, Cy5, and their bridged congeners Cy3B and Cy5B. Based on density functional theory (DFT) and utilizing Marcus theory of electron transfer, our method estimatesin silicothe activation free energy of PeT. A correlation function is then established between theoretical estimates and empirical values ofkacquired through transient absorption spectroscopy. The correlation function then enables screening of the photostabilizing potential of untested reagents from a kinetic standpoint. A new compound, glyceryl monothioglycolate (GMTG), was thus identified. SMF studies show the effectiveness of GMTG as a domestic use, non-toxic, non-volatile alternative to the widely utilized β-mercaptoethanol. Altogether, a predictive model is proposed toward discovering photostabilizers to achieve single molecule fluorescence experiments with enhanced photo- and signal stability.

TITLE: Model Corrected Blood Input Function to Compute Cerebral FDG Uptake Rates From Dynamic Total-Body PET Images of Rats in vivo

AUTHORS: James C Massey, Vikram Seshadri, Soumen Paul, Krzysztof Mińczuk, Cesar Molinos, Jie Li, Bijoy K Kundu

JOURNAL: Frontiers in medicine

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Recently, we developed a three-compartment dual-output model that incorporates spillover (SP) and partial volume (PV) corrections to simultaneously estimate the kinetic parameters and model-corrected blood input function (MCIF) from dynamic 2-[18F] fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET) images of mouse heartin vivo. In this study, we further optimized this model and utilized the estimated MCIF to compute cerebral FDG uptake rates,Ki, from dynamic total-body FDG PET images of control Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats and compared to those derived from arterial blood samplingin vivo. Dynamic FDG PET scans of WKY rats (n= 5), fasted for 6 h, were performed using the Albira Si Trimodal PET/SPECT/CT imager for 60 min. Arterial blood samples were collected for the entire imaging duration and then fitted to a seven-parameter function. The 60-min list mode PET data, corrected for attenuation, scatter, randoms, and decay, were reconstructed into 23 time bins. A 15-parameter dual-output model with SP and PV corrections was optimized with two cost functions to compute MCIF. A four-parameter compartment model was then used to compute cerebral Ki. The computed area under the curve (AUC) andKiwere compared to that derived from arterial blood samples. Experimental and computed AUCs were 1,893.53 ± 195.39 kBq min/cc and 1,792.65 ± 155.84 kBq min/cc, respectively (p= 0.76). Bland-Altman analysis of experimental vs. computedKifor 35 cerebral regions in WKY rats revealed a mean difference of 0.0029 min-1(~13.5%). Direct (AUC) and indirect (Ki) comparisons of model computations with arterial blood sampling were performed in WKY rats. AUC and the downstream cerebral FDG uptake rates compared well with that obtained using arterial blood samples. Experimental vs. computed cerebralKifor the four super regions including cerebellum, frontal cortex, hippocampus, and striatum indicated no significant differences.

TITLE: MCP-Net: Introducing Patlak Loss Optimization to Whole-body Dynamic PET Inter-frame Motion Correction

AUTHORS: Xueqi Guo, Bo Zhou, Xiongchao Chen, Ming-Kai Chen, Chi Liu, Nicha C Dvornek

JOURNAL: IEEE transactions on medical imaging

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
In whole-body dynamic positron emission tomography (PET), inter-frame subject motion causes spatial misalignment and affects parametric imaging. Many of the current deep learning inter-frame motion correction techniques focus solely on the anatomy-based registration problem, neglecting the tracer kinetics that contains functional information. To directly reduce the Patlak fitting error for18F-FDG and further improve model performance, we propose an interframe motion correction framework with Patlak loss optimization integrated into the neural network (MCP-Net). The MCP-Net consists of a multiple-frame motion estimation block, an image-warping block, and an analytical Patlak block that estimates Patlak fitting using motion-corrected frames and the input function. A novel Patlak loss penalty component utilizing mean squared percentage fitting error is added to the loss function to reinforce the motion correction. The parametric images were generated using standard Patlak analysis following motion correction. Our framework enhanced the spatial alignment in both dynamic frames and parametric images and lowered normalized fitting error when compared to both conventional and deep learning benchmarks. MCP-Net also achieved the lowest motion prediction error and showed the best generalization capability. The potential of enhancing network performance and improving the quantitative accuracy of dynamic PET by directly utilizing tracer kinetics is suggested.

JOURNAL: International journal of cancer

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) is an innovative radiation oncology approach that targets tumors selectively, minimizing damage to healthy tissues through high-linear-energy-transfer particles released during the boron neutron capture reaction. Current boron carriers like sodium mercaptoundecahydrododecaborate (BSH) and L-p-boronophenylalanine (BPA) face limitations in specificity and solubility. Our recently developed 6-O-(o-carboranylmethyl)-d-glucopyranose (B-Glc) shows promise as an alternative, demonstrating strong interactions with glucose transporters in human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) CAL 27 cells in vitro. This study aims to extend in vitro investigations to three additional patient-derived human HNSCC cell lines (UT-SCC-14, UT-SCC-28, and UT-SCC-42B) and to further evaluate in vivo pharmacokinetics in selected HNSCC tumor xenografts. The B-Glc showed superior uptake and favorable kinetic parameters compared to BPA and BSH in all tested cell lines. Initial positron emission tomography imaging using [18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose ([18F]FDG) radiotracer confirmed increased glucose uptake in CAL 27 and UT-SCC-14 tumors in vivo, supported by glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) expression observed in tumor section immunohistochemistry. Biodistribution studies of the B-Glc (75 mg/kg dose) revealed no significant impact of blood glucose levels on tumor uptake, with peak boron accumulation at 15-30 min post-injection, comparable uptake to the clinical BPA-fructose complex (400 mg/kg dose) performance at 60 min, achieving the required tumor boron concentration (>20 ppm) for effective BNCT. Overall, this study underscores an advancement in targeted BNCT, highlighting B-Glc as an effective GLUT1-targeting carrier for enhanced therapeutic outcome in HNSCC and the potential to use [18F]FDG as a companion diagnostic for the glucoconjugate.

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Background: The cysteine-aspartic acid protease caspase-3 is recognized as the main executioner of apoptosis in cells responding to specific extrinsic and intrinsic stimuli. Caspase-3 represents an interesting biomarker to evaluate treatment response, as many cancer therapies exert their effect by inducing tumour cell death. Previously developed caspase-3 PET tracers were unable to reach routine clinical use due to low tumour uptake or lack of target selectivity, which are two important requirements for effective treatment response evaluation in cancer patients. Therefore, the goal of this study was to develop and preclinically evaluate novel caspase-3-selective activity-based probes (ABPs) for apoptosis imaging.

Results: A library of caspase-3-selective ABPs was developed for tumour apoptosis detection. In a first attempt, the inhibitor Ac-DW3-KE (Ac-3Pal-Asp-βhLeu-Phe-Asp-KE) was18F-labelled on the N-terminus to generate a radiotracer that was incapable of adequately detecting an increase in apoptosis in vivo. The inability to effectively detect active caspase-3 in vivo was likely attributable to slow binding, as demonstrated with in vitro inhibition kinetics. Hence, a second generation of caspase-3 selective ABPs was developed based on the Ac-ATS010-KE (Ac-3Pal-Asp-Phe(F5)-Phe-Asp-KE) with greatly improved binding kinetics over Ac-DW3-KE. Our probes based on Ac-ATS010-KE were made by modifying the N-terminus with 6 different linkers. All the linker modifications had limited effect on the binding kinetics, target selectivity, and pharmacokinetic profile in healthy mice. In an in vitro apoptosis model, the least hydrophilic tracer [18F]MICA-316 showed an increased uptake in apoptotic cells in comparison to the control group. Finally, [18F]MICA-316 was tested in an in vivo colorectal cancer model, where it showed a limited tumour uptake and was unable to discriminate treated tumours from the untreated group, despite demonstrating that the radiotracer was able to bind caspase-3 in complex mixtures in vitro. In contrast, the phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)-binding radiotracer [99mTc]Tc-duramycin was able to recognize the increased cell death in the disease model, making it the best performing treatment response assessment tracer developed thus far.

Conclusions: In conclusion, a novel library of caspase-3-binding PET tracers retaining similar binding kinetics as the original inhibitor was developed. The most promising tracer, [18F]MICA-316, showed an increase uptake in an in vitro apoptosis model and was able to selectively bind caspase-3 in apoptotic tumour cells. In order to distinguish therapy-responsive from non-responsive tumours, the next generation of caspase-3-selective ABPs will be developed with higher tumour accumulation and in vivo stability.

TITLE: Should we redefine the Phoenix criteria for biochemical recurrence after primary radiotherapy?

AUTHORS: Ugo Giovanni Falagario, Francesco Pellegrino, Peter Wiklund

JOURNAL: Current opinion in urology

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Purpose of review: The Phoenix criteria, which define biochemical recurrence (BCR) after radiotherapy as a prostate specific antigen (PSA) rise of at least 2 ng/ml above nadir, were developed to improve consistency in outcome reporting and distinguish genuine cancer recurrence from transient, noncancerous PSA fluctuations, commonly referred to as PSA "bounces". However, in the current era of advanced imaging and precision oncology, this definition is increasingly viewed as inadequate. This review critically examines recent evidence challenging the clinical utility of the Phoenix definition and explores potential alternatives that better reflect disease biology and patient outcomes.

Recent findings: Modern imaging techniques, particularly prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET/computed tomography (CT), have demonstrated the ability to detect recurrent prostate cancer at PSA levels well below the Phoenix threshold, allowing for earlier salvage interventions. Additionally, PSA kinetics such as nadir levels and doubling time provide superior prognostic information compared to static PSA thresholds. Multiparametric risk models that also incorporate PSMA PET/CT findings, PSA kinetics and clinical features may enable more accurate stratification of patients into low-risk and high-risk BCR categories. This evolving approach supports the notion that early, risk-adapted treatment can improve outcomes in high-risk patients, while reducing overtreatment in those at low risk.

Summary: The Phoenix criteria no longer align with the capabilities of current diagnostic and prognostic tools. Redefining BCR using dynamic PSA metrics and advanced imaging could facilitate timely salvage treatment in patients at a high risk and allow surveillance strategies in those unlikely to progress. Prospective validation is warranted to inform future clinical guidelines.

TITLE: Avian neurons consume three times less glucose than mammalian neurons

AUTHORS: Kaya von Eugen, Heike Endepols, Alexander Drzezga, Bernd Neumaier, Onur Güntürkün, Heiko Backes, Felix Ströckens

JOURNAL: Current biology : CB

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Brains are among the most energetically costly tissues in the mammalian body.1This is predominantly caused by expensive neurons with high glucose demands.2Across mammals, the neuronal energy budget appears to be fixed, possibly posing an evolutionary constraint on brain growth.3-6Compared to similarly sized mammals, birds have higher numbers of neurons, and this advantage conceivably contributes to their cognitive prowess.7We set out to determine the neuronal energy budget of birds to elucidate how they can metabolically support such high numbers of neurons. We estimated glucose metabolism using positron emission tomography (PET) and 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxyglucose ([18F]FDG) as the radiotracer in awake and anesthetized pigeons. Combined with kinetic modeling, this is the gold standard to quantify cerebral metabolic rate of glucose consumption (CMRglc).8We found that neural tissue in the pigeon consumes 27.29 ± 1.57 μmol glucose per 100 g per min in an awake state, which translates into a surprisingly low neuronal energy budget of 1.86 × 10-9± 0.2 × 10-9μmol glucose per neuron per minute. This is approximately 3 times lower than the rate in the average mammalian neuron.3The remarkably low neuronal energy budget explains how pigeons, and possibly other avian species, can support such high numbers of neurons without associated metabolic costs or compromising neuronal signaling. The advantage in neuronal processing of information at a higher efficiency possibly emerged during the distinct evolution of the avian brain.

TITLE: Intravenous and oral whole body ketone dosimetry, biodistribution, metabolite correction and kinetics studied by (R)-[1-11C]β-hydroxybutyrate ([11C]OHB) PET in healthy humans

AUTHORS: Thien Vinh Luong, Erik Nguyen Nielsen, Lise Falborg, Mette Louise Gram Kjærulff, Lars Poulsen Tolbod, Esben Søndergaard, Niels Møller, Ole Lajord Munk, Lars Christian Gormsen

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Background: Ketones are increasingly recognized as an important and possibly oxygen sparing source of energy in vital organs such as the heart, the brain and the kidneys. Drug treatments, dietary regimens and oral ketone drinks designed to deliver ketones for organ and tissue energy production have therefore gained popularity. However, whether ingested ketones are taken up by various extra-cerebral tissues and to what extent is still largely unexplored. It was therefore the aim of this study to use positron emission tomography (PET) to explore the whole body dosimetry, biodistribution and kinetics of the ketone tracer (R)-[1-11C]β-hydroxybutyrate ([11C]OHB). Six healthy subjects (3 women and 3 men) underwent dynamic PET studies after both intravenous (90 min) and oral (120 min) administration of [11C]OHB. Dosimetry estimates of [11C]OHB was calculated using OLINDA/EXM software, biodistribution was assessed visually and [11C]OHB tissue kinetics were obtained using an arterial input function and tissue time-activity curves.

Results: Radiation dosimetry yielded effective doses of 3.28 [Formula: see text]Sv/MBq (intravenous administration) and 12.51 [Formula: see text]Sv/MBq (oral administration). Intravenous administration of [11C]OHB resulted in avid radiotracer uptake in the heart, liver, and kidneys, whereas lesser uptake was observed in the salivary glands, pancreas, skeletal muscle and red marrow. Only minimal uptake was noted in the brain. Oral ingestion of the tracer resulted in rapid radiotracer appearance in the blood and radiotracer uptake in the heart, liver and kidneys. In general, [11C]OHB tissue kinetics after intravenous administration were best described by a reversible 2-tissue compartmental model.

Conclusion: The PET radiotracer [11C]OHB shows promising potential in providing imaging data on ketone uptake in various physiologically relevant tissues. As a result, it may serve as a safe and non-invasive imaging tool for exploring ketone metabolism in organs and tissues of both patients and healthy individuals.

ABSTRACT:
This study investigated whether Ki-Patlak derived from a shortened scan time for dynamic18F-NaF PET/CT in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients undergoing hemodialysis can provide predictive accuracy comparable to that obtained from a longer scan. Twenty-seven patients on chronic hemodialysis, involving a total of 42 scans between December 2021 and August 2023 were recruited. Dynamic18F-NaF PET/CT scans, lasting 60-90 min, were immediately acquired post-injection, covering the mid-twelfth thoracic vertebra to the pelvis region. Ki-Patlak analysis was performed on bone time-activity curves at 15, 30, 45, 60, and 90 min in the lumbar spine (L1-L4) and both anterior iliac crests. Spearman's rank correlation (rs) and interclass correlation coefficient were used to assess the correlation and agreement of Ki-Patlak between shortened and standard scan times. Bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BsAP) and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase isoform 5b (TRAP5b) were tested for their correlation with individual Ki-Patlak. Strong correlations and good agreement were observed between Ki-Patlak values from shortened 30-min scans and longer 60-90-min scans in both lumbar spine (rs= 0.858, p < 0.001) and anterior iliac crest regions (rs= 0.850, p < 0.001). The correlation between BsAP and Ki-Patlak in the anterior iliac crests was weak and statistically insignificant. This finding suggests that a proposed shortened dynamic18F-NaF PET/CT scan is effective in assessing bone metabolic flux in CKD patients undergoing hemodialysis, offering a non-invasive alternative approach for bone turnover prediction.

ABSTRACT:
Plastic waste poses a serious environmental risk, but it can be recycled to produce a variety of nanomaterials for water treatment. In this study, poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) waste and acid mine drainage were used in the preparation of magnetic mesoporous carbon (MMC) nanocomposites for the adsorptive removal of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) from water samples. The latter were then characterized using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), and ζ potential. The results of Brunauer-Emmett-Teller isotherms revealed high specific surface areas of 404, 664, and 936 m2/g with corresponding pore sizes 2.51, 2.28, and 2.26 nm for MMC, MMAC-25%, and MMAC-50% adsorbents, respectively. Under optimized conditions, the equilibrium studies were best described by the Langmuir and Freundlich models and kinetics by the pseudo-second-order model. The maximum adsorption capacity for monolayer adsorption from the Langmuir model was 112, 102, and 106 mg/g for acetaminophen, caffeine, and carbamazepine, respectively. The composites could be reused for up to six cycles without losing their adsorption efficiency. Furthermore, prepared adsorbents were used to remove acetaminophen, caffeine, and carbamazepine from wastewater samples, and up to a 95% removal efficiency was attained.

TITLE: Slit dual-frequency ultrasound-assisted pulping of Lycium barbarum fresh fruit to improve the dissolution of polysaccharides and in situ real-time monitoring

AUTHORS: Tianyu Kong, Shuhan Liu, Yuqin Feng, Yanli Fan, Junwei Yu, Haihui Zhang, Meihong Cai, Haile Ma, Yuqing Duan

JOURNAL: Ultrasonics sonochemistry

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
In this study, the slit dual-frequency ultrasound-assisted pulping of fresh Lycium barbarum fruit was optimized to improve the dissolution of polysaccharides. The microscopic mechanism of polysaccharide dissolution was explored through establishing polysaccharides dissolution kinetics model and visualizing the multi-physical fields during ultrasonic process, and an in situ real-time monitoring model was established by the relationship between the chemical value and spectral information collected by near-infrared spectroscopy. The results showed that, under optimal conditions, treatment with ultrasound (28-33 kHz, 250 W, 30 min) not only significantly promoted the dissolution rate of polysaccharides in Lycium barbarum pulp (LBPPs, increased by 43.64 %, p < 0.01), reduced its molecular weight, but also improved the arabinose molar ratio, the uniformity of polysaccharide particles, and the antioxidant activity of LBPPs. Correlation analysis indicated that ultrasonic treatment is closely related to LBPPs content, particle size and scavenging capacity against superoxide anion radicals (ptotal sugar content< 0.01, pparticle size< 0.05 and psuperoxide anion scavenging< 0.05). Moreover, the in situ real-time monitoring model for the pulping process could quantitatively predict LBPPs dissolution rate and its superoxide anion radical scavenging capacity with good calibration and prediction performance (Rc = 0.9841, RMSECV = 0.0873, Rp = 0.9772, RMSEP = 0.0530; Rc = 0.9874, RMSECV = 0.1246, Rp = 0.9868, RMSEP = 0.0665). These results indicated that slit dual-frequency ultrasound has great potential in improving the quality of Lycium barbarum pulp, which may provide theoretical support for the industrial development of intelligent systems for polysaccharides preparation.

TITLE: Ultra-low-activity total-body dynamic PET imaging allows equal performance to full-activity PET imaging for investigating kinetic metrics of 18F-FDG in healthy volunteers

AUTHORS: Guobing Liu, Pengcheng Hu, Haojun Yu, Hui Tan, Yiqiu Zhang, Hongyan Yin, Yan Hu, Jianying Gu, Hongcheng Shi

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: To investigate the feasibility of ultra-low-activity total-body positron emission tomography (PET) dynamic imaging for quantifying kinetic metrics of 2-[18F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (18F-FDG) in normal organs and to verify its clinical relevance with full-activity imaging.

Methods: Dynamic total-body PET imaging was performed in 20 healthy volunteers, with eight using full activity (3.7 MBq/kg) of18F-FDG and 12 using 10× activity reduction (0.37 MBq/kg). Image contrast, in terms of liver-to-muscle ratio (LMR), liver-to-blood ratio (LBR), and blood-to-muscle ratio (BMR) of radioactivity concentrations were assessed. A two-tissue compartment model was fitted to the time-to-activity curves in organs based on regions of interest (ROIs) delineation using PMOD, and constant rates (k1, k2, and k3) were generated. Kinetic constants, corresponding coefficients of variance (CoVs), image contrast, radiation dose, prompt counts, and data size were compared between full- and low-activity groups.

Results: All constant rates, corresponding CoVs, and image contrast in different organs were comparable with none significant differences between full- and ultra-low-activity groups. PET images in the ultra-low-activity group generated significantly lower effective radiation dose (median, 0.419 vs. 4.886 mSv, P < 0.001), reduced prompt counts (median, 2.79 vs. 55.68 billion, P < 0.001), and smaller data size (median, 71.11 vs. 723.18 GB, P < 0.001).

Conclusion: Total-body dynamic PET imaging using 10× reduction of injected activity could achieve relevant kinetic metrics of18F-FDG and comparable image contrast with full-activity imaging. Activity reduction results in significant decrease of radiation dose and data size, rendering it more acceptable and easier for data reconstruction, transmission, and storage for clinical practice.

JOURNAL: Clinical and translational imaging

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Background: The small molecule radiotracer124I-PU-H71 is an imaging biomarker of epichaperome formation. The tracer has been established to localize in tissues under chronic stress, specifically in cancer cells and neurodegenerative brain cells. A first-in-human imaging trial using positron emission tomography (PET) in cancer patients revealed unexpected tracer accumulation in the myocardium.

Purpose: To describe human124I-PU-H71 myocardial biodistribution and pharmacokinetics in a series of cancer patients with no history of cardiovascular disease.

Methods: 25 cancer patients (age 22-75 years, M:F - 7:18) with no history of cardiovascular disease received intravenous injections with microdose124I-PU-H71 while at rest, followed by dynamic and gated/non-gated PET image data acquisitions. Region-of-interest (ROI) analysis of left ventricular myocardium (LVmyo) and background left atrium quantified tracer concentrations as standardized uptake value (SUV) and uptake ratios. Kinetic rate constants were evaluated by a two-tissue compartment model.

Results: Myocardial accumulation of124I-PU-H71 was prominent in all patients, with median LVmyo SUVmean (interquartile range, IQR) of 2.8 (IQR, 2.13-3.29), 2.5 (IQR, 1.94-2.98), 2.4 (IQR, 1.73-3.31) and 1.0 (IQR, 0.61-2.45), and median LVmyo/blood-pool ratios of 1.9 (IQR, 1.57-2.38), 2.0 (IQR, 1.53-2.32), 3.6 (IQR, 2.91-4.06) and 3.9 (IQR, 2.62-5.08) at 1-9 min, 14-23 min, 3-4 h and 21-25 h, respectively on non-gated PET images. Myocardium showed peak uptake within 2 min post-injection, with sustained myocardial tracer-concentration at 4 h post-injection. Pharmacokinetic modeling revealed median K1= 0.45 ml/min/g (IQR, 0.38-0.62); k2= 0.47 min- 1(IQR, 0.27-0.71); k3= 0.16 min- 1(IQR, 0.09-0.26); and k4= 0.0038 min- 1(IQR, 0.0015-0.0057). Regional assessment demonstrated essentially uniform tracer uptake in LV and myocardial segments; with normal LVEF in all patients (mean 57.7 ± 3.5%); and no patients suffered cardiac events over subsequent 12-month period.

Conclusion: Our study finds human myocardial epichaperome expression, as quantified by124I-PU-H71 PET. Our data indicates PU-H71 PET merits further study as a myocardial epichaperome biomarker, with potential application in drug development, possibly as a biomarker in subclinical cardiac dysfunction.

TITLE: Distinguishing benign from malignant lesions with high [68 Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 uptake in oncology patients: Insights from dynamic total-body [68 Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 PET/CT

AUTHORS: Ruohua Chen, Xinlan Yang, Lianghua Li, Haitao Zhao, Gang Huang, Jianjun Liu

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Background and purpose: While [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 PET/CT is widely used in various malignant tumors diagnosis, its specificity is challenged by high uptake in benign lesions such as inflammatory lymphadenopathy, bone fractures, and degenerative changes. This study aimed to quantitatively assess and characterize the metabolic heterogeneity of [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 uptake in benign and malignant lesions using dynamic total-body PET/CT.

Methods: Dynamic total-body [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 PET/CT scans (0-60 min post-injection) were performed on 17 oncology patients. Time-activity curves (TACs) were generated for benign and malignant lesions with high [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 uptake. The reversible two-tissue compartment model (2T4k) was used to derive kinetic metrics, including K1, k2, k3, k4, vBand VT. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to determine the cut-off values for differentiating benign and malignant lesions.

Results: The study included 58 malignant and 55 inflammatory lesions with high [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 uptake. Malignant lesions exhibited higher K1(0.277 ± 0.217 ml/ccm/min vs. 0.221 ± 0.216 ml/ccm/min, P = 0.011), vB(0.042 ± 0.007 vs. 0.013 ± 0.004, P < 0.001), and lower k3(0.267 ± 0.041 1/min vs. 0.481 ± 0.085 1/min, P = 0.008) compared to benign lesions. Lesions were classified into low, medium, and high-probability groups for being malignant based on K1, k3and vBvalues, with probabilities of 0%, 50.7%, and 92.0%, respectively (P < 0.001).

Conclusions: Kinetic metrics, particularly K1, k3and vBvalues, show promise as imaging biomarkers for distinguishing between benign and malignant lesions with high [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 uptake in oncology patients. These metrics reflect the metabolic heterogeneity of the lesions and may improve diagnostic accuracy in oncological imaging.

TITLE: Kinetic analysis of cardiac dynamic 18F-Florbetapir PET in healthy volunteers and amyloidosis patients: A pilot study

AUTHORS: Haiyan Wang, Bolun Li, Zhe Wang, Xing Chen, Zhiwen You, Yee Ling Ng, Qi Ge, Jianmin Yuan, Yun Zhou, Jun Zhao

JOURNAL: Heliyon

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Objectives: This study aimed to explore the potential of full dynamic PET kinetic analysis in assessing amyloid binding and perfusion in the cardiac region using18F-Florbetapir PET, establishing a quantitative approach in the clinical assessment of cardiac amyloidosis disease.

Materials & methods: The distribution volume ratios (DVRs) and the relative transport rate constant (R1), were estimated by a pseudo-simplified reference tissue model (pSRTM2) and pseudo-Logan plot (pLogan plot) with kidney reference for the region of interest-based and voxel-wise-based analyses. The parametric images generated using the pSRTM2 and linear regression with spatially constrained (LRSC) algorithm were then evaluated. Semi-quantitative analyses include standardized uptake value ratios at the early phase (SUVREP, 0.5-5 min) and late phase (SUVRLP, 50-60 min) were also calculated.

Results: Ten participants [7 healthy controls (HC) and 3 cardiac amyloidosis (CA) subjects] underwent a 60-min dynamic18F-Florbetapir PET scan. The DVRs estimated from pSRTM2 and Logan plot were significantly increased (HCvsCA; DVRpSRTM2: 0.95 ± 0.11vs2.77 ± 0.42,t'(2.13) = 7.39, P = 0.015; DVRLogan: 0.80 ± 0.12vs2.90 ± 0.55,t'(2.08) = 6.56,P= 0.020), and R1were remarkably decreased in CA groups, as compared to HCs (HCvsCA; 1.08 ± 0.37vs0.56 ± 0.10,t'(7.63) = 3.38,P= 0.010). The SUVREPand SUVRLPwere highly correlated to R1(r = 0.97,P< 0.001) and DVR(r = 0.99,P< 0.001), respectively. The DVRs in the total myocardium region increased slightly as the size of FWHM increased and became stable at a Gaussian filter ≥6 mm. The secular equilibrium of SUVR was reached at around 50-min p.i. time.

Conclusion: The DVR and R1estimated from cardiac dynamic18F-Florbetapir PET using pSRTM with kidney pseudo-reference tissue are suggested to quantify cardiac amyloid deposition and relative perfusion, respectively, in amyloidosis patients and healthy controls. We recommend a dual-phase scan: 0.5-5 min and 50-60 min p.i. as the appropriate time window for clinically assessing cardiac amyloidosis and perfusion measurements using18F-Florbetapir PET.

TITLE: Parametric Mapping for TSPO PET Imaging with Spectral Analysis Impulsive Response Function

AUTHORS: Mattia Veronese, Marcello Tuosto, Tiago Reis Marques, Oliver Howes, Belen Pascual, Meixiang Yu, Joseph C Masdeu, Federico Turkheimer, Alessandra Bertoldo, Paolo Zanotti-Fregonara

JOURNAL: Molecular imaging and biology

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: The aim of this study was to investigate the use of spectral analysis (SA) for voxel-wise analysis of TSPO PET imaging studies. TSPO PET quantification is methodologically complicated by the heterogeneity of TSPO expression and its cell-dependent modulation during neuroinflammatory response. Compartmental models to account for this complexity exist, but they are unreliable at the high noise typical of voxel data. On the contrary, SA is noise-robust for parametric mapping and provides useful information about tracer kinetics with a free compartmental structure.

Procedures: SA impulse response function (IRF) calculated at 90 min after tracer injection was used as main parameter of interest in 3 independent PET imaging studies to investigate its sensitivity to (1) a TSPO genetic polymorphism (rs6971) known to affect tracer binding in a cross-sectional analysis of healthy controls scanned with [11C]PBR28 PET; (2) TSPO density with [11C]PBR28 in a competitive blocking study with a TSPO blocker, XBD173; and (3) the higher affinity of a second radiotracer for TSPO, by using data from a head-to-head comparison between [11C]PBR28 and [11C]ER176 scans.

Results: SA-IRF produced parametric maps of visually good quality. These were sensitive to TSPO genotype (mean relative difference between high- and mixed-affinity binders = 25 %) and TSPO availability (mean signal displacement after 90 mg oral administration of XBD173 = 39 %). Regional averages of voxel-wise IRF estimates were strongly associated with regional total distribution volume (VT) estimated with a 2-tissue compartmental model with vascular compartment (Pearson's r = 0.86 ± 0.11) but less strongly with standard 2TCM-VT(Pearson's r = 0.76 ± 0.32). Finally, SA-IRF estimates for [11C]ER176 were significantly higher than [11C]PBR28 ones, consistent with the higher amount of specific binding of the former tracer.

Conclusions: SA-IRF can be used for voxel-wise quantification of TSPO PET data because it generates high-quality parametric maps, it is sensitive to TSPO availability and genotype, and it accounts for the complexity of TSPO tracer kinetics with no additional assumptions.

JOURNAL: Molecular imaging and biology

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) signaling plays a pivotal role in neuroinflammation, driving microglia proliferation and activation. CSF1R is considered a hallmark of inflammation in many neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Our study aims to evaluate the potential value of 5-cyano-N-(4-(4-(2-([18F]fluoro)ethyl)piperazin-1-yl)-2-(piperidin-1-yl)phenyl)furan-2-carboxamide ([18F]JNJ-CSF1R-1) as a positron emission tomography (PET) ligand targeting CSF1R in preclinical models of neuroinflammation.

Procedures: A cell-based MSD assay was used to measure the IC50of 5-cyano-N-(4-(4-(2-(fluoro)ethyl)piperazin-1-yl)-2-(piperidin-1-yl)phenyl)furan-2-carboxamide (JNJ-CSF1R-1). JNJ-CSF1R-1 was radiolabeled with fluorine-18. PET imaging was used to evaluate brain uptake, and target engagement of [18F]JNJ-CSF1R-1 in two neuroinflammation mouse models, including systemic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and AppSAAknock in (KI). CSF1R protein levels in brain tissue were determined by western blot and ELISA assays. [18F]JNJ-CSF1R-1 brain uptake was also measured in a non-human primate (NHP) PET study.

Results: JNJ-CSF1R-1 is a 12 nM (IC50) inhibitor of CSF1R. ​[18F]JNJ-CSF1R-1 demonstrated significantly higher brain uptake in both LPS and AD mouse models as measured by the area under the time activity curves (AUC) compared to control animals. In the AppSAAKI model, CSF1R levels increased near amyloid plaques as detected by IHC. ​[18F]JNJ-CSF1R-1 PET imaging signal showed a good correlation with CSF1R expression levels measured by western blot and ELISA. In an NHP study, ​[18F]JNJ-CSF1R-1 readily entered the brain and demonstrated reversible kinetics.

Conclusion: ​[18F]JNJ-CSF1R-1 is a potent and promising CSF1R PET tracer with translational potential for measuring microglia-based neuroinflammatory processes and for tracking the impact of anti-inflammatory therapies.

TITLE: Microplastics: A major source of phthalate esters in aquatic environments

AUTHORS: Yaru Cao, Huiju Lin, Kai Zhang, Shaopeng Xu, Meng Yan, Kenneth M Y Leung, Paul K S Lam

JOURNAL: Journal of hazardous materials

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Phthalate esters (PAEs) are predominant additives in plastics, their widespread contamination in aquatic environments has raised global concern. Here, twelve plastic products were prepared as microplastics to investigate their release behaviors of PAEs. Six out of 15 PAEs were quantified after 14 days of incubation in water. The leaching potentials were plastic type-specific, where the pencil case (polyvinyl chloride, PVC) represented the highest migrations with total ∑15PAEs concentration of 6660 ± 513 ng/g, followed by the cleaning brush-1 (polyamide, PA, ~1830 ng/g) and rubber glove (1390 ± 57.5 ng/g). Conversely, the straw (polypropylene, PP), cleaning brush-2 (polyethylene terephthalate, PET) and shampoo bottle (PET) released the lowest amounts of PAEs, with 50.3 ± 8.21, 93.9 ± 91.8 and 104.35 ng/g, respectively. The release patterns of PAE congeners were polymer type-related, where di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP) dominated the leaching from PA, PP and PET microplastics (47-84%), diethyl phthalate leached the most from PVC and rubber microplastics (45-92%), while diisobutyl phthalate and DBP dominated the leaching from PE microplastics (68-94%). Water chemical properties could affect PAEs migration and the kinetic leaching process was well fitted with the pseudo-first-order model. Approximately 57.8-16,100 kg/year of PAEs were estimated to be released into oceans from microplastics.

JOURNAL: Nuclear medicine and biology

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
The role of mitochondrial complex I (MC-I) dysfunction is well-documented across a range of neurodegenerative disorders. Recently, a novel positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand, [18F]CNL02, has been synthesized to target MC-I. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive characterization of [18F]CNL02, using nonhuman primate as a model system. In the brain of a rhesus macaque, [18F]CNL02 demonstrated specific binding in regions expressing MC-I. All observed brain regions showed rapid kinetic profiles. Analysis of arterial plasma indicated a swift clearance of [18F]CNL02 from the bloodstream. Metabolite analysis identified two predominant radiometabolites in the plasma. The regional brain time-activity curves (TACs) for [18F]CNL02 were effectively characterized through a two-tissue compartment model (2TCM). Furthermore, the total distribution volume was reliably estimated employing the Logan plot method. Consequently, continued development and refinement of [18F]CNL02 are imperative.

JOURNAL: EJNMMI research

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Background: Monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) is a key serine hydrolase which terminates endocannabinoid signaling and regulates arachidonic acid driven inflammatory responses within the central nervous system. To develop [11C]PF-06809247 into a clinically usable MAGL positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand, we assessed the occupancy of MAGL by an inhibitor in the non-human primate (NHP) brain. Additionally, we measured the whole-body distribution of [11C]PF-06809247 in NHP and estimated human effective radiation doses.

Methods: Seven cynomolgus monkeys were enrolled for brain PET measurements. Two PET measurements along with arterial blood sampling were performed in each NHP: one baseline and one pretreatment condition with intravenous administration of PF-06818883, a pro-drug of a selective MAGL inhibitor (total of seven doses between 0.01 and 1.27 mg/kg). Kinetic parameters K1, k2and k3were estimated by a two tissue compartment (2TC) model using metabolite corrected plasma radioactivity as the input function. k4was set as 0 according to the irreversible binding of [11C]PF-06809247. Kiby 2TC and Patlak analysis were calculated as the influx constant. The target occupancy was calculated using Kiat baseline and pretreatment conditions. Two cynomolgus monkeys were enrolled for whole-body PET measurements. Estimates of the absorbed radiation dose in humans were calculated with OLINDA/EXM 1.1 using the adult male reference model.

Results: Radioactivity retention was decreased in all brain regions following pretreatment with PF-06818883. Occupancy was measured as 25.4-100.5% in a dose dependent manner. Whole-body PET showed high radioactivity uptake values in the liver, small intestine, kidney, and brain. The effective dose of [11C]PF-06809247 was calculated as 4.3 μSv/MBq.

Conclusions: [11C]PF-06809247 is a promising PET ligand for further studies of MAGL in the human brain.

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Assessment of liver function is essential before partial hepatectomy to predict the risk of post hepatectomy liver failure, a severe and life-threatening complication. Traditional methods have focused on expected future liver remnant (FLR) volume estimation. However, liver volume does not always correlate with function. We suggest that metabolism might be a better surrogate for function than volume. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the metabolic changes in a porcine model of partial portal vein ligation (PVL) using hyperpolarized magnetic resonance imaging (HP-MRI). Specifically, we sought to quantify and compare the pyruvate metabolism in the FLR and the deportalized liver (DL).Six pigs underwent PVL. HP-MRI with [1-13C] pyruvate was performed at baseline, post-surgery, and 1 week after surgery. Metabolic conversion was quantified with kinetic modelling of the rate constants of pyruvate to lactate (kPL) and pyruvate to alanine (kPA). Mean kPLwas increased in FLR compared to DL at post-surgery and 1 week after surgery (P = 0.002), while kPAwas unaltered (P = 0.761). These findings indicate a metabolic shift towards glycolysis in the FLR. This non-invasive metabolic imaging technique could serve as a powerful tool for evaluation of regional liver function prior to partial hepatectomy and consequently improve patient outcomes.

ABSTRACT:
Background: Despite advances in breast cancer imaging, reliable detection of sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastasis remains challenging. This study aimed to determine the ability of immuno-positron emission tomography (PET) using64Cu-labeled cetuximab to detect SLN metastasis in a model of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-positive breast cancer.

Methods: The SLN metastasis model was established using the EGFR-strongly-expressing MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cell line. In this xenograft model, [64Cu]Cu-PCTA-cetuximab was administered intravenously (5.8 ± 0.9 MBq; n = 12) or both intradermally and subdermally into the parapapillary region of the tumor-containing mammary gland (4.3 ± 0.4 MBq; n = 11), after which PET was performed.18F-FDG PET was also performed intravenously (9.1 ± 1.4 MBq; n = 4) or intradermally/subdermally (5.4 ± 2.2 MBq; n = 3) in the same cohort before [64Cu]Cu-PCTA-cetuximab PET. PET/computed tomography was performed 60 min after administration of18F-FDG and 24 h after administration of [64Cu]Cu-PCTA-cetuximab. Delayed PET/CT scans were conducted 48 h after administration for all mice in the intradermally/subdermally administered [64Cu]Cu-PCTA-cetuximab group and for four of the 12 mice in the intravenously administered [64Cu]Cu-PCTA-cetuximab group. SLNs were identified using blue dye, and PET and pathological evaluations of the resected SLN were performed to confirm metastases.

Results: After intravenous administration of [64Cu]Cu-PCTA-cetuximab (n = 12), accumulation was detected in the primary tumor in all mice and in the axilla of eight mice (67%, SUVmax1.24 ± 0.51), all of which were found to have SLNs with histologically confirmed metastasis. The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and negative and positive predictive values for PET with intravenously administered [64Cu]Cu-PCTA-cetuximab were 89%, 100%, 92%, 75%, and 100%, respectively. In contrast, all mice with intradermal/subdermal administration (n = 11) showed high accumulation in both the primary tumor and axillary lymph nodes (SUVmax4.28 ± 1.19), with six mice (55%, SUVmax5.01 ± 1.12) having histologically confirmed metastasis. The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and positive predictive values for PET with intradermally/subdermally administered [64Cu]Cu-PCTA-cetuximab were 100%, 0%, 55% and 55%, respectively. SLN metastasis was not detectable by intravenous or intradermal/subdermal18F-FDG PET.

Conclusions: PET with intravenously administered [64Cu]Cu-PCTA-cetuximab demonstrated high precision for diagnosis of SLN metastasis in a xenograft model of EGFR-positive human breast cancer. Although further evaluation is necessary, intradermal/subdermal administration could be a useful therapeutic approach owing to its high accumulation in SLNs.

TITLE: Upcycling Waste PET: I. Ammonolysis Kinetics of Model Dimethyl Terephthalate and the Catalytic Effects of Ethylene Glycol

AUTHORS: Richard-Joseph L Peterson, Elanna P Neppel, Lars Peereboom, P Anh Trinh, Robert Y Ofoli, John R Dorgan

JOURNAL: ACS sustainable chemistry & engineering

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Chemical upcycling of waste plastics can play an important role in developing greater circularity in the material flows associated with the plastics industries. In this study, a fundamental understanding of upcycling poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) using ammonolysis is established. First, rate constants are determined for model studies of the ammonolysis of dimethyl terephthalate (DMT) in methanol. Ammonolysis proceeds sequentially, and a first ester group of DMT reacts with ammonia to produce methanol and the monoamide methyl 4-carbamoylbenzoate (MCB). Next, MCB reacts with ammonia to yield methanol and terephthalamide (TPD). At 100 °C, the pseudo first order rate constants arek1'= 0.25 ± 0.02 h-1andk2'= 0.11 ± 0.02 h-1. Experiments conducted at 50, 75, 100, and 125 °C yield activation energies for the first and second reactions ofE= 27.9 ± 2.2 kJ/mol andE= 37.3 ± 3.3 kJ/mol. Ammonolysis is demonstrated to be catalyzed by ethylene glycol (EG) with a first order concentration dependence. At 100 °C with EG present in a 3:1 excess, the pseudo first order rate constants arek3'= 6.3 ± 0.7 h-1andk4'= 1.7 ± 0.3 h-1, representing a 22-fold increase. Demonstration experiments with reclaimed mixed postconsumer thermoform containers reveal that the ammonolysis of PET is self-catalyzed by the generated EG; the upcycling reaction on polymer substrates is autocatalytic. This new detailed understanding of the self-catalyzed chemical kinetics of ammonolysis suggests EG as the natural choice for the solvent, a topic pursued in part II of this work.

TITLE: Cardiorenal ketone metabolism in healthy humans assessed by 11C-acetoacetate PET: effect of D-β-hydroxybutyrate, a meal, and age

AUTHORS: Valérie St-Pierre, Gabriel Richard, Etienne Croteau, Mélanie Fortier, Camille Vandenberghe, André C Carpentier, Bernard Cuenoud, Stephen C Cunnane

JOURNAL: Frontiers in physiology

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
The heart and kidney have a high energy requirement, but relatively little is known about their utilization of ketones as a potential energy source. We assessed the metabolism of the ketone tracer, carbon-11 acetoacetate (11C-AcAc), by the left and right ventricles of the heart and by the kidney using positron emission tomography (PET) in n = 10 healthy adults under four experimental conditions: a 4-h fast (fasted) ± a single 12 g oral dose of D-beta-hydroxybutyrate (D-BHB), and a single complete, liquid replacement meal (hereafter referred to as the "fed" condition) ± a single 12 g oral dose of D-BHB. Under these experimental conditions, the kinetics of11C-AcAc metabolism fitted a two-compartment model in the heart and a three-compartment model in the kidney. Plasma ketones were about 10-fold higher with the oral dose of D-BHB. During the four conditions, tracer kinetics were broadly similar in the myocardium and kidney cortex.11C-AcAc metabolism by the kidney pelvis was similar in three of the four study conditions but, later, peaked significantly higher than that in the cortex; the exception was that the tracer uptake was significantly lower in the fed condition without D-BHB.11C-AcAc uptake was significantly inversely correlated with age in the kidney cortex, and its oxidative metabolism was significantly positively correlated with age in the left ventricle. D-BHB blunted the insulin, gastric inhibitory peptide, and C-peptide response to the meal. This PET methodology and these acute metabolic perturbations would be suitable for future studies assessing cardiorenal ketone metabolism in conditions in which heart and kidney functions are experimentally modified or compromised by disease.

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a 4-repeat tauopathy movement disorder that can be imaged by the18F-labeled tau PET tracer 2-(2-([18F]fluoro)pyridin-4-yl)-9H-pyrrolo[2,3-b:4,5-c']dipyridine (18F-PI-2620). The in vivo diagnosis is currently established on clinical grounds and supported by midbrain atrophy estimation in structural MRI. Here, we investigate whether18F-PI-2620 tau PET has the potential to improve the imaging diagnosis of PSP.Methods:In this multicenter observational study, dynamic (0-60 min after injection)18F-PI-2620 PET and structural MRI data for 36 patients with PSP, 22 with PSP-Richardson syndrome, and 14 with a clinical phenotype other than Richardson syndrome (i.e., variant PSP) were analyzed along with data for 10 age-matched healthy controls (HCs). The PET data underwent kinetic modeling, which resulted in distribution volume ratio (DVR) images. These and the MR images were visually assessed by 3 masked experts for typical PSP signs. Furthermore, established midbrain atrophy parameters were measured in structural MR images, and regional DVRs were measured in typical tau-in-PSP target regions in the PET data.Results:Visual assessments discriminated PSP patients and HCs with an accuracy of 63% for MRI and 80% for the combination of MRI and18F-PI-2620 PET. As compared with patients of the PSP-Richardson syndrome subgroup, those of the variant PSP subgroup profited more in terms of sensitivity from the addition of the visual18F-PI-2620 PET to the visual MRI information (35% vs. 22%). In quantitative image evaluation, midbrain-to-pons area ratio and globus pallidus DVRs discriminated best between the PSP patients and HCs, with sensitivities and specificities of 83% and 90%, respectively, for MRI and 94% and 100%, respectively, for the combination of MRI and18F-PI-2620 PET. The gain of sensitivity by adding18F-PI-2620 PET to MRI data was more marked in clinically less affected patients than in more affected patients (37% vs. 19% for visual, and 16% vs. 12% for quantitative image evaluation).Conclusion:These results provide evidence for an improved imaging-based PSP diagnosis by adding18F-PI-2620 tau PET to structural MRI. This approach seems to be particularly promising at earlier disease stages and could be of value both for improving early clinical PSP diagnosis and for enriching PSP cohorts for trials of disease-modifying drugs.

TITLE: Imaging joint infections using D-methyl-11C-methionine PET/MRI: initial experience in humans

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Non-invasive imaging is a key clinical tool for detection and treatment monitoring of infections. Existing clinical imaging techniques are frequently unable to distinguish infection from tumors or sterile inflammation. This challenge is well-illustrated by prosthetic joint infections that often complicate joint replacements. D-methyl-11C-methionine (D-11C-Met) is a new bacteria-specific PET radiotracer, based on an amino acid D-enantiomer, that is rapidly incorporated into the bacterial cell wall. In this manuscript, we describe the biodistribution, radiation dosimetry, and initial human experience using D-11C-Met in patients with suspected prosthetic joint infections.

Methods: 614.5 ± 100.2 MBq of D-11C-Met was synthesized using an automated in-loop radiosynthesis method and administered to six healthy volunteers and five patients with suspected prosthetic joint infection, who were studied by PET/MRI. Time-activity curves were used to calculate residence times for each source organ. Absorbed doses to each organ and body effective doses were calculated using OLINDA/EXM 1.1 with both ICRP 60 and ICRP 103 tissue weighting factors. SUVmaxand SUVpeakwere calculated for volumes of interest (VOIs) in joints with suspected infection, the unaffected contralateral joint, blood pool, and soft tissue background. A two-tissue compartment model was used for kinetic modeling.

Results: D-11C-Met was well tolerated in all subjects. The tracer showed clearance from both urinary (rapid) and hepatobiliary (slow) pathways as well as low effective doses. Moreover, minimal background was observed in both organs with resident micro-flora and target organs, such as the spine and musculoskeletal system. Additionally, D-11C-Met showed increased focal uptake in areas of suspected infection, demonstrated by a significantly higher SUVmaxand SUVpeakcalculated from VOIs of joints with suspected infections compared to the contralateral joints, blood pool, and background (P < 0.01). Furthermore, higher distribution volume and binding potential were observed in suspected infections compared to the unaffected joints.

Conclusion: D-11C-Met has a favorable radiation profile, minimal background uptake, and fast urinary extraction. Furthermore, D-11C-Met showed increased uptake in areas of suspected infection, making this a promising approach. Validation in larger clinical trials with a rigorous gold standard is still required.

TITLE: Investigate the influence of microplastics weathering on their heavy metals uptake in stormwater

AUTHORS: Khashayar Aghilinasrollahabadi, Maryam Salehi, Tomoko Fujiwara

JOURNAL: Journal of hazardous materials

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Plastic debris as the main portion of urban litters could be transported via storm runoff to the water resources. In this study the influence of microplastics (MPs) weathering on their Pb2+and Zn2+uptake in stormwater was examined. Low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) MPs were subjected to weathering through mechanical interaction with a mixture of silt/sand, and in synthetic stormwater. The surface analysis revealed significant physio-chemistry alterations of LDPE MPs due to the silt/sand weathering. However, this weathering mostly resulted in the surface morphology alterations of PET MPs. The kinetics of heavy metals adsorptions onto the new and stormwater weathered LDPE MPs were best described by pseudo 1st and 2nd models, respectively. Despite increasing Pb2+uptake by weathered PET MPs, Zn2+uptake by both new and weathered PET MPs was below the detection limit. Both Pb2+and Zn2+were released from new and silt/sand weathered LDPE MPs during five days exposure to the synthetic stormwater. This study underscores the critical role of plastic type and weathering conditions on heavy metal transport by MPs from the urban environment to the water resources.

TITLE: From Waste to Worth: Innovative Pyrolysis of Textile Waste into Microporous Carbons for Enhanced Environmental Sustainability

AUTHORS: Anastasia Anceschi, Francesco Trotta, Marina Zoccola, Fabrizio Caldera, Giuliana Magnacca, Alessia Patrucco

JOURNAL: Polymers

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
The generation of synthetic textile waste is a growing global concern, with an unsustainable rate of expansion. This study addresses the growing issue of synthetic textile waste by converting polyester-polyurethane (PET-PU) post-industrial scraps into microporous carbon materials, which can be utilized for wastewater treatment. Using a straightforward pyrolysis process, we achieved a high specific surface area (632 m2/g) and narrow porosity range (2-10 Å) without requiring chemical activation. The produced carbon materials effectively adsorbed methylene blue and orange II dyes, with maximum adsorption capacities of 169.49 mg/g and 147.56 mg/g, respectively. Kinetic studies demonstrated that adsorption followed a pseudo-second-order model, indicating strong interactions between the adsorbent and dyes. Regeneration tests showed that the C-PET-PU could be reused for multiple cycles with over 85% retention of its original adsorption capacity. Preliminary life cycle assessment (LCA) and life cycle cost (LCC) analysis highlighted the environmental and economic advantages of this upcycling approach, showing a reduced global warming potential and a production cost of approximately 1.65 EUR/kg. These findings suggest that transforming PET-PU waste into valuable adsorbents provides a sustainable solution for the circular economy and highlights the potential for broader applications in environmental remediation.

TITLE: Total-body PET/CT - First Clinical Experiences and Future Perspectives

AUTHORS: Quinn Kwan-Tai Ng, Elizabeth Katherine Anna Triumbari, Negar Omidvari, Simon R Cherry, Ramsey D Badawi, Lorenzo Nardo

JOURNAL: Seminars in nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Total-body PET has come a long way from its first conception to today, with both total-body and long axial field of view (> 1m) scanners now being commercially available world-wide. The conspicuous signal collection efficiency gain, coupled with high spatial resolution, allows for higher sensitivity and improved lesion detection, enhancing several clinical applications not readily available on current conventional PET/CT scanners. This technology can provide (a) reduction in acquisition times with preservation of diagnostic quality images, benefitting specific clinical situations (i.e. pediatric patients) and the use of several existing radiotracers that present transient uptake over time and where small differences in acquisition time can greatly impact interpretation of images; (b) reduction in administered activity with minimal impact on image noise, thus reducing effective dose to the patient, improving staff safety, and helping with logistical concerns for short-lived radionuclides or long-lived radionuclides with poor dosimetry profiles that have had limited use on conventional PET scanners until now; (c) delayed scanning, that has shown to increase the detection of even small and previously occult malignant lesions by improved clearance in regions of significant background activity and by reduced visibility of coexisting inflammatory processes; (d) improvement in image quality, as a consequence of higher spatial resolution and sensitivity of total-body scanners, implying better appreciation of small structures and clinical implications with downstream prognostic consequences for patients; (e) simultaneous total-body dynamic imaging, that allows the measurement of full spatiotemporal distribution of radiotracers, kinetic modeling, and creation of multiparametric images, providing physiologic and biologically relevant data of the entire body at the same time. On the other hand, the higher physical and clinical sensitivity of total-body scanners bring along some limitations and challenges. The strong impact on clinical sensitivity potentially increases the number of false positive findings if the radiologist does not recalibrate interpretation considering the new technique. Delayed scanning causes logistical issues and introduces new interpretation questions for radiologists. Data storage capacity, longer processing and reconstruction time issues are other limitations, but they may be overcome in the near future by advancements in reconstruction algorithms and computing hardware.

TITLE: A Pilot Study of Dynamic 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT Imaging of Prostate Adenocarcinoma in High-Risk Primary Prostate Cancer Patients

AUTHORS: Michelle Lu, Liza Lindenberg, Esther Mena, Baris Turkbey, Jurgen Seidel, Anita Ton, Yolanda McKinney, Philip Eclarinal, Maria Merino, Peter Pinto, Peter Choyke, Stephen Adler

JOURNAL: Molecular imaging and biology

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: The primary aim of this study was to investigate the pharmacokinetics of18F-DCFPyL, an18F-labeled PSMA-based ligand, and to explore the utility of early time point positron emission tomography (PET) imaging extracted from PET data to distinguish malignant primary prostate from benign prostate tissue.

Procedures: Ten consecutive patients with biopsy-proven high-risk prostate cancer underwent a dynamic18F-DCFPyL PET/CT scan of the pelvis for the first 45 min post-injection (p.i.) followed by a static PET/CT at 2 h p.i.18F-DCFPyL uptake values and kinetics were compared between benign prostate tissue and prostate cancer, including quantitative pharmacokinetic PET parameters extracted from18F-DCFPyL time activity curves generated from dynamic data using a two-tissue compartment model and Patlak plots.

Results: 18F-DCFPyL uptake values were significantly higher in primary prostate tumors than those in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and normal prostate tissue at 5 min, 30 min, and 120 min p.i. (P = 0.0002), when examining both SUVmaxand SUVmeanvalues. The two-tissue compartment model found an overall influx value (Ki) of 0.063 in primary prostate cancer, demonstrating a Kiover 15-fold higher in malignant prostate tissue compared with BPH (Ki= 0.004) and normal prostate tissue (Ki= 0.005) (P = 0.0001).

Conclusion: High-risk primary prostate cancer is readily identified on dynamic and static, delayed,18F-DCFPyL PET images. The tumor-to-background ratio increases over time, with optimal18F-DCFPyL PET/CT imaging at 120 min p.i. for evaluation of prostate cancer, but not necessarily ideal for clinical application. Primary prostate cancer demonstrates different uptake kinetics in comparison to BPH and normal prostate tissue. The 15-fold difference in Kibetween prostate cancer and non-cancer (BPH and normal) tissues translates to an ability to distinguish prostate cancer from normal tissue at time points as early as 5 to 10 min p.i.

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear cardiology : official publication of the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Introduction: The purpose of this study was to evaluate subjects with high-risk alcohol cardiotoxicity and patients with alcoholic cardiomyopathy (ACM) via dynamic11C-Acetate positron emission tomography (PET) imaging as a myocardial oxidative metabolic probe.

Methods and results: We recruited 37 subjects with chronic alcohol consumption [18 with moderate consumption (MC), 19 with heavy consumption (HC)], 5 ACM patients, and 12 healthy controls to receive dynamic11C-Acetate PET scans. PET imaging data were analyzed to calculate kinetic parameters (e.g., Kmono, K1and k2) based on the mono-exponential and one-tissue compartmental models. Myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO2) and myocardial external efficiency (MEE) were then derived from these kinetic parameters. MVO2was significantly lowered in the HC group and in ACM patients (0.121± 0.018 and 0.111 ± 0.017 mL·g-1·min-1, respectively) compared with those in healthy controls and MC subjects (0.144 ± 0.023 and 0.146 ± 0.027 mL·g-1·min-1, respectively; P < .01). MEE was significantly reduced in ACM patients (13.0% ± 4.3%) compared with those of healthy controls (22.4% ± 4.6%, P < .01), MC subjects (20.1% ± 4.5%, P < .05), and HC subjects (22.3% ± 4.5%, P < .001).

Conclusion: Functional assessment via dynamic11C-Acetate PET imaging may represent a clinically feasible probe for identifying cohorts with high-risk cardiotoxicity due to addictive alcohol consumption and ACM.

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Background: This study aimed to develop a novel positron emission tomography (PET) tracer, [68Ga]Ga-TD-01, for CXCR4 imaging. To achieve this goal, the molecular scaffold of TIQ15 was tuned by conjugation with the DOTA chelator to make it suitable for68Ga radiolabeling.

Methods: A bifunctional chelator was prepared by conjugating the amine group of TIQ15 with p-NCS-Bz-DOTA, yielding TD-01, with a high yield (68.92%). TD-01 was then radiolabeled with68Ga using 0.1 M ammonium acetate at 60 °C for 10 min. A 1-h dynamic small animal PET/MRI study of the labeled compound in GL261-luc2 tumor-bearing mice was performed, and brain tumor uptake was assessed. Blocking studies involved pre-administration of TIQ15 (10 mg/kg) 10 min before the PET procedure started.

Results: [68Ga]Ga-TD-01 exhibited a radiochemical yield (RCY) of 36.33 ± 1.50% (EOS), with a radiochemical purity > 99% and a molar activity of 55.79 ± 1.96 GBq/µmol (EOS). The radiotracer showed in vitro stability in PBS and human plasma for over 4 h. Biodistribution studies in healthy animals revealed favorable kinetics for subsequent PET pharmacokinetic modeling with low uptake in the brain and moderate uptake in lungs, intestines and spleen. Elimination could be assigned to a renal-hepatic pathway as showed by high uptake in kidneys, liver, and urinary bladder. Importantly, [68Ga]Ga-TD-01 uptake in glioblastoma (GBM)-bearing mice significantly decreased upon competition with TIQ15, with a baseline tumor-to-background ratios > 2.5 (20 min p.i.), indicating high specificity.

Conclusion: The newly developed CXCR4 PET tracer, [68Ga]Ga-TD-01, exhibited a high binding inhibition for CXCR4, excellent in vitro stability, and favorable pharmacokinetics, suggesting that the compound is a promising candidate for full in vivo characterization of CXCR4 expression in GBM, with potential for further development as a tool in cancer diagnosis.

TITLE: Advancements, challenges, and future prospects in clinical hyperpolarized magnetic resonance imaging: A comprehensive review

AUTHORS: Ching-Yi Hsieh, Ying-Chieh Lai, Kuan-Ying Lu, Gigin Lin

JOURNAL: Biomedical journal

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Hyperpolarized (HP) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a groundbreaking imaging platform advancing from research to clinical practice, offering new possibilities for real-time, non-invasive metabolic imaging. This review explores the latest advancements, challenges, and future directions of HP MRI, emphasizing its transformative impact on both translational research and clinical applications. By employing techniques such as dissolution Dynamic Nuclear Polarization (dDNP), Parahydrogen-Induced Polarization (PHIP), Signal Amplification by Reversible Exchange (SABRE), and Spin-Exchange Optical Pumping (SEOP), HP MRI achieves enhanced nuclear spin polarization, enabling in vivo visualization of metabolic pathways with exceptional sensitivity. Current challenges, such as limited imaging windows, complex pre-scan protocols, and data processing difficulties, are addressed through innovative solutions like advanced pulse sequences, bolus tracking, and kinetic modeling. We highlight the evolution of HP MRI technology, focusing on its potential to revolutionize disease diagnosis and monitoring by revealing metabolic processes beyond the reach of conventional MRI and positron emission tomography (PET). Key advancements include the development of novel tracers like [2-13C]pyruvate and [1-13C]-alpha-ketoglutarate and improved data analysis techniques, broadening the scope of clinical metabolic imaging. Future prospects emphasize integrating artificial intelligence, standardizing imaging protocols, and developing new hyperpolarized agents to enhance reproducibility and expand clinical capabilities particularly in oncology, cardiology, and neurology. Ultimately, we envisioned HP MRI as a standardized modality for dynamic metabolic imaging in clinical practice.

ABSTRACT:
Radiopharmaceutical therapy is a rapidly growing field for the treatment of cancer due to its high specificity and ability to target individual affected cells. A key component of the pre-clinical development of a new therapeutic radiopharmaceutical is the determination of its time-dependent distribution in tumors, normal tissues, and the whole body in mouse tumor models. Here, we provide an overview of the available instrumentation for the novice in radiation measurement. We also detail the methodology for assessing distribution and kinetics of a radiopharmaceutical and calculating radiation absorbed dose in mice using a gamma counter or a PET or SPECT camera.

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear cardiology : official publication of the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Background: Cardiac sympathetic nervous system molecular imaging has demonstrated prognostic value. Compared with meta-[11C]hydroxyephedrine, [18F]flubrobenguane (FBBG) facilitates reliable estimation of SNS innervation using similar analytical methods and possesses a more convenient physical half-life. The aim of this study was to evaluate pharmacokinetic and metabolic properties of FBBG in target clinical cohorts.

Methods: Blood sampling was performed on 20 participants concurrent to FBBG PET imaging (healthy = NORM, non-ischemic cardiomyopathy = NICM, ischemic cardiomyopathy = ICM, post-traumatic stress disorder = PTSD). Image-derived blood time-activity curves were transformed to plasma input functions using cohort-specific corrections for plasma protein binding, plasma-to-whole blood distribution, and metabolism.

Results: The plasma-to-whole blood ratio was 0.78 ± 0.06 for NORM, 0.64 ± 0.06 for PTSD and 0.60 ± 0.14 for (N)ICM after 20 minutes. 22 ± 4% of FBBG was bound to plasma proteins. Metabolism of FBBG in (N)ICM was delayed, with a parent fraction of 0.71 ± 0.05 at 10 minutes post-injection compared to 0.53 ± 0.03 for PTSD/NORM. While there were variations in metabolic rate, metabolite-corrected plasma input functions were similar across all cohorts.

Conclusions: Rapid plasma clearance of FBBG limits the impact of disease-specific corrections of the blood input function for tracer kinetic modeling.

ABSTRACT:
Irradiated waste high-density polyethylene@Zn/ionic liquid novel composite well-fabricated via coacervation method was irradiated by gamma-irradiation and studied the effect of that radiation on the desulfurization process. The prepared composites were characterized by various analytical techniques as follows: X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-Transform infrared (FT-IR), X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS), scanning electron microscope (SEM), High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM), N2-adsorption-desorption isotherm, and thermal gravimetric analysis (TG/DTA). The adsorptive desulfurization process of benzothiophene (BT) and dibenzothiophene (DBT) which are harmful compounds in diesel model fuel was investigating using the irradiated and unirradiated composite. The results illustrated that the unirradiated and irradiated composites exhibit an adequate adsorption capacity reached (50-75 mg S/g) and (60-85 mg S/g) for BT and DBT, respectively. The adsorption process over the prepared adsorbents follows the pseudo-second-order kinetic models. The irradiated composite exhibited more adsorption capacity than the unirradiated one due to the radiation generated more surface area and created proton-bond donor sites in the composite surface, which increases the interaction between the surface and sulfur species. The adsorption capacity and adsorption percentage for irradiated and unirradiated composites towards (SCCs) were studied using response surface methodology based on the central composite design (CCD). The thermodynamic factors (∆H°, ∆G°, and ∆S°) reveal that these processes are endothermic adsorption processes. The irradiated PEt @Zn/IL was re-used without significant loss of adsorption activity. This novel irradiated PEt @Zn/IL is the first time used as an adsorbent with an advantage that includes its excellent adsorption capacity, which ensures the product will be efficient in a real process such as the petrochemical industry.

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Positron emission tomography (PET) provides precise molecular information on physiological processes, but its low temporal resolution is a major obstacle. Consequently, we characterized the metabolic response of the human brain to working memory performance using an optimized functional PET (fPET) framework at a temporal resolution of 3 s.

Methods: Thirty-five healthy volunteers underwent fPET with [18F]FDG bolus plus constant infusion, 19 of those at a hybrid PET/MRI scanner. During the scan, an n-back working memory paradigm was completed. fPET data were reconstructed to 3 s temporal resolution and processed with a novel sliding window filter to increase signal to noise ratio. BOLD fMRI signals were acquired at 2 s.

Results: Consistent with simulated kinetic modeling, we observed a constant increase in the [18F]FDG signal during task execution, followed by a rapid return to baseline after stimulation ceased. These task-specific changes were robustly observed in brain regions involved in working memory processing. The simultaneous acquisition of BOLD fMRI revealed that the temporal coupling between hemodynamic and metabolic signals in the primary motor cortex was related to individual behavioral performance during working memory. Furthermore, task-induced BOLD deactivations in the posteromedial default mode network were accompanied by distinct temporal patterns in glucose metabolism, which were dependent on the metabolic demands of the corresponding task-positive networks.

Conclusions: In sum, the proposed approach enables the advancement from parallel to truly synchronized investigation of metabolic and hemodynamic responses during cognitive processing. This allows to capture unique information in the temporal domain, which is not accessible to conventional PET imaging.

JOURNAL: Annals of nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Background and objective: In neuroinflammation, activated astrocytes, called reactive astrocytes, highly express monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B). [18F]SMBT-1 is a novel PET tracer developed for imaging neuroinflammation, with highly selective binding to MAO-B. The quantification method for [18F]SMBT-1 PET imaging has not been established, although some human studies using [18F]SMBT-1 PET imaging have already been conducted. In this study, we explored the most appropriate method for quantifying [18F]SMBT-1 PET.

Methods: Dynamic PET scanning of [18F]SMBT-1, accompanied by serial arterial blood sampling, was performed in healthy elderly subjects. With PET and blood data, the total distribution volumes (Vts) in the brain regions were calculated using a one-tissue compartment model (1TCM), a two-tissue compartment model (2TCM), and Logan graphical analysis. Standardized uptake values (SUVs) and SUV ratio-1 (SUVR-1) were determined for different time frames and reference regions.

Results: The values of the χ2criterion and Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) in the brain regions were lower in 2TCM than in 1TCM, suggesting that 2TCM was a better model in terms of curve fitting. However, the very high coefficient of variation (%COV) for parameters such as K1, k2, k3, and k4 in 2TCM suggests that these parameters may not have been properly estimated. SUVs, especially at 50-70 and 70-90 min post-injection, were strongly correlated with Vt (r = 0.9188-0.9445, p < 0.0001). SUVR-1 at these time points, referenced to various regions, showed significant correlations with MAO-B distribution in the brain shown in a previous postmortem study (r = 0.9362-0.9399, p < 0.0001).

Conclusions: These findings suggest that SUVR-1, especially at 50-70 min and 70-90 min post-injection, reflects MAO-B distribution and is useful for quantifying [18F]SMBT-1 PET imaging, potentially enabling noninvasive assessment of neuroinflammation in the brain.

TITLE: Ecologically sustainable removal of pharmaceuticals: A mechanistic study of bismuth sulfide-graphene oxide/silver nanocomposite

AUTHORS: M Banupriya, A Manimekalai, M Umadevi, R Parimaladevi, Suresh Sagadevan

JOURNAL: Environmental research

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Bismuth sulfide nanoparticles (BiS NPs) were synthesized via the hydrothermal method, and reduced graphene oxide(rGO) and silver nanoparticles (Ag), which acted as substrates, have prepared using the chemical reduction method. The synthesized nanoparticles have been characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, and photoluminescence spectroscopy. Commercially available paracetamol-500 mg (PAM) and aspirin-300 mg (ASP) were selected for photodegradation under visible light using the as-prepared composites in an aqueous solution. Photoluminescence spectroscopy was used to detect PAM and ASP using the photo-excited electron transfer (PET) process, and the limit of detection (LOD) has obtained for PAM(8.70 ppm) and ASP(4.43 ppm) with a sensitivity of 0.9954 and 0.8002, respectively. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was used to analyze the before and after degradation products and to confirm the disintegrated products such as -COOH and -CH- both before and after disintegration.. The experimental data were found to fit well with the Freundlich isotherm, suggesting that the as-prepared nanocomposites exhibited a heterogeneous nature for PAM (5119 mg/L), and the pseudo-first-order kinetic model suggests ASP (1030 mg/L) with R2values of 0.9119 and 0.7075. The risk assessment analysis of PAM was 9.823 μg/L(RQ > 1) and that of ASP was 0.2106 μg/L(RQ < 1), indicating that PAM has a higher potential risk than ASP. The demographic data of the participants indicated that PAM was the most stockpiled medicine at home; this work also encompasses the action of a single PAM and ASP tablet toward the environment, if it is accidently disposed of improperly could create massive water/soil pollution; hence, the care/duty of each person should follow the proper disposal of medical waste because we cannot replace this environment.

TITLE: Valorization of waste polyethylene terephthalate plastic into N-doped microporous carbon for CO2 capture through a one-pot synthesis

AUTHORS: Xiangzhou Yuan, Shuangjun Li, Sunbin Jeon, Shuai Deng, Li Zhao, Ki Bong Lee

JOURNAL: Journal of hazardous materials

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Valorization of waste polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic into microporous carbon with N-doping treatment was successfully performed in a one-pot synthesis and the N-doped microporous carbon was used for CO2capture, which can mitigate plastic pollution and climate change simultaneously. The PET-derived microporous carbon developed by KOH activation and urea treatment in a one-pot synthesis at 700 °C exhibited the highest CO2adsorption uptake of 6.23 mmol g-1at 0 °C and 4.58 mmol g-1at 25 °C (1 atm). The Langmuir and pseudo second-order models displayed well-fitting relationships with equilibrium and kinetic experimental data obtained in this study. The N-doped microporous carbon showed high CO2selectivity over N2, implying that it is feasible for treating flue gases (10% CO2and 90% N2) at 50 °C. In addition, the CO2uptake was not only affected by micropores but also related with nitrogen and oxygen functional groups. Compared to the porous carbon prepared by two-pot synthesis where KOH activation and urea treatment were conducted separately, the porous carbon prepared by one-pot synthesis had higher oxygen contents and higher CO2adsorption uptake. All of findings implied that the N-doped microporous carbon was successfully developed from waste PET plastic for capturing CO2and can play a promising role in both sustainable waste management and environmental protection.

TITLE: Low temperature and facile synthesis of nitrogen-doped hierarchical porous carbon derived from waste polyethylene terephthalate for efficient CO2 capture

AUTHORS: Shaojie Zhou, Haiyang Xu, Shurong Wang, Hongyu Feng, Yanjun Hu, Shicheng Zhang

JOURNAL: The Science of the total environment

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Waste polyethylene terephthalate (PET) with high carbon content (>60 wt%) has shown great potential in the field of synthesizing carbon materials for CO2capture, attracting increasing attention. Herein, an innovative strategy was proposed to synthesize nitrogen-doped hierarchical porous carbon (PC) for CO2capture using PET as precursor and sodium amide (NaNH2) as both nitrogen dopant and low-temperature activator. As-synthesized N-doped PC exhibited a significantly high micropore volume of 0.755 cm3/g and a rich content of N- and O-containing functional groups, offering ample active sites for CO2molecules. Further, the adsorbents demonstrated excellent CO2capture capacity, achieving 5.7 mmol/g (0 °C) and 3.3 mmol/g (25 °C) at 1 bar, respectively. This was primarily attributed to the synergistic effect of narrow micropores filling and electrostatic interactions. Moreover, as-synthesized PC exhibited rapid CO2adsorption capability, and its dynamic adsorption process was effectively described using a pseudo-second-order kinetic model. After five consecutive cycles, PET-derived PC still maintained ~100 % of adsorption capacity. They also possessed good CO2/N2selectivity and reasonable isosteric heat of adsorption. Therefore, as-synthesized nitrogen-doped PC is a promising CO2adsorbent through low-temperature activation of carbonized PET with NaNH2. Such findings have substantial implications for waste plastic recycling and mitigating the greenhouse effect.

ABSTRACT:
Simultaneous characterization of pathologies by multi-tracer positron emission tomography (PET) is among the most promising applications in nuclear medicine. Aim of this work was the simultaneous production of two PET-tracers in one module and test the relevance for human application. [11C]harmine and [11C]DASB were concurrently synthesized in a 'two-in-one-pot' reaction in quality for application. Dual-tracer protocol was simulated using 16 single PET scans in different orders of tracer application separated by different time intervals. Volume of distribution was calculated for single- and dual-tracer measurements using Logan's plot and arterial input function in 13 brain regions. The 'two-in-one-pot' reaction yielded equivalent amounts of both radiotracers with comparable molar activities. The simulations of the dual-tracer application were comparable to the single bolus injections in 13 brain regions, when [11C]harmine was applied first and [11C]DASB second, with an injection time interval of 45 min (rxy= 0.90). Our study shows the successful simultaneous dual-tracer production leading to decreased radiation burden and costs. The simulation of dual subject injection to quantify the monoamine oxidase-A and serotonin transporter distribution proved its high potential. Multi-tracer imaging may drive more sophisticated study designs and diminish the day-to-day differences in the same individual as well as increase PET scanner efficiency.

TITLE: Characterization of Properties and Kinetic Analysis of Unsaturated Polyester Resin Synthesized from PET Alcoholysis Waste

AUTHORS: Ruixiang Wang, Hongliang Zhang, Jingshuang Liu, Tongjun Wei

JOURNAL: Polymers

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Recycling and reutilization of waste PET through alcoholysis has been a prominent focus of current research. However, the alcoholysis process is reversible, leading to the generation of oligomeric waste byproducts. To further utilize these wastes, this paper processed oligomeric waste derived from various alcoholysis systems to synthesize unsaturated polyester resins (UPRs). The fundamental characteristics, mechanical properties, and curing processes of synthesized UPRs were analyzed based on GPC, FTIR, TG, tensile testing, DMA, and DSC tests. The results indicate that wastes were successfully synthesized to UPRs. The UPRs synthesized from ethylene glycol (EG) and diethylene glycol (DEG) possess more complex compositions; among these, the UPR synthesized from EG exhibited higher thermal stability, whereas the UPR synthesized from DEG showed a broader molecular weight distribution and a lower glass transition temperature (). In addition, the UPR synthesized from DEG exhibited a remarkably high elongation at break (>180%), potentially attributed to its long molecular chains. Regarding curing characteristics, UPRs obtained from DEG and propylene glycol (PG) exhibited slower curing rates and demanded higher activation energies. Moreover, the curing processes of UPRs could be well described by the Sesták-Berggren autocatalytic model.

JOURNAL: Journal of translational medicine

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Background: Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging with Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA) and Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) represent promising biomarkers for risk-stratification of Prostate Cancer (PCa). We verified whether the expression of genes encoding for PSMA and enzymes regulating FDG cellular uptake are independent and additive prognosticators in PCa.

Methods: mRNA expression of genes involved in glucose metabolism and PSMA regulation obtained from primary PCa specimens were retrieved from open-source databases and analyzed using an integrative bioinformatics approach. Machine Learning (ML) techniques were used to create predictive Progression-Free Survival (PFS) models. Cellular models of primary PCa with different aggressiveness were used to compare [18F]F-PSMA-1007 and [18F]F-FDG uptake kinetics in vitro. Confocal microscopy, immunofluorescence staining, and quantification analyses were performed to assess the intracellular and cellular membrane PSMA expression.

Results: ML analyses identified a predictive functional network involving four glucose metabolism-related genes: ALDOB, CTH, PARP2, and SLC2A4. By contrast, FOLH1 expression (encoding for PSMA) did not provide any additive predictive value to the model. At a cellular level, the increase in proliferation rate and migratory potential by primary PCa cells was associated with enhanced FDG uptake and decreased PSMA retention (paralleled by the preferential intracellular localization).

Conclusions: The overexpression of a functional network involving four glucose metabolism-related genes identifies a higher risk of disease progression since the earliest phases of PCa, in agreement with the acknowledged prognostic value of FDG PET imaging. By contrast, the prognostic value of PSMA PET imaging is independent of the expression of its encoding gene FOLH1. Instead, it is influenced by the protein docking to the cell membrane, regulating its accessibility to tracer binding.

TITLE: Direct parametric reconstruction in dynamic PET using deep image prior and a novel parameter magnification strategy

AUTHORS: Xiaotong Hong, Fanghu Wang, Hao Sun, Hossein Arabi, Lijun Lu

JOURNAL: Computers in biology and medicine

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Background/purpose: Multiple parametric imaging in positron emission tomography (PET) is challenging due to the noisy dynamic data and the complex mapping to kinetic parameters. Although methods like direct parametric reconstruction have been proposed to improve the image quality, limitations persist, particularly for nonlinear and small-value micro-parameters (e.g., k2, k3). This study presents a novel unsupervised deep learning approach to reconstruct and improve the quality of these micro-parameters.

Methods: We proposed a direct parametric image reconstruction model, DIP-PM, integrating deep image prior (DIP) with a parameter magnification (PM) strategy. The model employs a U-Net generator to predict multiple parametric images using a CT image prior, with each output channel subsequently magnified by a factor to adjust the intensity. The model was optimized with a log-likelihood loss computed between the measured projection data and forward projected data. Two tracer datasets were simulated for evaluation:82Rb data using the 1-tissue compartment (1 TC) model and18F-FDG data using the 2-tissue compartment (2 TC) model, with 10-fold magnification applied to the 1 TC k2and the 2 TC k3, respectively. DIP-PM was compared to the indirect method, direct algorithm (OTEM) and the DIP method without parameter magnification (DIP-only). Performance was assessed on phantom data using peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) and structural similarity index (SSIM), as well as on real18F-FDG scan from a male subject.

Results: For the 1 TC model, OTEM performed well in K1reconstruction, but both indirect and OTEM methods showed high noise and poor performance in k2. The DIP-only method suppressed noise in k2, but failed to reconstruct fine structures in the myocardium. DIP-PM outperformed other methods with well-preserved detailed structures, particularly in k2, achieving the best metrics (PSNR: 19.00, NRMSE: 0.3002, SSIM: 0.9289). For the 2 TC model, traditional methods exhibited high noise and blurred structures in estimating all nonlinear parameters (K1, k2, k3), while DIP-based methods significantly improved image quality. DIP-PM outperformed all methods in k3(PSNR: 21.89, NRMSE: 0.4054, SSIM: 0.8797), and consequently produced the most accurate 2 TC Kiimages (PSNR: 22.74, NRMSE: 0.4897, SSIM: 0.8391). On real FDG data, DIP-PM also showed evident advantages in estimating K1, k2and k3while preserving myocardial structures.

Conclusions: The results underscore the efficacy of the DIP-based direct parametric imaging in generating and improving quality of PET parametric images. This study suggests that the proposed DIP-PM method with the parameter magnification strategy can enhance the fidelity of nonlinear micro-parameter images.

TITLE: Conversion of PET Bottle Waste into a Terephthalic Acid-Based Metal-Organic Framework for Removing Plastic Nanoparticles from Water

AUTHORS: Chingakham Chinglenthoiba, Gomathi Mahadevan, Jiawei Zuo, Thiruchelvam Prathyumnan, Suresh Valiyaveettil

JOURNAL: Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Micro- and nanoparticles of plastic waste are considered emerging pollutants with significant environmental and health impacts at high concentrations or prolonged exposure time. Here we report the synthesis and characterization of a known metal-organic framework (MOF) using terephthalic acid (TPA) recovered from the hydrolysis of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottle waste. This approach adds value to the existing large amounts of bottle waste in the environment. Fully characterized zinc-TPA MOF (MOF-5) was used for the extraction and removal of engineered polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) nanoparticles from water with a high efficiency of 97% and 95%, respectively. Kinetic and isotherm models for the adsorption of polymer nanoparticles (PNPs) on the MOF surface were investigated to understand the mechanism. The Qmax for PVC and PMMA NPs were recorded as 56.65 mg/g and 33.32 mg/g, respectively. MOF-5 was characterized before and after adsorption of PNPs on the surface of MOF-5 using a range of techniques. After adsorption, the MOF-5 was successfully regenerated and reused for the adsorption and removal of PNPs, showing consistent results for five adsorption cycles with a removal rate of 83-85%. MOF-5 was characterized before and after adsorption of PNPs on the surface using a range of techniques. The MOF-5 with PNPs on the surface was successfully regenerated and reused for the adsorption and removal of polymer nanoparticles, showing consistent results for five extraction cycles. As a proof of concept, MOF-5 was also used to remove plastic particles from commercially available body scrub gel solutions. Such methods and materials are needed to mitigate the health hazards caused by emerging micro- and nanoplastic pollutants in the environment.

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Background: Total-body (TB) Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is one of the most promising medical diagnostics modalities, opening new perspectives for personalized medicine, low-dose imaging, multi-organ dynamic imaging or kinetic modeling. The high sensitivity provided by total-body technology can be advantageous for novel tomography methods like positronium imaging, demanding the registration of triple coincidences. Currently, state-of-the-art PET scanners use inorganic scintillators. However, the high acquisition cost reduces the accessibility of TB PET technology. Several efforts are ongoing to mitigate this problem. Among the alternatives, the Jagiellonian PET (J-PET) technology, based on axially arranged plastic scintillator strips, offers a low-cost alternative solution for TB PET.

Purpose: The work aimed to compare five total-body J-PET geometries with plastic scintillators suitable for multi-organ and positronium tomography as a possible next-generation J-PET scanner design.

Methods: We present comparative studies of performance characteristics of the cost-effective total-body PET scanners using J-PET technology. We investigated in silico five TB scanner geometries, varying the number of rings, scanner radii, and other parameters. Monte Carlo simulations of the anthropomorphic XCAT phantom, the extended 2-m sensitivity line source and positronium sensitivity phantoms were used to assess the performance of the geometries. Two hot spheres were placed in the lungs and in the liver of the XCAT phantom to mimic the pathological changes. We compared the sensitivity profiles and performed quantitative analysis of the reconstructed images by using quality metrics such as contrast recovery coefficient, background variability and root mean squared error. The studies are complemented by the determination of sensitivity for the positronium lifetime tomography and the relative cost analysis of the studied setups.

Results: The analysis of the reconstructed XCAT images reveals the superiority of the seven-ring scanners over the three-ring setups. However, the three-ring scanners would be approximately 2-3 times cheaper. The peak sensitivity values for two-gamma vary from 20 to 34 cps/kBq and are dominated by the differences in geometrical acceptance of the scanners. The sensitivity curves for the positronium tomography have a similar shape to the two-gamma sensitivity profiles. The peak values are lower compared to the two-gamma cases, from about 20-28 times, with a maximum value of 1.66 cps/kBq. This can be contrasted with the 50-cm one-layer J-PET modular scanner used to perform the first in-vivo positronium imaging with a sensitivity of 0.06 cps/kBq.

Conclusions: The results show the feasibility of multi-organ imaging of all the systems to be considered for the next generation of TB J-PET designs. Among the scanner parameters, the most important ones are related to the axial field-of-view coverage. The two-gamma sensitivity and XCAT image reconstruction analyzes show the advantage of seven-ring scanners. However, the cost of the scintillator materials and SiPMs is more than two times higher for the longer modalities compared to the three-ring solutions. Nevertheless, the relative cost for all the scanners is about 10-4 times lower compared to the cost of the uExplorer. These properties coupled together with J-PET cost-effectiveness and triggerless acquisition mode enabling three-gamma positronium imaging, make the J-PET technology an attractive solution for broad application in clinics.

ABSTRACT:
Fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) is widely used for the detection, diagnosis, and clinical decision-making in oncological diseases. However, in daily medical practice, it is often difficult to make clinical decisions because of physiological FDG uptake or cancers with poor FDG uptake. False negative clinical diagnoses of malignant lesions are critical issues that require attention. In this study, Vision Transformer (ViT) was used to automatically classify18F-FDG PET/CT slices as benign or malignant. This retrospective study included18F-FDG PET/CT data of 207 (143 malignant and 64 benign) patients from a medical institute to train and test our models. The ViT model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.90 [95% CI 0.89, 0.91], which was superior to the baseline Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models (EfficientNet, 0.87 [95% CI 0.86, 0.88], P < 0.001; DenseNet, 0.87 [95% CI 0.86, 0.88], P < 0.001). Even when FDG uptake was low, ViT produced an AUC of 0.81 [95% CI 0.77, 0.85], which was higher than that of the CNN (DenseNet, 0.65 [95% CI 0.59, 0.70], P < 0.001). We demonstrated the clinical value of ViT by showing its sensitive analysis of easy-to-miss cases of oncological diseases.

TITLE: Water Vapor Sorption and Diffusivity in Bio-Based Poly(Ethylene Vanillate)-PEV

AUTHORS: Greta Giacobazzi, Claudio Gioia, Micaela Vannini, Paola Marchese, Valérie Guillard, Hélène Angellier-Coussy, Annamaria Celli

JOURNAL: Polymers

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
The dynamic and equilibrium water vapor sorption properties of amorphous and highly crystalline poly(ethylene vanillate) (PEV) films were determined via gravimetric analysis, at 20 °C, over a wide range of relative humidity (0-95% RH). At low RH%, the dynamic of the sorption process obeys Fick's law while at higher relative humidity it is characterized by a drift ascribable to non-Fickian relaxations. The non-Fickian relaxations, which are responsible for the incorporation of additional water, are correlated with the upturn of the sorption isotherms and simultaneously the hysteresis recorded between sorption and desorption cycles. The sorption isotherms of amorphous and highly crystalline PEV are arranged in the same concentration range of that of PET proving the similarity of the two polyesters. Water diffusion coefficients, whose determination from individual kinetic sorption/desorption curves required treatment with the Barens-Hopfenberg model, were demonstrated to be ≈ 10× higher for amorphous PEV compared to amorphous PET. Such a difference originates from the enhanced segmental flexibility of PEV chains.

ABSTRACT:
Purpose:The density of the neuronal dopamine transporter (DAT) is directly correlated with the presynaptic dopaminergic system injury. In a first study, we evaluated the brain distribution and kinetics of [18F]LBT-999, a DAT PET radioligand, in a group of eight healthy subjects. Taking into account the results obtained in healthy volunteers, we wanted to evaluate whether the loss of presynaptic striatal dopaminergic fibers could be estimated, under routine clinical conditions, using [18F]LBT-999 and a short PET acquisition.Materials and methods:Six patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) were compared with eight controls. Eighty-nine minutes of dynamic PET following an intravenous injection of [18F]LBT-999 were acquired. Using regions of interest for striatal nuclei, substantia nigra (SN), cerebellum, and occipital cortex, defined over each T1 3D MRI, time-activity curves (TACs) were obtained. From TACs, binding potential (BPND) using the simplified reference tissue model and distribution volume ratios (DVRs) using Logan graphical analysis were calculated. Ratios obtained for a 10-min image, acquired between 30 and 40 min post-injection, were also calculated. Cerebellum activity was used as non-specific reference region.Results:In PD patients and as expected, striatal uptake was lower than in controls which is confirmed by BPND, DVR, and ratios calculated for both striatal nuclei and SN, significantly inferior in PD patients compared with controls (p< 0.001).Conclusions:PET with [18F]LBT-999 could be an alternative to assess dopaminergic presynaptic injury in a clinical environment using a single 10 min acquisition.

TITLE: Evaluation of (rac)-, (R)-, and (S)-18F-OF-NB1 for Imaging GluN2B Subunit-Containing N-Methyl-d-Aspartate Receptors in Nonhuman Primates

ABSTRACT:
Despite 2 decades of research, noN-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor (GluN) subtype 2B (GluN1/2B) radioligand is yet clinically validated. Previously, we reported on (rac)-18F-OF-NB1 as a promising GluN1/2B PET probe in rodents and its successful application for the visualization of GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors in postmortem brain tissues of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In the current work, we report on thein vivocharacterization of (rac)-, (R)-, and (S)-18F-OF-NB1 in nonhuman primates.Methods:PET scans were performed on rhesus monkeys. Plasma profiling was used to obtain the arterial input function. Regional brain time-activity curves were generated and fitted with the 1- and 2-tissue-compartment models and the multilinear analysis 1 method, and the corresponding regional volumes of distribution were calculated. Blocking studies with the GluN1/2B ligand Co 101244 (0.25 mg/kg) were performed for the enantiopure radiotracers. Receptor occupancy, nonspecific volume of distribution, and regional binding potential (BPND) were obtained. Potential off-target binding toward σ1receptors was assessed for (S)-18F-OF-NB1 using the σ1receptor ligand FTC-146.Results:Free plasma fraction was moderate, ranging from 12% to 16%. All radiotracers showed high and heterogeneous brain uptake, with the highest levels in the cortex. (R)-18F-OF-NB1 showed the highest uptake and slowest washout kinetics of all tracers. The 1-tissue-compartment model and multilinear analysis 1 method fitted the regional time-activity curves well for all tracers and produced reliable regional volumes of distribution, which were higher for (R)- than (S)-18F-OF-NB1. Receptor occupancy by Co 101244 was 85% and 96% for (S)-18F-OF-NB1 and (R)-18F-OF-NB1, respectively. Pretreatment with FTC-146 at both a low (0.027 mg/kg) and high (0.125 mg/kg) dose led to a similar reduction (48% and 49%, respectively) in specific binding of (S)-18F-OF-NB1. Further, pretreatment with both Co 101244 and FTC-146 did not result in a further reduction in specific binding compared with Co 101244 alone in the same monkey (82% vs. 81%, respectively). RegionalBPNDvalues ranged from 1.3 in the semiovale to 3.4 in the cingulate cortex for (S)-18F-OF-NB1.Conclusion:Both (R)- and (S)-18F-OF-NB1 exhibited high binding specificity to GluN2B subunit-containing NMDA receptors. The fast washout kinetics, good regionalBPNDvalues, and high plasma free fraction render (S)-18F-OF-NB1 an attractive radiotracer for clinical translation.

JOURNAL: EJNMMI research

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Background: In the development of new18F-labelled tracers, it is important to assess the amount of released [18F]fluoride taken up in the bones of experimental animals because all18F-labelled PET-tracers are prone, to lesser or higher degree, to undergo defluorination, with subsequent release of [18F]fluoride during scanning. However, the pharmacokinetics of [18F]fluoride in bones and other organs of healthy rats have not been well documented in a comprehensive manner. We aimed to study pharmacokinetics of [18F]NaF in rats in order to increase our understanding of the biodistribution of [18F]fluoride originating from defluorination of18F-labelled tracers. We studied [18F]fluoride uptake in Sprague Dawley rat bones, including the epiphyseal parts of the tibia and radius, the mandible, ilium, lumbar vertebrae, costochondral joints, tibia, radius, and ribs, with 60-min in vivo PET/CT imaging. Kinetic parameters, K1, Ki, Ki/K1, and k3were calculated with a three-compartment model. In addition, separate groups of male and female rats were studied with ex vivo bone and soft tissue harvesting and gamma counting over a 6-h period.

Results: [18F]fluoride perfusion and uptake varied among the different bones. [18F]fluoride uptake was higher in trabecular bones, due to high perfusion and osteoblastic activity, compared to cortical bones. In soft tissues, the organ-to-blood uptake ratios increased over time in the eyes, lungs, brain, testes, and ovaries during the 6 h study period.

Conclusion: Understanding the pharmacokinetics of [18F]fluoride in various bones and soft tissues is highly useful for assessing18F-labelled radiotracers that release [18F]fluoride.

TITLE: MicroPET Imaging Assessment of Brain Tau and Amyloid Deposition in 6 × Tg Alzheimer's Disease Model Mice

AUTHORS: ShinWoo Kang, Jinho Kim, Sang-Yoon Lee, Nobuyuki Okamura, Keun-A Chang

JOURNAL: International journal of molecular sciences

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the deposition of extracellular amyloid plaques and intracellular accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFT). Amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau imaging are widely used for diagnosing and monitoring AD in clinical settings. We evaluated the pathology of a recently developed 6 × Tg - AD (6 × Tg) mouse model by crossbreeding 5 × FAD mice with mice expressing mutant (P301L) tau protein using micro-positron emission tomography (PET) image analysis. PET studies were performed in these 6 × Tg mice using [18F]Flutemetamol, which is an amyloid PET radiotracer; [18F]THK5351 and [18F]MK6240, which are tau PET radiotracers; moreover, [18F]DPA714, which is a translocator protein (TSPO) radiotracer, and comparisons were made with age-matched mice of their respective parental strains. We compared group differences in standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR), kinetic parameters, biodistribution, and histopathology. [18F]Flutemetamol images showed prominent cortical uptake and matched well with 6E10 staining images from 2-month-old 6 × Tg mice. [18F]Flutemetamol images showed a significant correlation with [18F]DPA714 in the cortex and hippocampus. [18F]THK5351 images revealed prominent hippocampal uptake and matched well with AT8 immunostaining images in 4-month-old 6 × Tg mice. Moreover, [18F]THK5351 images were confirmed using [18F]MK6240, which revealed significant correlations in the cortex and hippocampus. Uptake of [18F]THK5351 or [18F]MK6240 was highly correlated with [18F]Flutemetamol in 4-month-old 6 × Tg mice. In conclusion, PET imaging revealed significant age-related uptake of Aβ, tau, and TSPO in 6 × Tg mice, which was highly correlated with age-dependent pathology.

TITLE: Amphetamine pretreatment blunts dopamine-induced D2/D3-receptor occupancy by an arrestin-mediated mechanism: A PET study in internalization compromised mice

AUTHORS: Joseph B Mandeville, Jonah Weigand-Whittier, Hsiao-Ying Wey, Yin-Ching I Chen

JOURNAL: NeuroImage

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
While all reversible receptor-targeting radioligands for positron emission tomography (PET) can be displaced by competition with an antagonist at the receptor, many radiotracers show limited occupancies using agonists even at high doses. [11C]Raclopride, a D2/D3 receptor radiotracer with rapid kinetics, can identify the direction of changes in the neurotransmitter dopamine, but quantitative interpretation of the relationship between dopamine levels and radiotracer binding has proven elusive. Agonist-induced receptor desensitization and internalization, a homeostatic mechanism to downregulate neurotransmitter-mediated function, can shift radioligand-receptor binding affinity and confound PET interpretations of receptor occupancy. In this study, we compared occupancies induced by amphetamine (AMP) in drug-naive wild-type (WT) and internalization-compromised β-arrestin-2 knockout (KO) mice using a within-scan drug infusion to modulate the kinetics of [11C]raclopride. We additionally performed studies at 3 h following AMP pretreatment, with the hypothesis that receptor internalization should markedly attenuate occupancy on the second challenge, because dopamine cannot access internalized receptors. Without prior AMP treatment, WT mice exhibited somewhat larger binding potential than KO mice but similar AMP-induced occupancy. At 3 h after AMP treatment, WT mice exhibited binding potentials that were 15 % lower than KO mice. At this time point, occupancy was preserved in KO mice but suppressed by 60 % in WT animals, consistent with a model in which most receptors contributing to binding potential in WT animals were not functional. These results demonstrate that arrestin-mediated receptor desensitization and internalization produce large effects in PET [11C]raclopride occupancy studies using agonist challenges.

TITLE: Recent advancements in personalized management of prostate cancer biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy

AUTHORS: Fabian Falkenbach, Jonas Ekrutt, Tobias Maurer

JOURNAL: Current opinion in urology

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Purpose of review: Biochemical recurrence (BCR) after radical prostatectomy exhibits heterogeneous prognostic implications. Recent advancements in imaging and biomarkers have high potential for personalizing care.

Recent findings: Prostate-specific membrane antigen imaging (PSMA)-PET/CT has revolutionized the BCR management in prostate cancer by detecting microscopic lesions earlier than conventional staging, leading to improved cancer control outcomes and changes in treatment plans in approximately two-thirds of cases. Salvage radiotherapy, often combined with androgen deprivation therapy, remains the standard treatment for high-risk BCR postprostatectomy, with PSMA-PET/CT guiding treatment adjustments, such as the radiation field, and improving progression-free survival. Advancements in biomarkers, genomic classifiers, and artificial intelligence-based models have enhanced risk stratification and personalized treatment planning, resulting in both treatment intensification and de-escalation.

Summary: While conventional risk grouping relying on Gleason score and PSA level and kinetics remain the foundation for BCR management, PSMA-PET/CT, novel biomarkers, and artificial intelligence may enable more personalized treatment strategies.

ABSTRACT:
Microglia, the immune cells in the brain, play a significant role in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases. To visualize these cells in the living brain, we developed a PET ligand, [11C]NCGG401 (4-{2-[((1R,2R)-2-hydroxycyclohexyl)(methyl)amino]benzothiazol-6-yloxy}-N-methylpicolinamide, NCGG401), that targets colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R). In this study, we present the first-in-human evaluation of [11C]NCGG401 to assess its safety profile and then to evaluate its kinetics to quantify CSF1R in the human brain.Methods:Head to upper thigh PET scans were conducted in 3 healthy men to estimate the effective dose of [11C]NCGG401. Brain PET scans were performed on 6 healthy men, combined with arterial blood sampling and metabolite analyses. Compartmental and graphical models were used to quantify CSF1R in the human brain. [11C]NCGG401 PET data were indirectly compared with regional CSF1R protein levels after death that were reported in a proteomics study. In addition, the results of this study were directly compared with the PET imaging of 18-kDa translocator protein using [11C]DPA-713 (N,N-diethyl-2-[2-(4-methoxyphenyl)-5,7-dimethylpyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidin-3-yl]acetamide, DPA-713).Results:The administration of [11C]NCGG401 did not result in severe adverse events. The effective doses per injected activity were 5.1 ± 0.2 µSv/MBq for men and 6.1 ± 0.3 µSv/MBq for women. [11C]NCGG401 demonstrated good brain permeability, with peak uptake reaching an SUV of 3. Regional total distribution volumes were reliably quantified using the 2-tissue compartment model and a Logan plot with 60 min of scan data. The resulting parametric images reflected the known distribution of CSF1R in the brain. Furthermore, regional total distribution volume values of [11C]NCGG401 showed good correlation with regional CSF1R protein levels. The [11C]NCGG401 images showed regional distributions different from those of [11C]DPA-713.Conclusion:[11C]NCGG401 images appear to reflect regional microglia-specific distributions of CSF1R in the brain, consistent with the findings of a CSF1R proteomics study by others. However, ultimate confirmation of specific CSF1R binding should be validated by evaluating, in suitable preclinical or human experiments, pharmacologic blockade of its binding in the brain in vivo.

TITLE: Efficient radiolabeling of mesoporous silica nanoparticles for single-cell PET imaging

AUTHORS: Syamantak Khan, Xiaoxu Zhong, Neeladrisingha Das, Jung Ho Yu, Arutselvan Natarajan, David Anders, Guillem Pratx

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Nanoparticles are highly efficient vectors for ferrying contrast agents across cell membranes, enabling ultra-sensitive in vivo tracking of single cells with positron emission tomography (PET). However, this approach must be fully characterized and understood before it can be reliably implemented for routine applications.

Methods: We developed a Langmuir adsorption model that accurately describes the process of labeling mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNP) with68Ga. We compared the binding efficiency of three different nanoparticle systems by fitting the model to experimental data. We then chose the MSNP with the highest affinity for68Ga to study uptake and efflux kinetics in cancer cells. After intracardiac injection of 50-100 cells in mice, PET imaging was performed to test the effectiveness of cellular radiolabeling.

Results: We found that highly porous mesoporous nanoparticles (d = 100 nm) with MCM-41 pore structures can achieve radiolabeling efficiency > 30 GBq/mg using68Ga, without the need for any chelator. These68Ga conjugated particles showed strong serum stability in vitro. In mice, the68Ga-MSNPs predominantly accumulated in the liver with a high signal-to-background ratio and no bladder signal, indicating excellent stability of the labeled nanoparticles in vivo. Additionally, these MSNPs were efficiently taken up by B16F10 and MDA-MB-231 cancer cells, as confirmed by confocal imaging, flow cytometry analysis, and gamma counting. Finally, cardiac injection of < 10068Ga-MSNP-labeled cells allowed PET/CT tracking of these cells in various organs in mice.

Conclusion: We characterized the critical parameters of MSNP-mediated direct cellular radiolabeling to improve the use of these nanoparticles as cellular labels for highly sensitive preclinical PET imaging.

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Beta-secretase 1 (BACE1) enzyme is implicated in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease. [18F]PF-06684511 is a positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand for imaging BACE1. Despite favorable brain kinetic properties, the effective dose (ED) of [18F]PF-06684511 estimated in non-human primates was relatively high. This study was therefore designed to evaluate the whole-body distribution, dosimetry, quantification, and test-retest reliability of imaging brain BACE1 with [18F]PF-06684511 in healthy volunteers.

Methods: Five subjects were studied for the dosimetry study. Whole-body PET was performed for 366 min with 4 PET-CT sessions. Estimates of the absorbed radiation dose were calculated using the male adult model. Eight subjects participated in the test-retest study. Brain PET measurements were conducted for 123 min with an interval of 5 to 19 days between test and retest conditions. The total distribution volume (VT) was estimated with one-tissue (1T), two-tissue (2T), compartment model (CM), and graphical analysis. Test-retest variability (TRV) and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of VTwere calculated as reliability measures.

Results: In the dosimetry study, the highest uptake was found in the liver (25.2 ± 2.3 %ID at 0.5 h) and the largest dose was observed in the pancreas (92.9 ± 52.2 μSv/MBq). The calculated ED was 24.7 ± 0.8 μSv/MBq. In the test-retest study, 2TCM described the time-activity curves well. VT(2TCM) was the highest in the anterior cingulate cortex (6.28 ± 1.09 and 6.85 ± 0.81) and the lowest in the cerebellum (4.23 ± 0.88 and 4.20 ± 0.75). Mean TRV and ICC of VT(2TCM) were 16.5% (12.4-20.5%) and 0.496 (0.291-0.644).

Conclusion: The ED of [18F]PF-06684511 was similar to other18F radioligands, allowing repeated PET measurements. 2TCM was the most appropriate quantification method. TRV of VTwas similar to other radioligands without a reference region, albeit with lower ICC. These data indicated that [18F]PF-06684511 is a suitable radioligand to measure BACE1 level in the human brain.

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
The use of reporter genes to non-invasively image molecular processes inside cells has significant translational potential, particularly in the context of systemically administered gene therapy vectors and adoptively administered cells such as immune or stem cell based therapies. Bacterial nitroreductase enzymes possess ideal properties for reporter gene imaging applications, being of non-human origin and possessing the ability to metabolize a range of clinically relevant nitro(hetero)cyclic substrates.Methods:A library of elevenEscherichia colinitroreductase candidates were screened for the ability to efficiently metabolize 2-nitroimidazole based positron emission tomography (PET) probes originally developed as radiotracers for hypoxic cell imaging. Several complementary methods were utilized to detect formation of cell-entrapped metabolites, including variousin vitroandin vivomodels to establish the capacity of the 2-nitroimidazole PET agent EF5 to quantify expression of a nitroreductase candidate. Proof-of-principle PET imaging studies were successfully conducted using18F-HX4.Results:Recombinant enzyme kinetics, bacterial SOS reporter assays, anti-proliferative assays and flow cytometry approaches collectively identified the major oxygen-insensitive nitroreductase NfsA fromE. coli(NfsA_Ec) as the most promising nitroreductase reporter gene. Cells expressing NfsA_Ec were demonstrably labelled with the imaging agent EF5 in a manner that was quantitatively superior to hypoxia, in monolayers (2D), multicellular layers (3D), and in human tumor xenograft models. EF5 retention correlated with NfsA_Ec positive cell density over a range of EF5 concentrations in 3Din vitromodels and in xenograftsin vivoand was predictive ofin vivoanti-tumor activity of the cytotoxic prodrug PR-104. Following PET imaging with18F-HX4, a significantly higher tumor-to-blood ratio was observed in two xenograft models for NfsA_Ec expressing tumors compared to the parental tumors thereof, providing verification of this reporter gene imaging approach.Conclusion:This study establishes that the bacterial nitroreductase NfsA_Ec can be utilized as an imaging capable reporter gene, with the ability to metabolize and trap 2-nitroimidazole PET imaging agents for non-invasive imaging of gene expression.

TITLE: Effects of Biofilms on Trace Metal Adsorption on Plastics in Freshwater Systems

AUTHORS: Zhilin Liu, Tanveer M Adyel, Zhiyuan Wang, Jun Wu, Jianchao Liu, Lingzhan Miao, Jun Hou

JOURNAL: International journal of environmental research and public health

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
The formation of plastisphere on plastics and their potential impact on freshwater ecosystems have drawn increasing attention. However, there is still limited information about the effects of plastisphere on the heavy metal adsorption capacity and the related mechanism of plastic debris in different freshwaters. Herein, the trace metal adsorption capacity, kinetics and adsorption mechanisms of virgin and biofilm-covered plastic debris were investigated. Polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic debris were placed in three freshwaters (Xuanwu Lake, Donghu Lake and the Qinhuai River) for 45 days to incubate biofilms. Batch adsorption experiments were performed to compare the adsorption processes of trace metal on virgin and biofilm-covered plastics. Results showed that biofilms increase the adsorption of metals on plastics, and the adsorption isotherms were well fitted by the Langmuir model. Furthermore, the adsorption capacities for lead (Pb(II)) were higher than that of cadmium (Cd(II)) and zinc (Zn(II)), with 256.21 and 277.38 μg/g (Pb(II)) adsorbed in biofilm-covered PP and PET, respectively, in Xuanwu Lake. The adsorption kinetics of metals on plastic debris were significantly affected by the biofilms, by switching the intraparticle diffusion for virgin plastic debris to film diffusion for the biofilm-covered plastic debris. Moreover, the complexation of functional groups within the biofilms might mainly contribute to the increases of metal adsorption, involving the participation of oxygen and nitrogen groups. Overall, these results suggested that biofilms reinforce the potential role of plastics as a carrier of trace metals in freshwaters.

JOURNAL: Polymers

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
This work describes the preparation of a molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) platform on polyethylene terephthalate (MIP-PET) via RAFT polymerization for analyzing tartrazine using a smartphone. The MIP-PET platform was characterized using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) techniques, Raman Spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and confocal microscopy. The optimal pH and adsorption time conditions were determined. The adsorption capacity of the MIP-PET plates with RAFT treatment (0.057 mg cm-2) was higher than that of the untreated plates (0.028 mg cm-2). The kinetic study revealed a pseudo-first-order model with intraparticle diffusion, while the isotherm study indicated a fit for the Freundlich model. Additionally, the MIP-PET demonstrated durability by maintaining its adsorption capacity over five cycles of reuse without significant loss. To quantify tartrazine, images were captured using a smartphone, and the RGB values were obtained using the ImageJ®free program. A partial least squares regression (PLS) was performed, obtaining a linear range of 0 to 7 mg L-1of tartrazine. The accuracy of the method was 99.4% (4.97 ± 0.74 mg L-1) for 10 samples of 5 mg L-1. The concentration of tartrazine was determined in two local soft drinks (14.1 mg L-1and 16.5 mg L-1), with results comparable to the UV-visible spectrophotometric method.

AUTHORS: Qingrun Liu, Dajun Wu, Yulun Chen, Zhe Chen, Shaofeng Yuan, Hang Yu, Yahui Guo, Yunfei Xie, He Qian, Weirong Yao

JOURNAL: Journal of hazardous materials

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Microplastics (MPs), an emerging pollutant in the environment and food, may adsorb other contaminants such as pesticide due to particles' properties. The adsorption behavior and their hazardous changes of four common types of MPs to thiram was investigated. The adsorption kinetics and isotherm models were fitted well using the pseudo-second-order model and the Langmuir model respectively, indicating forces such as van der Waals forces dominate, and the maximum adsorption capacity at pH values of 6-7 also indicates that electrostatic forces play a smaller role. The adsorption thermodynamic studies showed that the adsorption was a spontaneous and exothermic process. The decrease in the adsorption capacity as the concentration of MPs increases and more adsorption by aged MPs demonstrate that the adsorption process is related to the sites on the surface of MPs. Due to the influence of ionic strength, the adsorption capacity of MPs for thiram increases significantly when the adsorption process takes place in solutions with salinity or in orange and apple juices. The bioavailability of thiram adsorbed by PVC and PET increased significantly. This study highlights the strong role of MPs in food as carriers of pesticide residues in food systems and that the combined hazard should also be of concern.

JOURNAL: Redox biology

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Redox metabolism plays essential functions in the pathology of cancer and many other diseases. While several radiotracers for imaging redox metabolism have been developed, there are no reports of radiotracers for in vivo imaging of protein oxidation. Here we take the first step towards this goal and describe the synthesis and kinetic properties of a new positron emission tomography (PET) [18F]Fluoro-DCP radiotracer for in vivo imaging of protein sulfenylation. Time course biodistribution and PET/CT studies using xenograft animal models of Head and Neck Squamous Cell Cancer (HNSCC) demonstrate its capability to distinguish between tumors with radiation sensitive and resistant phenotypes consistent with previous reports of decreased protein sulfenylation in clinical specimens of radiation resistant HNSCC. We envision further development of this technology to aid research efforts towards improving diagnosis of patients with radiation resistant tumors.

Purpose: Preclinical studies suggest that trimebutine could be a potential treatment for glioblastoma. The aim of this study was to investigate the distribution, kinetics and tumor accumulation of [11C]trimebutine.

Method: A proliferation assay and cell scratch healing assay were performed to confirm the antitumor effects of trimebutine on C6 glioma cells in-vitro. Trimebutine was subsequently labeled with11C. The distribution and kinetics of [11C]trimebutine in health rats and rats with an orthotopic C6 glioma were evaluated by ex-vivo gamma counting and positron emission tomography, respectively. Blocking experiments with an excess of unlabeled trimebutine or the μ-opioid receptor ligand cyprodime were employed to determine if trimebutine exhibits saturable binding in the brain. In addition, plasma stability of the tracer was assessed.

Results: The proliferation assay and cell scratch healing assay confirmed that trimebutine has anti-tumor effects in-vitro. [11C]Trimebutine with a radiochemical purity >98 % was synthesized in 15 ± 5 % radiochemical yield. In peripheral organs, the highest accumulation of the tracer was detected in excretion organs. In the brain, the highest tracer uptake was observed in the brainstem and the lowest in the hypothalamus, although differences between regions were small. PET imaging showed rapid brain uptake of [11C]trimebutine, followed by a gradual washout. Administration of an intravenous dose of trimebutine (10 mg/kg) significantly decreased the uptake in all brain regions (p < 0.05), except midbrain. Likewise, administration of cyprodime (2 mg/kg) significantly reduced [11C]trimebutine uptake in the brain (p < 0.01). However, uptake of [11C]trimebutine in the tumor was not significantly different from its brain uptake in rats bearing an orthotopic C6 glioma. The percentage of intact [11C]trimebutine at 60 min post injection was only 1.7 ± 0.6 %.

Conclusion: Trimebutine exhibits inhibitory effects on the growth and migration of glioma cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. [11C]Trimebutine was able to penetrate the blood-brain barrier in rats and tracer uptake could be significantly reduced by administration of a μ-opioid receptor antagonist. However, [11C]trimebutine failed to selectively accumulate in orthotopic C6 glioma, which could be caused by low expression levels of the drug target in these tumors, or by fast metabolism of the tracer.

TITLE: Quantification of the Cannabinoid Type 1 Receptor Availability in the Mouse Brain

AUTHORS: Isabelle Miederer, Viktoria Wiegand, Nicole Bausbacher, Petra Leukel, Stephan Maus, Manuela A Hoffmann, Beat Lutz, Mathias Schreckenberger

JOURNAL: Frontiers in neuroanatomy

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Introduction: The endocannabinoid system is involved in several diseases such as addictive disorders, schizophrenia, post-traumatic stress disorder, and eating disorders. As often mice are used as the preferred animal model in translational research, in particular when using genetically modified mice, this study aimed to provide a systematic analysis ofin vivocannabinoid type 1 (CB1) receptor ligand-binding capacity using positron emission tomography (PET) using the ligand [18F]MK-9470. We then compared the PET results with literature data from immunohistochemistry (IHC) to review the consistency betweenex vivoprotein expression andin vivoligand binding.Methods: Six male C57BL/6J (6-9 weeks) mice were examined with the CB1 receptor ligand [18F]MK-9470 and small animal PET. Different brain regions were evaluated using the parameter %ID/ml. The PET results of the [18F]MK-9470 accumulation in the mouse brain were compared with immunohistochemical literature data.Results: The ligand [18F]MK-9470 was taken up into the mouse brain within 5 min after injection and exhibited slow kinetics. It accumulated highly in most parts of the brain. PET and IHC classifications were consistent for most parts of the telencephalon, while brain regions of the diencephalon, mesencephalon, and rhombencephalon were rated higher with PET than IHC.Conclusions: This preclinical [18F]MK-9470 study demonstrated the radioligand's applicability for imaging the region-specific CB1 receptor availability in the healthy adult mouse brain and thus offers the potential to study CB1 receptor availability in pathological conditions.

TITLE: Sorption of metal ions onto PET-derived microplastic fibres

AUTHORS: H Frost, T Bond, T Sizmur, M Felipe-Sotelo

JOURNAL: Environmental science. Processes & impacts

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
This study investigated microplastic polyester fibres representative of those shed during laundering as sorbents for metal ions. During sewage distribution and treatment, microplastics are exposed to elevated concentrations of metal ions, typically for several days. Cryogenic milling was used to generate polyethylene terephthalate (PET) fibres. Characterisation using optical microscopy and Raman spectroscopy revealed that milling did not cause significant chemical alteration to the fibres. Milled fibres were subsequently assessed in screening tests for their capacity to retain 12 metal ions-Sb(III), As(III), Cd(II), Cr(VI), Cu(II), Co(II), Pb(II), Hg(II), Mo(VI), Ni(II), V(V) and Zn(II)-at pH 8. All metal ions were sorbed onto PET fibres. The highest distribution coefficient (Kd) was observed for Pb2+(939 mL g-1), followed by Cd2+(898 mL g-1), Cu2+(507 mL g-1), Hg2+(403 mL g-1), and Zn2+(235 mL g-1). The extent of sorption is largely explicable by electrostatic interactions between the PET surface (1.95 point of zero net charge) and the predicted metal ion species. The sorption behaviour of Cd2+and Hg2+was examined in more detail since both showed high sorption capacity and are highly toxic. Kinetic experiments revealed that the sorption of both elements was relatively fast, with a steady state reached within six hours. Experimental data from isotherm tests fitted well to the Langmuir sorption model and demonstrated that PET fibres had a much greater sorption capacity for Hg2+(17.3-23.1 μg g-1) than for Cd2+(4.3-5.3 μg g-1). Overall, the results indicate that retention of metal ions onto PET fibres originating from laundry is expected during full-scale sewage treatment, which facilitates the subsequent transfer of metals into the terrestrial environment, given that sewage sludge is commonly applied to agricultural land.

TITLE: Targeting Soluble Amyloid Oligomers in Alzheimer's Disease: A Hypothetical Model Study Comparing Intrathecal Pseudodelivery of mAbs Against Intravenous Administration

AUTHORS: Manuel Menendez-Gonzalez

JOURNAL: Diseases (Basel, Switzerland)

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Background/objective: Neurotoxic soluble amyloid-β (Aβ) oligomers are key drivers of Alzheimer's pathology, with evidence suggesting that early targeting of these soluble forms may slow disease progression. Traditional intravenous (IV) monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) face challenges, including limited brain penetration and risks such as amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA). This hypothetical study aimed to model amyloid dynamics in early-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) and compare the efficacy of IV mAn with intrathecal pseudodelivery, a novel method that confines mAbs in a subcutaneous reservoir for selective amyloid clearance in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) without systemic exposure.

Methods: A mathematical framework was employed to simulate Aβ dynamics in patients with early-to-moderate AD. Two therapeutic approaches were compared: IV mAb and intrathecal pseudodelivery of mAb. The model incorporated amyloid kinetics, mAb affinity, protofibril size, and therapy-induced clearance rates to evaluate the impact of both methods on amyloid reduction, PET negativity timelines, and the risk of ARIA.

Results: Intrathecal pseudodelivery significantly accelerated Aβ clearance compared to IV administration, achieving amyloid PET scan negativity by month 132, as opposed to month 150 with IV mAb. This method demonstrated no ARIA risk and reduced amyloid reaccumulation. By targeting soluble Aβ species more effectively, intrathecal pseudodelivery emerged as a safer and more efficient strategy for early AD intervention.

Conclusions: Intrathecal pseudodelivery offers a promising alternative to IV mAbs, overcoming challenges associated with blood-brain barrier penetration and systemic side effects. Further research should focus on optimizing this approach and exploring combination therapies to enhance clinical outcomes in AD.

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
The NMDA receptor GluN2B subunit is a target of interest in neuropsychiatric disorders but to date there is no selective radiotracer available to quantify its availabilityin vivo. Here we report direct comparisons in non-human primates of three GluN2B-targeting radioligands:(R)-[11C]NR2B-Me,(R)-[18F]OF-Me-NB1, and(S)-[18F]OF-NB1. Plasma free fraction, metabolism, tissue distribution and kinetics, and quantitative kinetic modeling methods and parameters were evaluated in two adult rhesus macaques. Free fraction in plasma was <2% for(R)-[11C]NR2B-Me and(R)-[18F]OF-Me-NB1 and higher for(S)-[18F]OF-NB1 (15%). All radiotracers showed good brain uptake and distribution throughout grey matter, with substantial (>68%) blockade across the brain by the GluN2B-targeting drug Co-101,244 (0.25 mg/kg), including in the cerebellum. Time-activity curves were well-fitted by the one-tissue compartment model, with volume of distribution values of 20-40 mL/cm3for(R)-[11C]NR2B-Me, 8-16 mL/cm3for(R)-[18F]OF-Me-NB1, and 15-35 mL/cm3for(S)-[18F]OF-NB1. Estimates of regional non-displaceable binding potential were in the range of 2-3 for(R)-[11C]NR2B-Me and(S)-[18F]-OF-NB1, and 0.5-1 for(R)-[18F]OF-Me-NB1. Altogether, each radiotracer showed an acceptable profile for quantitative imaging of GluN2B.(S)-[18F]OF-NB1 has particularly promising imaging characteristics for potential translation into humans. However, the source of unexpected displaceable binding in the cerebellum for each of these compounds requires further investigation.

AUTHORS: John J Lee, Nicholas Metcalf, Tony A Durbin, Jennifer Byers, Kim Casey, Hussain Jafri, Manu S Goyal, Andrei G Vlassenko

JOURNAL: Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
The authors have developed a paradigm using positron emission tomography (PET) with multiple radiopharmaceutical tracers that combines measurements of cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (CMRGlc), cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2), cerebral blood flow (CBF), and cerebral blood volume (CBV), culminating in estimates of brain aerobic glycolysis (AG). These in vivo estimates of oxidative and non-oxidative glucose metabolism are pertinent to the study of the human brain in health and disease. The latest positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) scanners provide time-of-flight (TOF) imaging and critical improvements in spatial resolution and reduction of artifacts. This has led to significantly improved imaging with lower radiotracer doses. Optimized methods for the latest PET-CT scanners involve administering a sequence of inhaled15O-labeled carbon monoxide (CO) and oxygen (O2), intravenous15O-labeled water (H2O), and18F-deoxyglucose (FDG)-all within 2-h or 3-h scan sessions that yield high-resolution, quantitative measurements of CMRGlc, CMRO2, CBF, CBV, and AG. This methods paper describes practical aspects of scanning designed for quantifying brain metabolism with tracer kinetic models and arterial blood samples and provides examples of imaging measurements of human brain metabolism.

TITLE: Evaluation of the safety, biodistribution, dosimetry of [18F]AlF-NYM005 and initial experience in clear cell renal cell carcinoma: an interim analysis of a prospective trial

AUTHORS: Liping Yang, Wei Guo, Hongchao Ding, Xing Gao, Yuchao Xu, Menglu Wang, Xinyue Yang, Yue Zhao, Wenzhi Wang, Wei Liu, Fan Jia, Dayong Hou, Abiyasi Nanding, Liang Cheng, Hongxue Meng, Kezheng Wang

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: This first-in-human study aimed to evaluate the radiation dosimetry and whole-body biodistribution of [18F]AlF-NYM005, a novel small-molecule carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) targeting agent, and to investigate its ability to detect CAIX-positive tumors using PET scans in a cohort of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) patients.

Methods: [18F]AlF-NYM005 was synthesized using a fully automatic cassette module Mortenon M1 (Nuoyu, China). Thirty-five patients with a suspicious lesion considered primary renal malignancy or a history of ccRCC were prospectively recruited and studied. All patients underwent [18F]AlF-NYM005 PET/CT examinations and the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) was measured on conventional [18F]AlF-NYM005 PET/CT images. Among these patients, five patients underwent dynamic [18F]AlF-NYM005 PET/CT scanning (120 min) of the lower abdomen. Another subset of five ccRCC patients underwent sequential whole-body PET scans at 30, 60, 90, and 120 min (one of the five patients underwent additional 150 min and 180 min scans) after [18F]AlF-NYM005 injection to assess biodistribution and dosimetry. The influx constant (Ki) was calculated from the dynamic [18F]AlF-NYM005 PET/CT data using the Patlak model. Whole-body biodistribution was calculated as time-activity curves (TACs) describing dynamic uptake patterns in the patients' major organs, followed by calculation of tracer kinetics and cumulative organ activity. Effective doses of [18F]AlF-NYM005 and individual organ doses were also calculated.

Results: [18F]AlF-NYM005 was successfully synthesized with a radiochemical purity of > 95% and an average labeling yield of 36.5 ± 8.3%. All patients tolerated the PET examinations well, and no adverse side effects were observed. The total body effective dose was 7.6E-03 mSv/MBq. The highest agent uptake was observed in the kidneys, stomach, and liver, contributing to an effective dose of 0.0126 ± 0.0029 mSv/MBq. The TACs showed optimal normal organ uptake with high tumor uptake and long retention of up to 2 h post-injection. Notably, a rapid increase of the tracer followed by a rapid decrease in the blood pool, kidney, liver, and tumor lesions was observed, indicating that [18F]AlF-NYM005 was rapidly eliminated from blood and urine. For the kinetic data analysis, the Ki for the primary kidney lesions had a mean of 0.082 ± 0.057 ml/g/min. The CAIX-positive tumors displayed rapid uptake, and all lesions were detectable within 30 min, with no additional lesions observed in the subsequent multi-time point scans. The patient-level sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of [18F]AlF-NYM005 PET/CT were 93.8%, 75.0%, and 90% for group 1 and 92.3%, 100%, and 93.3% for group 2, respectively. For per-lymph node analysis, [18F]AlF-NYM005 PET/CT demonstrated 92.9% sensitivity, 90.5% specificity, and 91.8% accuracy in diagnosing metastatic lymph nodes. For per-distant metastasis analysis, it showed 90.5% sensitivity, 91.3% specificity, and 90.6% accuracy. The SUVmax of [18F]AlF-NYM005 PET/CT for primary ccRCC lesions was 15.5 ± 7.35. Tumor uptake was positive correlated with immunohistochemical staining findings.

Conclusion: This pilot study in ccRCC patients has demonstrated the safety, acceptable radiation dosimetry, favorable biodistribution, and exceptional tumor uptake of [18F]AlF-NYM005. The preliminary diagnostic study indicated the potential utility of [18F]AlF-NYM005 PET/CT, showing promising results in the diagnosis of primary or metastatic ccRCC.

TITLE: Comparative evaluation of Fe-, Zr-, and La-based metal-organic frameworks derived from recycled PET plastic bottles for arsenate removal

AUTHORS: Pandi Kalimuthu, Youjin Kim, Muthu Prabhu Subbaiah, Daewhan Kim, Byong-Hun Jeon, Jinho Jung

JOURNAL: Chemosphere

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) derived from recycled polyester (polyethylene terephthalate, PET) bottles were investigated in both batch and column studies for the removal of arsenate. As-synthesized Fe-MOF, Zr-MOF, and La-MOF were systematically analyzed by SEM, PXRD, FTIR, BET, and XPS techniques. The obtained MOFs showed high crystallinity with the specific surface areas of 128.3, 290.4, and 61.8 m2/g for Fe-MOF, Zr-MOF, and La-MOF, respectively. The Langmuir isotherm and pseudo-second-order kinetic model simulated arsenate adsorption on MOF materials well, which can be explained by electrostatic interactions, surface complexation, and ligand exchange mechanisms. The maximum adsorption capacities of arsenate onto Fe-MOF, Zr-MOF, and La-MOF were found to be 70.02, 85.72, and 114.28 mg/g at pH 7, respectively. The effect of pH and co-existing anions on the arsenate adsorption on MOF materials was also evaluated for practical applications. The MOF materials showed reduced adsorption capacity for arsenate by less than 10% up to four cycles of regeneration and did not induce any significant (p > 0.05) acute toxicity (<2.5% mortality) in Daphnia magna. In a flow-through system, Fe-MOF, Zr-MOF, and La-MOF were used to treat 176, 255, and 398 mL bed volumes of arsenate contaminated water, respectively, and consistently reduced the concentration of arsenate ions from 500 to 10 μg/L. This study clearly demonstrated that MOF materials derived from waste PET bottles are economically promising adsorbents for the successful elimination of arsenate species from aqueous environments.

TITLE: In Vivo Imaging of Fibroblast Activity Using a 68Ga-Labeled Fibroblast Activation Protein Alpha (FAP-α) Inhibitor: Study in a Mouse Rotator Cuff Repair Model

AUTHORS: Xueying Zhang, Daoyun Chen, John W Babich, Samuel J E Green, Xiang-Hua Deng, Scott A Rodeo

JOURNAL: The Journal of bone and joint surgery. American volume

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Background: Rotator cuff repair site failure is a well-established clinical concern. Tendon-to-bone healing is initiated by inflammatory mediators followed by matrix synthesis by fibroblasts. The kinetics of fibroblast accumulation and activity are currently poorly understood.

Methods: Ninety-six mice underwent supraspinatus tendon repair. Six were used for imaging using a novel 68Gallium (Ga)-labeled fibroblast activation protein alpha (FAP-α) inhibitor and positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET/CT) at days 0 (before surgery), 3, 7, 14, and 28. Sixty-eight animals were divided into 4 groups to be evaluated at 3, 7, 14, or 28 days. Twenty-two native shoulders from mice without surgery were used as the control group (intact tendon). Six animals from each group were used for histological analysis; 6 from each group were used for evaluation of fibroblastic response-related gene expression; and 10 mice each from the intact, 14-day, and 28-day groups were used for biomechanical testing.

Results: There was minimal localization of 68Ga-labeled FAP-α inhibitor in the shoulders at day 0 (before surgery). There was significantly increased uptake in the shoulders with surgery compared with the contralateral sides without surgery at 3, 7, and 14 days. 68Ga-labeled FAP-α inhibitor uptake in the surgically treated shoulders increased gradually and peaked at 14 days followed by a decrease at 28 days. Gene expression for smooth muscle alpha (α)-2 (acta2), FAP-α, and fibronectin increased postsurgery followed by a drop at 28 days. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that FAP-α-positive cell density followed a similar temporal trend, peaking at 14 days. All trends matched closely with the PET/CT results. Biomechanical testing demonstrated a gradual increase in failure load during the healing process.

Conclusions: 68Ga-labeled FAP-α inhibitor PET/CT allows facile, high-contrast in vivo 3-dimensional imaging of fibroblastic activity in a mouse rotator cuff repair model.

Clinical relevance: Noninvasive imaging of activated fibroblasts using labeled radiotracers may be a valuable tool to follow the progression of healing at the bone-tendon interface.

JOURNAL: Pharmaceuticals (Basel, Switzerland)

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a neurocutaneous disorder. Plexiform neurofibromas (PNFs) are benign tumors commonly formed in patients with NF1. PNFs have a high incidence of developing into malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) with a 5-year survival rate of only 30%. Therefore, the accurate diagnosis and differentiation of MPNSTs from benign PNFs are critical to patient management. We studied a fluorine-18 labeled tryptophan positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer, 1-(2-[18F]fluoroethyl)-L-tryptophan (L-[18F]FETrp), to detect NF1-associated tumors in an animal model. An ex vivo biodistribution study of L-[18F]FETrp showed a similar tracer distribution and kinetics between the wild-type and triple mutant mice with the highest uptake in the pancreas. Bone uptake was stable. Brain uptake was low during the 90-min uptake period. Static PET imaging at 60 min post-injection showed L-[18F]FETrp had a comparable tumor uptake with [1⁸F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). However, L-[18F]FETrp showed a significantly higher tumor-to-brain ratio than FDG (n= 4,p< 0.05). Sixty-minute-long dynamic PET scans using the two radiotracers showed similar kidney, liver, and lung kinetics. A dysregulated tryptophan metabolism in NF1 mice was further confirmed using immunohistostaining. L-[18F]FETrp is warranted to further investigate differentiating malignant NF1 tumors from benign PNFs. The study may reveal the tryptophan-kynurenine pathway as a therapeutic target for treating NF1.

ABSTRACT:
Wilson's disease (WD) is an inherited disorder of copper metabolism associated with mutations inATP7Bgene. We have shown that the administration of an adeno-associated vector (AAV) encoding a mini version of human ATP7B (VTX-801) provides long-term correction of copper metabolism in a murine WD model. In preparation of a future clinical trial, we have evaluated by positron emission tomography (PET) the value of64Cu biodistribution, excretion pattern, and blood kinetics as pharmacodynamic biomarkers of VTX-801 effects. Six-week-old WD mice were injected intravenously with increasing doses of VTX-801 and 3 weeks or 3 months later with [64Cu]CuCl2. Untreated WD and wild-type (WT) mice were included as controls. Control WD mice showed increased hepatic64Cu retention, reduced fecal excretion of the radiotracer, and altered64Cu blood kinetics (BK) compared with WT mice. VTX-801 treatment in WD mice resulted in a significant reduction of hepatic64Cu accumulation, the restoration of fecal64Cu excretion, and the correction of64Cu BK. This study showed that VTX-801 restores physiological copper metabolism in WD mice, confirming the mechanism of action of VTX-801, and demonstrated the translational potential of [64Cu]CuCl2-PET to explore VTX-801 pharmacodynamics in a minimally invasive and sensitive manner in WD patients.

ABSTRACT:
This study focuses on the probable use of PET waste black carbon (PETWBC) and rice straw black carbon (RSBC) as an adsorbent for Acid Red 27 (AR 27) adsorption. The prepared adsorbent is characterized by FE-SEM and FT-IR. Batch adsorption experiments were conducted with the influencing of different operational conditions namely time of contact (1-180 min), AR 27 concentration (5-70 mg/L), adsorbent dose (0.5-20 g/L), pH (2-10), and temperature (25-60°C). High coefficient value [PETWBC (R2 = 0.94), and RSBC (R2 = 0.97)] of process optimization model suggesting that this model was significant, where pH and adsorbent dose expressively stimulus removal efficiency including 99.88, and 99.89% for PETWBC, and RSBC at pH (2). Furthermore, the machine learning approaches (ANN and BB-RSM) revealed a good association between the tested and projected value. Pseudo-second-order was the well-suited kinetics, where Freundlich isotherm could explain better equilibrium adsorption data. Thermodynamic study shows AR 27 adsorption is favourable, endothermic, and spontaneous. Environmental friendliness properties are confirmed by desorption studies and satisfactory results also attain from real wastewater experiments. Finally, this study indicates that PETWBC and RSBC could be potential candidates for the adsorption of AR 27 from wastewater.

ABSTRACT:
The sigma-1 receptor (σ1R) is a stress-activated chaperone protein that has emerged as a significant therapeutic target for neurodegenerative disorders. Developing effective positron emission tomography (PET) imaging probes targeting σ1R is crucial for visualizing its distribution and function in the brain, as well as facilitating related drug development. In this study, two novel11C-labeled PET probes based on the structure of a potent σ1R ligand Lan-0101 are designed and synthesized. PET imaging studies in mice reveal that [11C]CNY-01 exhibits good brain uptake and binding specificity. Subsequent evaluation in non-human primates further demonstrates that [11C]CNY-01 displays favorable brain penetration, slow clearance kinetics, and characteristics of irreversible binding to its target in blockage experiments. To assess the clinical potential of the probe, both in vitro experiments and in vivo PET imaging using [11C]CNY-01 are conducted in Alzheimer's disease (AD) transgenic mouse models. These studies reveal a significant decrease in σ1R expression in the brain under conditions of AD amyloid pathology and microglial activation, highlighting the probe's sensitivity to disease-related receptor changes. This work establishes [11C]CNY-01 as a promising tool for investigating the relationship between σ1R and neurological disorders, potentially advancing the understanding of σ1R's role in disease pathophysiology and therapeutic interventions.

ABSTRACT:
The noradrenaline system attracts attention for its role in mood disorders and neurodegenerative diseases but the lack of well-validated methods impairs our understanding when assessing its function and release in vivo. This study combines simultaneous positron emission tomography (PET) and microdialysis to explore if [11C]yohimbine, a selective antagonist radioligand of the α2 adrenoceptors, may be used to assess in vivo changes in synaptic noradrenaline during acute pharmacological challenges. Anesthetised Göttingen minipigs were positioned in a head holder in a PET/CT device. Microdialysis probes were placed in the thalamus, striatum and cortex and dialysis samples were collected every 10 min. Three 90 min [11C]yohimbine scans were acquired: at baseline and at two timepoints after the administration of amphetamine (1-10 mg/kg), a non-specific releaser of dopamine and noradrenaline, or nisoxetine (1 mg/kg), a specific noradrenaline transporter inhibitor. [11C]yohimbine volumes of distribution (VT) were obtained using the Logan kinetic model. Both challenges induced a significant decrease in yohimbine VT, with time courses reflecting their different mechanisms of action. Dialysis samples revealed a significant increase in noradrenaline extracellular concentrations after challenge and an inverse correlation with changes in yohimbine VT. These data suggest that [11C]yohimbine can be used to evaluate acute variations in synaptic noradrenaline concentrations after pharmacological challenges.

ABSTRACT:
Introduction: Synapse loss is one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and is associated with cognitive decline. In this study, we tested [18F]SDM-16, a novel metabolically stable SV2A PET imaging probe, in the transgenic APPswe/PS1dE9 (APP/PS1) mouse model of AD and age-matched wild-type (WT) mice at 12 months of age.

Methods: Based on previous preclinical PET imaging studies using [11C]UCB-J and [18F]SynVesT-1 in the same strain animals, we used the simplified reference tissue model (SRTM), with brain stem as the pseudo reference region to calculate distribution volume ratios (DVRs).

Results: To simplify and streamline the quantitative analysis, we compared the standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs) from different imaging windows to DVRs and found that the averaged SUVRs from 60-90 min post-injection (p.i.) are most consistent with the DVRs. Thus, we used averaged SUVRs from 60-90 min for group comparisons and found statistically significant differences in the tracer uptake in different brain regions, e.g., hippocampus (p= 0.001), striatum (p= 0.002), thalamus (p= 0.003), and cingulate cortex (p= 0.0003).

Conclusions: In conclusion, [18F]SDM-16 was used to detect decreased SV2A levels in the brain of APP/PS1 AD mouse model at one year old. Our data suggest that [18F]SDM-16 has similar statistical power in detecting the synapse loss in APP/PS1 mice as [11C]UCB-J and [18F]SynVesT-1, albeit later imaging window (60-90 minp.i.) is needed when SUVR is used as a surrogate for DVR for [18F]SDM-16 due to its slower brain kinetics.

TITLE: Amiodarone attenuates cardiac Rubidium-82 in consecutive PET/CT scans in a rodent model

AUTHORS: Simon Bentsen, Lia E Bang, Philip Hasbak, Andreas Kjaer, Rasmus S Ripa

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear cardiology : official publication of the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Background: Risk stratification and diagnosis using Rubidium-82 (82Rb) positron emission tomography (PET) is a routine clinical approach in coronary artery disease (CAD). Various drugs are used to treat CAD; however, whether any of them change the uptake of82Rb in the heart has not been investigated. The aim of this study is to determine whether drugs used in treatment of CAD affect the uptake of82Rb in the heart in healthy rats.

Methods: Seventy-seven Sprague-Dawley rats were included in the cross-sectional study. All rats underwent baseline82Rb PET/CT and divided into eleven groups treated with different drugs. One group was control group (no treatment), eight groups were treated with monotherapy (amiodarone, acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), clopidogrel, ticagrelor, atorvastatin, enalapril, amlodipine, metoprolol succinate), and two groups were treated with polypharmacy (ASA, ticagrelor, atorvastatin, amlodipine or ASA, clopidogrel, atorvastatin, amlodipine). Once a day, they were administered pharmacological therapy through oral gavage, and on day seven, follow-up scanned with82Rb PET/CT.

Results: In the control group without pharmacological treatment, no difference in the standard uptake value (SUV) ratio between heart and muscle from baseline to follow-up (5.8 vs 7.0, P = .3) was found. The group treated with amiodarone had a significantly reduced SUV ratio from baseline to follow-up (5.8 vs 5.1, P = .008). All other drugs investigated had no difference in SUV ratio from baseline to follow-up.

Conclusion: In this study, we showed that drugs normally used to treat CAD do not affect the uptake of82Rb. However, amiodarone result in a significantly lowered82Rb uptake, compared to control. This information about amiodarone would probably not change the size assessment of a myocardial perfusion defect in a clinical setting. However, it could change the kinetic parameters when assessing absolute myocardial blood flow in patients treated with amiodarone.

TITLE: Bidirectional dynamic frame prediction network for total-body [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 and [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 PET images

AUTHORS: Qianyi Yang, Wenbo Li, Zhenxing Huang, Zixiang Chen, Wenjie Zhao, Yunlong Gao, Xinlan Yang, Yongfeng Yang, Hairong Zheng, Dong Liang, Jianjun Liu, Ruohua Chen, Zhanli Hu

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Total-body dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with total-body coverage and ultrahigh sensitivity has played an important role in accurate tracer kinetic analyses in physiology, biochemistry, and pharmacology. However, dynamic PET scans typically entail prolonged durations ([Formula: see text]60 minutes), potentially causing patient discomfort and resulting in artifacts in the final images. Therefore, we propose a dynamic frame prediction method for total-body PET imaging via deep learning technology to reduce the required scanning time.

Methods: On the basis of total-body dynamic PET data acquired from 13 subjects who received [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 (68Ga-FAPI) and 24 subjects who received [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 (68Ga-PSMA), we propose a bidirectional dynamic frame prediction network that uses the initial and final 10 min of PET imaging data (frames 1-6 and frames 25-30, respectively) as inputs. The peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index measure (SSIM) were employed as evaluation metrics for an image quality assessment. Moreover, we calculated parametric images (68Ga-FAPI: [Formula: see text],68Ga-PSMA: [Formula: see text]) based on the supplemented sequence data to observe the quantitative accuracy of our approach. Regions of interest (ROIs) and statistical analyses were utilized to evaluate the performance of the model.

Results: Both the visual and quantitative results illustrate the effectiveness of our approach. The generated dynamic PET images yielded PSNRs of 36.056 ± 0.709 dB for the68Ga-PSMA group and 33.779 ± 0.760 dB for the68Ga-FAPI group. Additionally, the SSIM reached 0.935 ± 0.006 for the68Ga-FAPI group and 0.922 ± 0.009 for the68Ga-PSMA group. By conducting a quantitative analysis on the parametric images, we obtained PSNRs of 36.155 ± 4.813 dB (68Ga-PSMA, [Formula: see text]) and 43.150 ± 4.102 dB (68Ga-FAPI, [Formula: see text]). The obtained SSIM values were 0.932 ± 0.041 (68Ga-PSMA) and 0.980 ± 0.011 (68Ga-FAPI). The ROI analysis conducted on our generated dynamic PET sequences also revealed that our method can accurately predict temporal voxel intensity changes, maintaining overall visual consistency with the ground truth.

Conclusion: In this work, we propose a bidirectional dynamic frame prediction network for total-body68Ga-PSMA and68Ga-FAPI PET imaging with a reduced scan duration. Visual and quantitative analyses demonstrated that our approach performed well when it was used to predict one-hour dynamic PET images. https://github.com/OPMZZZ/BDF-NET .

TITLE: Data-Driven Motion Detection and Event-by-Event Correction for Brain PET: Comparison with Vicra

ABSTRACT:
Head motion degrades image quality and causes erroneous parameter estimates in tracer kinetic modeling in brain PET studies. Existing motion correction methods include frame-based image registration (FIR) and correction using real-time hardware-based motion tracking (HMT) information. However, FIR cannot correct for motion within 1 predefined scan period, and HMT is not readily available in the clinic since it typically requires attaching a tracking device to the patient. In this study, we propose a motion correction framework with a data-driven algorithm, that is, using the PET raw data itself, to address these limitations.Methods:We propose a data-driven algorithm, centroid of distribution (COD), to detect head motion. In COD, the central coordinates of the line of response of all events are averaged over 1-s intervals to generate a COD trace. A point-to-point change in the COD trace in 1 direction that exceeded a user-defined threshold was defined as a time point of head motion, which was followed by manually adding additional motion time points. All the frames defined by such time points were reconstructed without attenuation correction and rigidly registered to a reference frame. The resulting transformation matrices were then used to perform the final motion-compensated reconstruction. We applied the new COD framework to 23 human dynamic datasets, all containing large head motion, with18F-FDG (n= 13) and11C-UCB-J ((R)-1-((3-(11C-methyl-11C)pyridin-4-yl)methyl)-4-(3,4,5-trifluorophenyl)pyrrolidin-2-one) (n= 10) and compared its performance with FIR and with HMT using Vicra (an optical HMT device), which can be considered the gold standard.Results:The COD method yielded a 1.0% ± 3.2% (mean ± SD across all subjects and 12 gray matter regions) SUV difference for18F-FDG (3.7% ± 5.4% for11C-UCB-J) compared with HMT, whereas no motion correction (NMC) and FIR yielded -15.7% ± 12.2% (-20.5% ± 15.8%) and -4.7% ± 6.9% (-6.2% ± 11.0%), respectively. For18F-FDG dynamic studies, COD yielded differences of 3.6% ± 10.9% inKivalue as compared with HMT, whereas NMC and FIR yielded -18.0% ± 39.2% and -2.6% ± 19.8%, respectively. For11C-UCB-J, COD yielded 3.7% ± 5.2% differences inVTcompared with HMT, whereas NMC and FIR yielded -20.0% ± 12.5% and -5.3% ± 9.4%, respectively.Conclusion:The proposed COD-based data-driven motion correction method outperformed FIR and achieved comparable or even better performance than the Vicra HMT method in both static and dynamic studies.

TITLE: Characterization of Structurally Diverse 18F-Labeled d-TCO Derivatives as a PET Probe for Bioorthogonal Pretargeted Imaging

AUTHORS: Karuna Adhikari, Jonatan Dewulf, Christel Vangestel, Pieter Van der Veken, Sigrid Stroobants, Filipe Elvas, Koen Augustyns

JOURNAL: ACS omega

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
The pretargeted imaging strategy using inverse electron demand Diels-Alder (IEDDA) cycloaddition between atrans-cyclooctene (TCO) and tetrazine (Tz) has emerged and rapidly grown as a promising concept to improve radionuclide imaging and therapy in oncology. This strategy has mostly relied on the use of radiolabeled Tz together with TCO-modified targeting vectors leading to a rapid growth of the number of available radiolabeled tetrazines, while only a few radiolabeled TCOs are currently reported. Here, we aim to develop novel and structurally diverse18F-labeled cis-dioxolane-fused TCO (d-TCO) derivatives to further expand the bioorthogonal toolbox forin vivoligation and evaluate their potential for positron emission tomography (PET) pretargeted imaging.Results:A small series of d-TCO derivatives were synthesized and tested for their reactivity against tetrazines, with all compounds showing fast reaction kinetics with tetrazines. A fluorescence-based pretargeted blocking study was developed to investigate thein vivoligation of these compounds without labor-intensive prior radiochemical development. Two compounds showed excellentin vivoligation results with blocking efficiencies of 95 and 97%. Two novel18F-labeled d-TCO radiotracers were developed, from which [18F]MICA-214showed goodin vitrostability, favorable pharmacokinetics, and moderatein vivostability. Micro-PET pretargeted imaging with [18F]MICA-214in mice bearing LS174T tumors treated with tetrazine-modified CC49 monoclonal antibody (mAb) (CC49-Tz) showed significantly higher uptake in tumor tissue in the pretargeted group (CC49-Tz 2.16 ± 0.08% ID/mL) when compared to the control group with nonmodified mAb (CC49 1.34 ± 0.07% ID/mL).Conclusions:A diverse series of fast-reacting fluorinated d-TCOs were synthesized. A pretargeted blocking approach in tumor-bearing mice allowed the choice of a lead compound with fast reaction kinetics with Tz. A novel18F-labeled d-TCO tracer was developed and used in a pretargeted PET imaging approach, allowing specific tumor visualization in a mouse model of colorectal cancer. Although further optimization of the radiotracer is needed to enhance the tumor-to-background ratios for pretargeted imaging, we anticipate that the18F-labeled d-TCO will find use in studies where increased hydrophilicity and fast bioconjugation are required.

TITLE: Templating of catalytic gold and silver nanoparticles by waste plastic PET-derived hydrogel playing a dual role of a reductant and a matrix

AUTHORS: Kayee Chan, Anatoly Zinchenko

JOURNAL: Waste management (New York, N.Y.)

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
The progressive accumulation of discarded plastic in the environment demands further development of waste management of plastic waste and conversion technologies of such waste to value-added materials. Recently, the conversion of plastic waste to functional materials via chemical recycling has attracted considerable attention. In this report, plastic waste (PET) was utilized for the preparation of a hydrogel-based catalyst via a cross-linking reaction of PET-derived oligo(terephthalamide)s followed by the electroless metallization. The polymeric matrix of PET-derived hydrogel plays multiple roles of (i) an adsorption media for noble metal ions such as Au3+and Ag+, (ii) a reducing agent of Au3+and Ag+ions to Au0and Ag0, and (iii) a matrix for the controlled growth of Au and Ag nanoparticles (AuNPs and AgNPs). The obtained hybrid hydrogels after metallization contained well-dispersed AuNPs and AgNPs of 6.1 ± 3.7 nm or 6.1 ± 1.4 nm size, respectively. The catalytic activities of the hybrid hydrogels with metal nanoparticles were studied in a model system of p-nitrophenol reduction in an aqueous solution. The hybrid materials of both Au@hydrogel and Ag@hydrogel were catalytically active for the reduction of p-nitrophenol, obeying the first-order kinetics. Importantly, the AuNPs or AgNPs in the hydrogel matrix preserved the original catalytic activity after multiple p-nitrophenol reduction reactions, showing a promising reusability of the catalysts. The proposed here approach aims to broaden the scope of conversion routes of plastic waste to value-added materials as well as to develop new types of polymeric matrices for templating and growth of metal nanoparticles for catalytic applications.

JOURNAL: Journal of medicinal chemistry

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Silicon Fluoride Acceptors (SiFAs) enable18F-labeling of complex peptides via isotope exchange under exceptionally mild conditions. SiFA radiopharmaceuticals have been clinically validated for diagnosing and treating cancers as tracers for positron emission tomography (PET) and radiotwin theranostics. Despite these advances, conventional phenyl SiFAs (PhSiFAs) require complex substrate engineering to mask their lipophilicity, which complicates the design of new tracers. Here, we report a new and diverse class of heteroaromatic SiFA derivatives (HetSiFAs) that are significantly less lipophilic than classical PhSiFAs. We show that HetSiFAs retain suitable stability without compromising labeling kinetics. We highlight the performance of a pyrazole-HetSiFA for rapid and efficient18F-labeling within a model TATE-peptide and show that the resulting PET tracer clears through the kidneys with minimal defluorination in mice. Novel radiopharmaceuticals incorporating HetSiFAs can capitalize on the improved and flexible pharmacokinetic parameters and excellent18F-fluorination efficiency offered by these scaffolds.

TITLE: Precision measurements of brain oxygen utilization with positron emission tomography

AUTHORS: John J Lee, Joshua S Shimony, Nicholas Metcalf, Andrei G Vlassenko, Manu S Goyal

JOURNAL: bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Oxygen utilization is important for studies of brain metabolism, alongside other measurements such as for glucose metabolism. Oxygen and other measurements with [15O] tracers and PET, however, are significantly more challenging than measurements of [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose, the standard for probing tissue glucose metabolism in vivo, in part due to the much shorter radioactive half-life of [15O]. This work examines details of precision measurement of [15O] tracers and their kinetics. Investigations of arterial input functions (AIFs) and image-derived input functions (IDIFs) have figured prominently for PET, but [15O] tracers are rarely studied given the small numbers of PET facilities equipped to work with these tracers, particularly in their inhaled form. Estimates of IDIFs and AIFs for [15O] tracers have demonstrably distinct characteristics arising from instrumentation as well as circulatory physiology. To reconcile IDIFs and AIFs, we developed a generalizable model for bolus tracer transport, corrected for known effects of instrumentation for measuring IDIFs and AIFs, and found intravascular[15O]CO to be especially suited for constructing a robust recovery coefficient for IDIFs compared against AIFs. Within a Bayesian framework for posterior estimation and estimating data evidence, IDIFs provide parameter estimates compatible with AIFs in the setting of biological variability. IDIFs also provide data evidence that exceeds that of results from AIFs. These suggest that scalar recovery coefficients may be adequate to estimate partial volume effects, and that the circulatory consistency of internal carotid IDIFs with brain tissue perfusion provides greater precision than what can be estimated using radial artery AIFs, which exhibit greater variability of recirculation wave forms.

TITLE: Parametric Imaging of P-Glycoprotein Function at the Blood-Brain Barrier Using kE,brain-maps Generated from [11C]Metoclopramide PET Data in Rats, Nonhuman Primates and Humans

AUTHORS: Louise Breuil, Myriam El Biali, Dominique Vodovar, Solène Marie, Sylvain Auvity, Martin Bauer, Sébastien Goutal, Sebastian Rodrigo, Oliver Langer, Nicolas Tournier

JOURNAL: Molecular imaging and biology

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: PET imaging using [11C]metoclopramide revealed the importance of P-glycoprotein (P-gp, ABCB1) in mediating the brain-to-blood efflux of substrates across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). In this work, the elimination rate constant from the brain (kE,brain), calculated from dynamic PET images without the need for arterial blood sampling, was evaluated as an outcome parameter for the interpretation of [11C]metoclopramide PET data.

Procedures: kE,brainparameter was obtained by linear regression of log-transformed brain time-activity curves (TACs). kE,brainvalues (h-1) obtained under baseline conditions were compared with values obtained after complete P-gp inhibition using tariquidar in rats (n = 4) and baboons (n = 4) or after partial inhibition using cyclosporine A in humans (n = 10). In baboons, the sensitivity of kE,brainto measure complete P-gp inhibition was compared with outcome parameters derived from kinetic modeling using a 1-tissue compartment model (1-TCM). Finally, kE,brain-maps were generated in each species using PMOD software.

Results: The linear part of the log-transformed brain TACs occurred from 10 to 30 min after radiotracer injection in rats, from 15 to 60 min in baboons, and from 20 to 60 min in humans. P-gp inhibition significantly decreased kE,brainvalues by 39 ± 12% in rats (p < 0.01), by 32 ± 6% in baboons (p < 0.001), and by 37 ± 22% in humans (p < 0.001). In baboons, P-gp inhibition consistently decreased the brain-to-plasma efflux rate constant k2(36 ± 9%, p < 0.01) leading to an increase in the total brain volume of distribution (VT, 101 ± 12%, p < 0.001). In all studied species, brain kE,brain-maps displayed decreased P-gp-mediated efflux across the BBB.

Conclusions: kE,brainof [11C]metoclopramide provides a simple outcome parameter to describe P-gp function in the living brain when arterial input function data are unavailable, although less sensitive than VT. kE,brain-maps represent easy to compute parametric images reflecting the effect of P-gp on [11C]metoclopramide elimination from the brain.

TITLE: Assessment of resting myocardial blood flow in regions of known transmural scar to confirm accuracy and precision of 3D cardiac positron emission tomography

AUTHORS: Robert M Bober, Richard V Milani, Sergey M Kachur, Daniel P Morin

JOURNAL: EJNMMI research

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Background: Composite invasive and non-invasive data consistently demonstrate that resting myocardial blood flow (rMBF) in regions of known transmural myocardial scar (TMS) converge on a value of ~ 0.30 mL/min/g or lower. This value has been confirmed using the 3 most common myocardial perfusion agents (13N,15O-H2O and82Rb) incorporating various kinetic models on older 2D positron emission tomography (PET) systems. Thus, rMBF in regions of TMS can serve as a reference "truth" to evaluate low-end accuracy of various PET systems and software packages (SWPs). Using82Rb on a contemporary 3D-PET-CT system, we sought to determine whether currently available SWP can accurately and precisely measure rMBF in regions of known TMS.

Results: Median rMBF (in mL/min/g) and COV in regions of TMS were 0.71 [IQR 0.52-1.02] and 0.16 with 4DM; 0.41 [0.34-0.54] and 0.10 with 4DM-FVD; 0.66 [0.51-0.85] and 0.11 with Cedars; 0.51 [0.43-0.61] and 0.08 with Emory-Votaw; 0.37 [0.30-0.42], 0.07 with Emory-Ottawa, and 0.26 [0.23-0.32], COV 0.07 with HeartSee.

Conclusions: SWPs varied widely in low end accuracy based on measurement of rMBF in regions of known TMS. 3D PET using82Rb and HeartSee software accurately (0.26 mL/min/g, consistent with established values) and precisely (COV = 0.07) quantified rMBF in regions of TMS. The Emory-Ottawa software yielded the next-best accuracy (0.37 mL/min/g), though rMBF was higher than established gold-standard values in ~ 5% of the resting scans. 4DM, 4DM-FDV, Cedars and Emory-Votaw SWP consistently resulted values higher than the established gold standard (0.71, 0.41, 0.66, 0.51 mL/min/g, respectively), with higher interscan variability (0.16, 0.11, 0.11, and 0.09, respectively).

JOURNAL: Alzheimer's & dementia (New York, N. Y.)

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Introduction: Hyperexcitability and epileptiform activity are commonplace in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and associated with impaired cognitive function. The anti-seizure drug levetiracetam (LEV) is currently being evaluated in clinical trials for ability to reduce epileptiform activity and improve cognitive function in AD. The purpose of our studies was to establish a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationship with LEV in an amyloidogenic mouse model of AD to enable predictive preclinical to clinical translation, using the rigorous preclinical testing pipeline of the Model Organism Development and Evaluation for Late-Onset Alzheimer's Disease Preclinical Testing Core.

Methods: A multi-tier approach was applied that included quality assurance and quality control of the active pharmaceutical ingredient, PK/PD modeling, positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI), functional outcomes, and transcriptomics. 5XFAD mice were treated chronically with LEV for 3 months at doses in line with those allometrically scaled to the clinical dose range.

Results: Pharmacokinetics of LEV demonstrated sex differences in Cmax, AUC0-∞, and CL/F, and a dose dependence in AUC0-∞. After chronic dosing at 10, 30, 56 mg/kg, PET/MRI tracer18F-AV45, and18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) showed specific regional differences with treatment. LEV did not significantly improve cognitive outcomes. Transcriptomics performed by nanoString demonstrated drug- and dose-related changes in gene expression relevant to human brain regions and pathways congruent with changes in18F-FDG uptake.

Discussion: This study represents the first report of PK/PD assessment of LEV in 5XFAD mice. Overall, these results highlighted non-linear kinetics based on dose and sex. Plasma concentrations of the 10 mg/kg dose in 5XFAD overlapped with human plasma concentrations used for studies of mild cognitive impairment, while the 30 and 56 mg/kg doses were reflective of doses used to treat seizure activity. Post-treatment gene expression analysis demonstrated LEV dose-related changes in immune function and neuronal-signaling pathways relevant to human AD, and aligned with regional18F-FDG uptake. Overall, this study highlights the importance of PK/PD relationships in preclinical studies to inform clinical study design.

Highlights: Significant sex differences in pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam were observed in 5XFAD mice.Plasma concentrations of 10 mg/kg levetiracetam dose in 5XFAD overlapped with human plasma concentration used in the clinic.Drug- and dose-related differences in gene expression relevant to human brain regions and pathways were also similar to brain region-specific changes in 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake.

AUTHORS: Wilson Lin, German Oscar Fonseca Cabrera, Eduardo Aluicio-Sarduy, Todd E Barnhart, Jason C Mixdorf, Zibo Li, Zhanhong Wu, Jonathan W Engle

JOURNAL: Bioconjugate chemistry

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Cobalt-sarcophagine complexes exhibit high kinetic inertness under various stringent conditions, but there is limited literature on radiolabeling and in vivo positron emission tomography (PET) imaging using no carrier added55Co. To fill this gap, this study first investigates the radiolabeling of DiAmSar (DSar) with55Co, followed by stability evaluation in human serum and EDTA, pharmacokinetics in mice, and a direct comparison with [55Co]CoCl2to assess differences in pharmacokinetics. Furthermore, the radiolabeling process was successfully used to generate the NTSR1-targeted PET agent [55Co]Co-NT-Sarcage (a DSar-functionalized SR142948 derivative) and administered to HT29 tumor xenografted mice. The [55Co]Co-DSar complex can be formed at 37 °C with purity and stability suitable for preclinical in vivo radiopharmaceutical applications, and [55Co]Co-NT-Sarcage demonstrated prominent tumor uptake with a low background signal. In a direct comparison with [64Cu]Cu-NT-Sarcage, [55Co]Co-NT-Sarcage achieved a higher tumor-to-liver ratio but with overall similar biodistribution profile. These results demonstrate that Sar would be a promising chelator for constructing Co-based radiopharmaceuticals including55Co for PET and58mCo for therapeutic applications.

ABSTRACT:
Neuroinflammation is associated with a number of brain diseases, making it a common feature of cerebral pathology. Among the best-known biomarkers for neuroinflammation in Positron Emission Tomography (PET) research is the 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO). This study aims to investigate the binding kinetics of a novel TSPO PET radiotracer, [18F]LW223, in mice and specifically assess its volume of non-displaceable binding () in brain as well as investigate the use of simplified analysis approaches for quantification of [18F]LW223 PET data. Adult male mice were injected with [18F]LW223 and varying concentrations of LW223 (0.003-0.55 mg/kg) to estimateof [18F]LW223. Dynamic PET imaging with arterial input function studies and radiometabolite studies were conducted. Simplified quantification methods, standard uptake values (SUV) and apparent volume of distribution (), were investigated. [18F]LW223 had lowin the brain (<10% of total binding) and low radiometabolism (∼15-20%). The 2-tissue compartment model provided the best fit for [18F]LW223 PET data, although its correlation withorallowed for [18F]LW223 brain PET data quantification in healthy animals while using simpler experimental and analytical approaches. [18F]LW223 has the required properties to become a successful TSPO PET radiotracer.

TITLE: Evaluating the immunologically "cold" tumor microenvironment after treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors utilizing PET imaging of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells in breast cancer mouse models

ABSTRACT:
Background: Immune-positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with tracers that target CD8 and granzyme B has shown promise in predicting the therapeutic response following immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) in immunologically "hot" tumors. However, immune dynamics in the low T-cell infiltrating "cold" tumor immune microenvironment during ICB remain poorly understood. This study uses molecular imaging to evaluate changes in CD4 + T cells and CD8 + T cells during ICB in breast cancer models and examines biomarkers of response.

Methods: [89Zr]Zr-DFO-CD4 and [89Zr]Zr-DFO-CD8 radiotracers were used to quantify changes in intratumoral and splenic CD4 T cells and CD8 T cells in response to ICB treatment in 4T1 and MMTV-HER2 mouse models, which represent immunologically "cold" tumors. A correlation between PET quantification metrics and long-term anti-tumor response was observed. Further biological validation was obtained by autoradiography and immunofluorescence.

Results: Following ICB treatment, an increase in the CD8-specific PET signal was observed within 6 days, and an increase in the CD4-specific PET signal was observed within 2 days in tumors that eventually responded to immunotherapy, while no significant differences in CD4 or CD8 were found at the baseline of treatment that differentiated responders from nonresponders. Furthermore, mice whose tumors responded to ICB had a lower CD8 PET signal in the spleen and a higher CD4 PET signal in the spleen compared to non-responders. Intratumoral spatial heterogeneity of the CD8 and CD4-specific PET signals was lower in responders compared to non-responders. Finally, PET imaging, autoradiography, and immunofluorescence signals were correlated when comparing in vivo imaging to ex vivo validations.

Conclusions: CD4- and CD8-specific immuno-PET imaging can be used to characterize the in vivo distribution of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells in response to immune checkpoint blockade. Imaging metrics that describe the overall levels and distribution of CD8 + T cells and CD4 + T cells can provide insight into immunological alterations, predict biomarkers of response to immunotherapy, and guide clinical decision-making in those tumors where the kinetics of the response differ.

TITLE: Temperature Cycling Enables Efficient 13C SABRE-SHEATH Hyperpolarization and Imaging of [1-13C]-Pyruvate

JOURNAL: Journal of the American Chemical Society

ABSTRACT:
Molecular metabolic imaging in humans is dominated by positron emission tomography (PET). An emerging nonionizing alternative is hyperpolarized MRI of13C-pyruvate, which is innocuous and has a central role in metabolism. However, similar to PET, hyperpolarized MRI with dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization (d-DNP) is complex costly, and requires significant infrastructure. In contrast, Signal Amplification By Reversible Exchange (SABRE) is a fast, cheap, and scalable hyperpolarization technique. SABRE in SHield Enables Alignment Transfer to Heteronuclei (SABRE-SHEATH) can transfer polarization from parahydrogen to13C in pyruvate; however, polarization levels remained low relative to d-DNP (1.7% with SABRE-SHEATH versus ≈60% with DNP). Here we introduce a temperature cycling method for SABRE-SHEATH that enables >10% polarization on [1-13C]-pyruvate, sufficient for successfulin vivoexperiments. First, at lower temperatures, ≈20% polarization is accumulated on SABRE catalyst-bound pyruvate, which is released into free pyruvate at elevated temperatures. A kinetic model of differential equations is developed that explains this effect and characterizes critical relaxation and buildup parameters. With the large polarization, we demonstrate the first13C pyruvate images with a cryogen-free MRI system operated at 1.5 T, illustrating that inexpensive hyperpolarization methods can be combined with low-cost MRI systems to obtain a broadly available, yet highly sensitive metabolic imaging platform.

ABSTRACT:
2-deoxy-2-fluorine-(18F)fluoro-d-glucose Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (18F-FDG-PET/CT) is widely used in oncology mainly for diagnosis and staging of various cancer types, including lung cancer, which is the most common cancer worldwide. Since histopathologic subtypes of lung cancer show different degree of18F-FDG uptake, to date there are some diagnostic limits and uncertainties, hindering an18F-FDG-PET-driven classification of histologic subtypes of lung cancers. On the other hand, since activated macrophages, neutrophils, fibroblasts and granulation tissues also show an increased18F-FDG activity, infectious and/or inflammatory processes and post-surgical and post-radiation changes may cause false-positive results, especially for lymph-nodes assessment. Here we propose a model-free, machine-learning based algorithm for the automated classification of adenocarcinoma, the most common type of lung cancer, and other types of tumors. Input for the algorithm are dynamic acquisitions of PET data (dPET), providing for a spatially and temporally resolved characterization of the uptake kinetic. The algorithm consists in a trained Random Forest classifier which, relying contextually on several spatial and temporal features of18F-FDG uptake, generates as an outcome probability maps allowing to distinguish adenocarcinoma from other lung histotype and to identify metastatic lymph-nodes, ultimately increasing the specificity of the technique. Its performance, evaluated on a dPET dataset of 19 patients affected by primary lung cancer, provides a probability 0.943 ± 0.090 for the detection of adenocarcinoma. The use of this algorithm will guarantee an automatic and more accurate localization and discrimination of tumors, also providing a powerful tool for detecting at which extent tumor has spread beyond a primary tumor into lymphatic system.

TITLE: Development of a ghrelin receptor inverse agonist for positron emission tomography

AUTHORS: Ralf Bergmann, Constance Chollet, Sylvia Els-Heindl, Martin Ullrich, Nicole Berndt, Jens Pietzsch, Domokos Máthé, Michael Bachmann, Annette G Beck-Sickinger

JOURNAL: Oncotarget

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Imaging of Ghrelin receptorsin vivoprovides unique potential to gain deeper understanding on Ghrelin and its receptors in health and disease, in particular, in cancer. Ghrelin, an octanoylated 28-mer peptide hormone activates the constitutively active growth hormone secretagogue receptor type 1a (GHS-R1a) with nanomolar activity. We developed novel compounds, derived from the potent inverse agonist K-(D-1-Nal)-FwLL-NH2but structurally varied by lysine conjugation with 1,4,7-triazacyclononane,1-glutaric acid-4,7-acetic acid (NODAGA), palmitic acid and/or diethylene glycol (PEG2) to allow radiolabeling and improve pharmacokinetics, respectively. All compounds were tested for receptor binding, potency and efficacyin vitro, for biodistribution and -kinetics in rats and in preclinical prostate cancer models on mice. Radiolabeling with Cu-64 and Ga-68 was successfully achieved. The Cu-64- or Ga-68-NODAGA-NH-K-K-(D-1-NaI)-F-w-L-L-NH2radiotracer were specifically accumulated by the GHS-R1a in xenotransplanted human prostate tumor models (PC-3, DU-145) in mice. The tumors were clearly delineated by PET. The radiotracer uptake was also partially blocked by K-(D-1-Nal)-FwLL-NH2in stomach and thyroid. The presence of the GHS-R1a was also confirmed by immunohistology. In the arterial rat blood plasma, only the original compounds were found. The Cu-64 or Ga-68-NODAGA-NH-K-K-(D-1-NaI)-F-w-L-L-NH2radiolabeled inverse agonists turned out to be potent and safe. Due to their easy synthesis, high affinity, medium potency, metabolic stability, and the suitable pharmacokinetic profiles, they are excellent tools for imaging and quantitation of GHS-R1a expression in normal and cancer tissues by PET. These compounds can be used as novel biomarkers of the Ghrelin system in precision medicine.

TITLE: [18F]FEDAC translocator protein positron emission tomography-computed tomography for early detection of mitochondrial dysfunction secondary to myocardial ischemia

AUTHORS: Rui Luo, Lei Wang, Fei Ye, Yan-Rong Wang, Wei Fang, Ming-Rong Zhang, Feng Wang

JOURNAL: Annals of nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Background: This study aimed to evaluate the biodistribution and kinetics of [18F]FEDAC targeting the translocator protein TSPO in the myocardium, and to explore its use for the identification of mitochondrial dysfunction. We also assessed the feasibility of [18F]FEDAC for the early detection of mitochondrial dysfunction associated with myocardial ischemia (MI).

Methods: The radiochemical purity and stability of [18F]FEDAC were analyzed by radio-high-performance liquid chromatography (radio-HPLC). Its biodistribution and kinetics were evaluated by dissection and dynamic imaging using micro-positron emission tomography-computed tomography (micro-PET-CT) in healthy mice. [18F]FEDAC was also applied in an MI rat model and in sham-operated controls. Mitochondrial changes were observed by immunohistochemical staining and electron microscopy.

Results: Radioactivity levels (%ID/g) in the myocardium in normal mice, determined by [18F]FEDAC, were 8.32 ± 0.80 at 5 min and 2.40 ± 0.10 at 60 min. PET showed significantly decreased uptake by injured cardiac tissue in MI rats, with maximal normal-to-ischemic uptake ratios of 10.47 ± 3.03 (1.5 min) and 3.92 ± 1.12 (27.5 min) (P = 0.025). Immunohistochemistry confirmed that TSPO expression was decreased in MI rats. Mitochondrial ultrastructure demonstrated significant swelling and permeability.

Conclusion: [18F]FEDAC uptake is reduced in the injured myocardium, consistent with mitochondrial dysfunction. These results may provide new evidence to aid the early detection of mitochondrial dysfunction associated with myocardial ischemic injury.

TITLE: In vitro simulated digestion and Caco-2 cell absorption to explore potential of soy protein isolates as whey protein substitutes in canine and feline food

AUTHORS: Songjun Wang, Tong Liu, Hengyan Wang, Huasong Bai, Yunliang Li, Zhanzhong Wang

JOURNAL: Veterinary research communications

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Digestive properties and bioavailability of soy protein isolate and whey protein in canine and feline were evaluated using in vitro simulated digestion and cell absorption experiments. The amino acids and peptides in soybean protein isolate and whey protein after digestion were detected by high-performance liquid chromatography and liquid mass spectrometry. Gastrointestinal digestion rates of soy protein isolate and whey protein were analyzed by fitting digestive kinetics curves. The degree of absorption and utilization of amino acids and peptides from the digestive products was evaluated by establishing a Caco-2 cell model. The results demonstrated that soy protein isolate, like whey protein, could produce large amounts of free amino acids and peptides distributed 100-1500 Da. The gastrointestinal digestion speed of soy protein isolate was similar with whey protein. It is worth noting from the intestinal absorption of Caco-2 cell that more than 15 amino acids produced by soy protein isolate and whey protein could be absorbed, and a large number of peptides were also utilized by Caco-2 cell. The bioavailability of soy protein isolates and whey protein for dogs respectively reached 6.30% and 9.00%, and it reached 7.40% and 16.40% in cats, respectively. Soy isolate proteins can be digested and absorbed by pets like whey proteins. These findings may provide significant strategies and support for the application of plant-based proteins in pet foods.

JOURNAL: Pharmaceutics

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive and malignant primary brain tumor. The blood-brain barrier (BBB) limits the therapeutic options available to tackle this incurable tumor. Transient disruption of the BBB by focused ultrasound (FUS) is a promising and safe approach to increase the brain and tumor concentration of drugs administered systemically. Non-invasive, sensitive, and reliable imaging approaches are required to better understand the impact of FUS on the BBB and brain microenvironment. In this study, nuclear imaging (SPECT/CT and PET/CT) was used to quantify neuroinflammation 48 h post-FUS and estimate the influence of FUS on BBB opening and tumor growth in vivo. BBB disruptions were performed on healthy and GBM-bearing mice (U-87 MG xenograft orthotopic model). The BBB recovery kinetics were followed and quantified by [99mTc]Tc-DTPA SPECT/CT imaging at 0.5 h, 3 h and 24 h post-FUS. The absence of neuroinflammation was confirmed by [18F]FDG PET/CT imaging 48 h post-FUS. The presence of the tumor and its growth were evaluated by [68Ga]Ga-RGD2PET/CT imaging and post-mortem histological analysis, showing that tumor growth was not influenced by FUS. In conclusion, molecular imaging can be used to evaluate the time frame for systemic treatment combined with transient BBB opening and to test its efficacy over time.

JOURNAL: Fluids and barriers of the CNS

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Background: Reduced clearance of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has been suggested as a pathological feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). With extensive documentation in non-human mammals and contradictory human neuroimaging data it remains unknown whether the nasal mucosa is a CSF drainage site in humans. Here, we used dynamic PET with [1-11C]-Butanol, a highly permeable radiotracer with no appreciable brain binding, to test the hypothesis that tracer drainage from the nasal pathway reflects CSF drainage from brain. As a test of the hypothesis, we examined whether brain and nasal fluid drainage times were correlated and affected by brain amyloid.

Methods: 24 cognitively normal subjects (≥ 65 years) were dynamically PET imaged for 60 min. using [1-11C]-Butanol. Imaging with either [11C]-PiB or [18F]-FBB identified 8 amyloid PET positive (Aβ+) and 16 Aβ- subjects. MRI-determined regions of interest (ROI) included: the carotid artery, the lateral orbitofrontal (LOF) brain, the cribriform plate, and an All-turbinate region comprised of the superior, middle, and inferior turbinates. The bilateral temporalis muscle and jugular veins served as control regions. Regional time-activity were used to model tracer influx, egress, and AUC.

Results: LOF and All-turbinate 60 min AUC were positively associated, thus suggesting a connection between the brain and the nose. Further, the Aβ+ subgroup demonstrated impaired tracer kinetics, marked by reduced tracer influx and slower egress.

Conclusion: The data show that tracer kinetics for brain and nasal turbinates are related to each other and both reflect the amyloid status of the brain. As such, these data add to evidence that the nasal pathway is a potential CSF drainage site in humans. These data warrant further investigation of brain and nasal contributions to protein clearance in neurodegenerative disease.

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is an enzyme that plays a pivotal role in peripheral inflammation and pain via the prostaglandin pathway. In the central nervous system (CNS), COX-2 is implicated in neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders as a potential therapeutic target and biomarker. However, clinical studies with COX-2 have yielded inconsistent results, partly due to limited mechanistic understanding of how COX-2 activity relates to CNS pathology. Therefore, developing COX-2 positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracers for human neuroimaging is of interest. This study introduces [11C]BRD1158, which is a potent and uniquely fast-binding, selective COX-2 PET radiotracer. [11C]BRD1158 was developed by prioritizing potency at COX-2, isoform selectivity over COX-1, fast binding kinetics, and free fraction in the brain. Evaluated through in vivo PET neuroimaging in rodent models with human COX-2 overexpression, [11C]BRD1158 demonstrated high brain uptake, fast target-engagement, functional reversibility, and excellent specific binding, which is advantageous for human imaging applications. Lastly, post-mortem samples from Huntington's disease (HD) patients and preclinical HD mouse models showed that COX-2 levels were elevated specifically in disease-affected brain regions, primarily from increased expression in microglia. These findings indicate that COX-2 holds promise as a novel clinical marker of HD onset and progression, one of many potential applications of [11C]BRD1158 human PET.

TITLE: Prediction of left lobe hypertrophy with voxel-based dosimetry using integrated Y-90 PET/MRI after radioembolization of liver tumors with Y-90 microspheres

AUTHORS: Burak Demir, Cigdem Soydal, Emre Can Celebioglu, Mehmet Sadık Bilgic, Digdem Kuru Oz, Kemal Metin Kir, Nuriye Ozlem Kucuk

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between voxel-based dosimetric variables derived from Y-90 PET/MRI and hypertrophy observed in the left lobe after radioembolization and to investigate if there is any difference in hypertrophy induced by glass versus resin microspheres.

Methods: Voxel-based dosimetry-derived variables and their relationship with the change of the standardized future liver remnant (ΔFLR) was investigated with linear regression models. To compare and evaluate the discriminatory power of the dosimetric variables, ROC analyses were utilized. ΔFLR and kinetic growth rate (KGR) induced with glass and resin microspheres were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test.

Results: In this retrospective study, data of the 40 patients treated with Y-90 microspheres were evaluated. Among the several dosimetric variables, the mean perfused volume normal tissue dose (pDnorm), perfused normal tissue V90 (pV90), and pV100 values for glass microspheres; and the mean whole liver normal tissue dose (Dnorm), pDnorm, whole liver normal tissue V30 (nV30), nV40, and pV40 for resin microspheres had the highest relationship with ΔFLR. In the ROC analysis for glass microspheres, the optimal cut-offs to predict ΔFLR > 5% were 60.55 Gy for Dnorm, 94.21 Gy for pDnorm, 28.07% for pV90, and 24.98% for pV100. For resin microspheres, corresponding values were 23.20 Gy for Dnorm, 37.40 Gy for pDnorm, 31.50% for nV30, 24.50% for nV40, and 43.60% for pV40. No significant difference was observed between glass and resin microsphere-induced median ΔFLR, KGR values and atrophy of the right lobe.

Conclusion: Following Y-90 radioembolization therapy with glass and resin microspheres applied to the right lobe of the liver, ΔFLR is correlated with pDnorm and Dnorm, but is also significantly related to various nV and pV values. In addition, the hypertrophy and kinetic growth rates observed with glass and resin microspheres were largely similar.

TITLE: The comparative energetics of the ray-finned fish in an evolutionary context

AUTHORS: Konstadia Lika, Starrlight Augustine, Sebastiaan A L M Kooijman

JOURNAL: Conservation physiology

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
To address challenges in management and conservation of fishes and fisheries it is essential to understand their life histories and energetics. The Add-my-Pet (AmP) collection of data on energetics and Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) parameters currently contains 1150 of the 40000 extant species of fish. It gives 250-280 traits per species, depending on the model type that was applied, such as maximum reserve capacity, lifespan, specific respiration and precociality index, based on which the ray-finned fish (Actinopterygii) was compared with the four other fish classes (Cyclostomata, Chondrichthyes, Actinistia, Dipnoi) and the Tetrapoda. The Actinopterygii are the only vertebrate class that shows metabolic acceleration, and clearly so in only three sub-clades. Different from chondrichthyans, quite a few species follow the waste-to-hurry strategy, especially small bodied freshwater fish such as tropical annual killifish, but also in small minnows and darters in continental climates. We briefly discuss links between waste-to-hurry, which is associated with a large specific somatic maintenance, and sensitivity for pesticides. We discuss why this interferes with the physical co-variation between maximum reserve capacity and ultimate structural length or weight and explains why maximum reserve capacity increases with body length in chondrichthyans, but not in actinopterygians. Reserve capacity has relevance, e.g. mass-specific maintenance, starvation and the kinetics of lipophyllic compounds (such as pesticides), since reserve is relatively rich in lipids in fish. Also, unlike chondrichthyans, the size at birth is very small and not linked to ultimate size; we discuss the implications. Actinopterygians allocate more to soma, compared with chondrichthyans; the latter allocate more to maturity or reproduction. Actinopterygians, Actinistia and Dipnoi are near the supply-end of the supply-demand spectrum, while chondrichthyans clearly show demand properties.

ABSTRACT:
[11C]UCB-J PET for synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2 A (SV2A) has been proposed as a suitable marker for synaptic density in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We compared [11C]UCB-J binding for synaptic density and [18F]FDG uptake for metabolism (correlated with neuronal activity) in 14 AD and 11 cognitively normal (CN) participants. We assessed both absolute and relative outcome measures in brain regions of interest, i.e.,K1orR1for [11C]UCB-J perfusion,VT(volume of distribution) orDVRto cerebellum for [11C]UCB-J binding to SV2A; andKiorKiRto cerebellum for [18F]FDG metabolism. [11C]UCB-J binding and [18F]FDG metabolism showed a similar magnitude of reduction in the medial temporal lobe of AD -compared to CN participants. However, the magnitude of reduction of [11C]UCB-J binding in neocortical regions was less than that observed with [18F]FDG metabolism. Inter-tracer correlations were also higher in the medial temporal regions between synaptic density and metabolism, with lower correlations in neocortical regions. [11C]UCB-J perfusion showed a similar pattern to [18F]FDG metabolism, with high inter-tracer regional correlations. In summary, we conducted the first in vivo PET imaging of synaptic density and metabolism in the same AD participants and reported a concordant reduction in medial temporal regions but a discordant reduction in neocortical regions.

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Sotrovimab (VIR-7831), a human IgG1κ monoclonal antibody (mAb), binds to a conserved epitope on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD). The Fc region of VIR-7831 contains an LS modification to promote neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)-mediated recycling and extend its serum half-life. Here, we aimed to evaluate the impact of the LS modification on tissue biodistribution, by comparing VIR-7831 to its non-LS-modified equivalent, VIR-7831-WT, in cynomolgus monkeys.

Methods: 89Zr-based PET/CT imaging of VIR-7831 and VIR-7831-WT was performed up to 14 days post injection. All major organs were analyzed for absolute concentration as well as tissue:blood ratios, with the focus on the respiratory tract, and a physiologically based pharmacokinetics (PBPK) model was used to evaluate the tissue biodistribution kinetics. Radiomics features were also extracted from the PET images and SUV values.

Results: SUVmeanuptake in the pulmonary bronchi for89Zr-VIR-7831 was statistically higher than for89Zr-VIR-7831-WT at days 6 (3.43 ± 0.55 and 2.59 ± 0.38, respectively) and 10 (2.66 ± 0.32 and 2.15 ± 0.18, respectively), while the reverse was observed in the liver at days 6 (5.14 ± 0.80 and 8.63 ± 0.89, respectively), 10 (4.52 ± 0.59 and 7.73 ± 0.66, respectively), and 14 (4.95 ± 0.65 and 7.94 ± 0.54, respectively). Though the calculated terminal half-life was 21.3 ± 3.0 days for VIR-7831 and 16.5 ± 1.1 days for VIR-7831-WT, no consistent differences were observed in the tissue:blood ratios between the antibodies except in the liver. While the lung:blood SUVmeanuptake ratio for both mAbs was 0.25 on day 3, the PBPK model predicted the total lung tissue and the interstitial space to serum ratio to be 0.31 and 0.55, respectively. Radiomics analysis showed VIR-7831 had mean-centralized PET SUV distribution in the lung and liver, indicating more uniform uptake than VIR-7831-WT.

Conclusion: The half-life extended VIR-7831 remained in circulation longer than VIR-7831-WT, consistent with enhanced FcRn binding, while the tissue:blood concentration ratios in most tissues for both drugs remained statistically indistinguishable throughout the course of the experiment. In the bronchiolar region, a higher concentration of89Zr-VIR-7831 was detected. The data also allow unparalleled insight into tissue distribution and elimination kinetics of mAbs that can guide future biologic drug discovery efforts, while the residualizing nature of the89Zr label sheds light on the sites of antibody catabolism.

ABSTRACT:
Receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) regulates programmed cell death and inflammation, contributing to a wide range of human pathologies, including inflammatory disorders, neurodegenerative conditions, and cancer. Despite this, no RIPK1 positron emission tomography (PET) ligand with significant in vivo specificity has been reported to date. In this work, we designed and synthesized a new family of dihydropyrazole-cored ligands suitable for18F-labeling at the late stage. Among these, WL8 showed a strong binding affinity to RIPK1 (EC50= 19.9 nM, Kd= 25 nM) and was successfully labeled with18F in the 6-position of pyridine ring, yielding a high radiochemistry yield of 27.9 % (decay-corrected) and a high molar activity of 18.8-31.2 GBq/μmol. In in vitro autoradiography, [18F]WL8 showed some specific binding in the brain sections of rats and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) model mice. Preliminary PET studies in rat brains revealed that [18F]WL8 could efficiently penetrate the blood-brain barrier and was rapidly washed out. As anticipated, [18F]WL8 exhibited a high initial uptake (brain2min= 4.80 % ID/g) in mouse brains, followed by a rapid washout (brain60min= 0.14 % ID/g), although no clear specific binding to RIPK1 was observed. Moderate in vivo stability was noted for [18F]WL8 in mouse brains with 35.2 % of the parent fraction remaining after 30 min post-administration. Altogether, our work broadens the landscape and offers a new chemotype for RIPK1 PET ligand development.

TITLE: Quantitation of the A2A Adenosine Receptor Density in the Striatum of Mice and Pigs with [18F]FLUDA by Positron Emission Tomography

ABSTRACT:
The cerebral expression of the A2Aadenosine receptor (A2AAR) is altered in neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's (PD) and Huntington's (HD) diseases, making these receptors an attractive diagnostic and therapeutic target. We aimed to further investigate the pharmacokinetic properties in the brain of our recently developed A2AAR-specific antagonist radiotracer [18F]FLUDA. For this purpose, we retrospectively analysed dynamic PET studies of healthy mice and rotenone-treated mice, and conducted dynamic PET studies with healthy pigs. We performed analysis of mouse brain time-activity curves to calculate the mean residence time (MRT) by non-compartmental analysis, and the binding potential (BPND) of [18F]FLUDA using the simplified reference tissue model (SRTM). For the pig studies, we performed a Logan graphical analysis to calculate the radiotracer distribution volume (VT) at baseline and under blocking conditions with tozadenant. The MRT of [18F]FLUDA in the striatum of mice was decreased by 30% after treatment with the A2AAR antagonist istradefylline. Mouse results showed the highest(3.9 to 5.9) in the striatum. SRTM analysis showed a 20% lower A2AAR availability in the rotenone-treated mice compared to the control-aged group. Tozadenant treatment significantly decreased theVT(14.6 vs. 8.5 mL · g-1) andBPNDvalues (1.3 vs. 0.3) in pig striatum. This study confirms the target specificity and a highBPNDof [18F]FLUDA in the striatum. We conclude that [18F]FLUDA is a suitable tool for the non-invasive quantitation of altered A2AAR expression in neurodegenerative diseases such as PD and HD, by PET.

ABSTRACT:
Liposomes are promising targeted drug delivery systems with the potential to improve the efficacy and safety profile of certain classes of drugs. Though attractive, there are unique analytical challenges associated with the development of liposomal drugs including human dose prediction given these are multi-component drug delivery systems. In this study, we developed a multimodal imaging approach to provide a comprehensive distribution assessment for an antibacterial drug, GSK2485680, delivered as a liposomal formulation (Lipo680) in a mouse thigh model of bacterial infection to support human dose prediction. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging was used to track the in vivo biodistribution of Lipo680 over 48 h post-injection providing a clear assessment of the uptake in various tissues and, importantly, the selective accumulation at the site of infection. In addition, a pharmacokinetic model was created to evaluate the kinetics of Lipo680 in different tissues. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) was then used to quantify the distribution of GSK2485680 and to qualitatively assess the distribution of a liposomal lipid throughout sections of infected and non-infected hindlimb tissues at high spatial resolution. Through the combination of both PET and MALDI IMS, we observed excellent correlation between the Lipo680-radionuclide signal detected by PET with the GSK2485680 and lipid component signals detected by MALDI IMS. This multimodal translational method can reduce drug attrition by generating comprehensive biodistribution profiles of drug delivery systems to provide mechanistic insight and elucidate safety concerns. Liposomal formulations have potential to deliver therapeutics across a broad array of different indications, and this work serves as a template to aid in delivering future liposomal drugs to the clinic.

JOURNAL: Molecular therapy oncolytics

ABSTRACT:
Success in solid tumor chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy requires overcoming several barriers, including lung sequestration, inefficient accumulation within the tumor, and target-antigen heterogeneity. Understanding CAR T-cell kinetics can assist in the interpretation of therapy response and limitations and thereby facilitate developing successful strategies to treat solid tumors. As T-cell therapy response varies across metastatic sites, the assessment of CAR T-cell kinetics by peripheral blood analysis or a single-site tumor biopsy is inadequate for interpretation of therapy response. The use of tumor imaging alone has also proven to be insufficient to interpret response to therapy. To address these limitations, we conducted dual tumor and T-cell imaging by use of a bioluminescent reporter and positron emission tomography in clinically relevant mouse models of pleural mesothelioma and non-small cell lung cancer. We observed that the mode of delivery of T cells (systemic versus regional), T-cell activation status (presence or absence of antigen-expressing tumor), and tumor-antigen expression heterogeneity influence T-cell kinetics. The observations from our study underscore the need to identify and develop a T-cell reporter-in addition to standard parameters of tumor imaging and antitumor efficacy-that can be used for repeat imaging without compromising the efficacy of CAR T cellsin vivo.

JOURNAL: Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
In the environment, plastic waste degrades into small particles known as microplastics and nanoplastics (MNPLs), depending on their size. Given the potential harmful effects associated with MNPL exposure, it is crucial to develop environmentally representative particles for hazard assessment. These so-called true-to-life MNPLs are generated through in-house degradation of real-world plastic products. In this study, we produced titanium-doped nanoplastics (NPLs) from opaque polyethylene terephthalate (PET) milk bottles, which contain titanium dioxide as a filler. The resulting PET(Ti)-NPLs were thoroughly characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), mass spectrometry (MS), dynamic light scattering (DLS), ζ-potential measurements, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Human-derived THP-1 monocytes were employed to investigate particle uptake kinetics, dosimetry, and genotoxicity. A combination of flow cytometry and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) enabled the quantification of internalized particles, while the comet assay assessed DNA damage. The results revealed dose- and time-dependent effects of PET(Ti)-NPLs on THP-1 cells, particularly in terms of internalization. Titanium doping facilitated detection and influenced genotoxic outcomes. This study demonstrates the relevance of using environmentally representative nanoplastic models for evaluating human health risks and underscores the importance of further mechanistic research.

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Demyelination, the loss of the insulating sheath of neurons, causes failed or slowed neuronal conduction and contributes to the neurological symptoms in multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain and spinal cord injuries, stroke, and dementia. In demyelinated neurons, the axonal potassium channels Kv1.1 and Kv1.2, generally under the myelin sheath, become exposed and upregulated. Therefore, imaging these channels using positron emission tomography can provide valuable information for disease diagnosis and monitoring. Here, we describe a novel tracer for Kv1 channels, [11C]3-methyl-4-aminopyridine ([11C]3Me4AP). [11C]3Me4AP was efficiently synthesized via Pd(0)-Cu(I) comediated Stille cross-coupling of a stannyl precursor containing a free amino group. Evaluation of its imaging properties in rats and nonhuman primates showed that [11C]3Me4AP has a moderate brain permeability and slow kinetics. Additional evaluation in monkeys showed that the tracer is metabolically stable and that a one-tissue compartment model can accurately model the regional brain time-activity curves. Compared to the related tracers [18F]3-fluoro-4-aminopyridine ([18F]3F4AP) and [11C]3-methoxy-4-aminopyridine ([11C]3MeO4AP), [11C]3Me4AP shows lower initial brain uptake, which indicates reduced permeability to the blood-brain barrier and slower kinetics, suggesting higher binding affinity consistent within vitrostudies. While the slow kinetics and strong binding affinity resulted in a tracer with less favorable properties for imaging the brain than its predecessors, these properties may make 3Me4AP useful as a therapeutic.

JOURNAL: Molecular cancer therapeutics

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
The enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect controls passive nanodrug uptake in tumors and may provide a high tumor payload with prolonged retention for cancer treatment. However, EPR-mediated tumor uptake and distribution vary by cancer phenotype. Thus, we hypothesized that a companion PET imaging surrogate may benefit EPR-mediated therapeutic drug delivery. We developed two 89Zr-radiolabeled nanocarriers based on 4-armed starPEG40kDa with or without talazoparib (TLZ), a potent PARP inhibitor, as surrogates for the PEG-TLZ4 therapeutic scaffold. For PET imaging, PEG-DFB4 and PEG-DFB1-TLZ3 were radiolabeled with 89Zr by replacing one or all four copis of TLZ on PEG-TLZ4 with deferoxamine B (DFB). The radiolabeled nanodrugs [89Zr]PEG-DFB4 and [89Zr]PEG-DFB1-TLZ3 were tested in vivo in prostate cancer subcutaneous (s.c.) xenografts (22Rv1, LTL-545, and LTL-610) and 22Rv1 metastatic models. Their EPR-mediated tumoral uptake and penetration was compared with CT26, a known EPR-high cell line. MicroPET/CT images, organ biodistribution, and calculated kinetic parameters showed high uptake in CT26 and LTL-545 and moderate to low uptake in LTL-610 and 22Rv1. MicroPET/CT and high-resolution autoradiographic images showed nanocarrier penetration into highly permeable CT26, but heterogeneous peripheral accumulation was observed in LTL-545, LTL-610, and 22Rv1 s.c. xenografts and metastatic tumors. CD31 staining of tumor sections showed homogenous vascular development in CT26 tumors and heterogeneity in other xenografts. Both [89Zr]PEG-DFB4 and [89Zr]PEG-DFB1-TLZ3 showed similar accumulation and distribution in s.c. and metastatic tumor models. Both nanocarriers can measure tumor model passive uptake heterogeneity. Although heterogeneous, prostate cancer xenografts had low EPR. These starPEG nanocarriers could be used as PET imaging surrogates to predict drug delivery and efficacy.

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: To determine the fitting equation that can correct for the underestimation of myocardial blood flow (MBF) measurement by using dynamic CT perfusion (CTP) with dual-source CT (MBFCT), using MBF with oxygen 15-labeled water (15O-water) PET (MBFPET) as a reference, and to determine the accuracy of corrected MBFCT(MBFCT-corrected) compared with MBFPETin a separate set of participants.

Materials and methods: In this prospective study (reference no. 2466), 34 participants (mean age, 70 years ± 8 [standard deviation]; 27 men) known or suspected to have coronary artery disease underwent dynamic stress CTP and stress15O-water PET between January 2014 and December 2018. The participants were randomly assigned to either a pilot group (n= 17), to determine the fitting equation on the basis of the generalized Renkin-Crone model that can explain the relation between MBFCTand MBFPET, or to a validation group (n= 17), to validate MBFCT-correctedcompared with MBFPET. The agreement between MBFCT-correctedand MBFPETwas evaluated by intraclass correlation and Bland-Altman analysis.

Results: In the pilot group, MBFCTwas lower than MBFPET(1.24 mL/min/g ± 0.28 vs 2.51 mL/min/g ± 0.89,P< .001) at the segment level. The relationship between MBFCTand MBFCT-correctedwas represented as MBFCT= MBFCT-corrected× {1-exp[-(0.11 × MBFCT-corrected+ 1.54)/MBFCT-corrected]}. In the validation group, MBFCT-correctedwas 2.66 mL/min/g ± 1.93, and MBFPETwas 2.68 mL/min/g ± 1.87 at the vessel level. MBFCT-correctedshowed an excellent agreement with MBFPET(intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.93 [95% CI: 0.87, 0.96]). The measurement bias of MBFCT-correctedand MBFPETwas -0.02 mL/min/g ± 0.74.

Conclusion: Underestimation of MBF by CT was successfully corrected with a correction method that was based on contrast kinetics in the myocardium.Keywords:CT, CT-Perfusion, PET, Cardiac, HeartSupplemental material is available for this article.© RSNA, 2021.

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Synaptic abnormalities are associated with many brain disorders. Recently, we developed a novel synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A) radiotracer [18F]SynVesT-1 and demonstrated its excellent imaging and binding properties in nonhuman primates. The aim of this study was to perform dosimetry calculations in nonhuman primates and to evaluate this tracer in humans and assess its test-retest reliability in comparison with [11C]UCB-J.

Methods: Three rhesus monkeys underwent whole body dynamic PET scanning to estimate the absorbed dose. PET scans in six healthy human subjects were acquired. Time-activity curves (TACs) were generated with defined regions of interest (ROI). Reproducibility of distribution volume (VT) values and its sensitivity to scan duration were assessed with the one-tissue compartment (1TC) model. Non-displaceable binding potential (BPND) was calculated using centrum semiovale as the reference region.

Results: The dosimetry study showed high uptake in the urinary bladder and brain. In humans, [18F]SynVesT-1 displayed high uptake with maximum SUV of ~10 and appropriate kinetics with a quick rise in tracer uptake followed by a gradual clearance. Mean 1TC VTvalues (mL/cm3) ranged from 3.4 (centrum semiovale) to 19.6 (putamen) and were similar to those of [11C]UCB-J. Regional BPNDvalues were 2.7-4.7 in gray matter areas, and mean BPNDvalues across all ROIs were ~ 21% higher than those of [11C]UCB-J. The absolute test-retest variability of VTand BPNDwas excellent (< 9%) across all brain regions.

Conclusions: [18F]SynVesT-1 demonstrates outstanding characteristics in humans: fast and high brain uptake, appropriate tissue kinetics, high levels of specific binding, and excellent test-retest reproducibility of binding parameters. As such, [18F]SynVesT-1 is proved to be a favorable radiotracer for SV2A imaging and quantification in humans.

TITLE: Deconvolution of Plasma Pharmacokinetics from Dynamic Heart Imaging Data Obtained by Single Positron Emission Computed Tomography/Computed Tomography Imaging

JOURNAL: The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Plasma pharmacokinetic (PK) data are required as an input function for graphical analysis of single positron emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) and positron emission tomography/CT (PET/CT) data to evaluate tissue influx rate of radiotracers. Dynamic heart imaging data are often used as a surrogate of plasma PK. However, accumulation of radiolabel in the heart tissue may cause overprediction of plasma PK. Therefore, we developed a compartmental model, which involves forcing functions to describe intact and degraded radiolabeled proteins in plasma and their accumulation in heart tissue, to deconvolve plasma PK of125I-amyloid beta 40 (125I-Aβ40) and125I-insulin from their dynamic heart imaging data. The three-compartment model was shown to adequately describe the plasma concentration-time profile of intact/degraded proteins and the heart radioactivity time data obtained from SPECT/CT imaging for both tracers. The model was successfully applied to deconvolve the plasma PK of both tracers from their naïve datasets of dynamic heart imaging. In agreement with our previous observations made by conventional serial plasma sampling, the deconvolved plasma PK of125I-Aβ40and125I-insulin in young mice exhibited lower area under the curve than aged mice. Further, Patlak plot parameters extracted using deconvolved plasma PK as input function successfully recapitulated age-dependent plasma-to-brain influx kinetics changes. Therefore, the compartment model developed in this study provides a novel approach to deconvolve plasma PK of radiotracers from their noninvasive dynamic heart imaging. This method facilitates the application of preclinical SPECT/PET imaging data to characterize distribution kinetics of tracers where simultaneous plasma sampling is not feasible. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Knowledge of plasma pharmacokinetics (PK) of a radiotracer is necessary to accurately estimate its plasma-to-brain influx. However, simultaneous plasma sampling during dynamic imaging procedures is not always feasible. In the current study, we developed approaches to deconvolve plasma PK from dynamic heart imaging data of two model radiotracers,125I-amyloid beta 40 (125I-Aβ40) and125I-insulin. This novel method is expected to minimize the need for conducting additional plasma PK studies and allow for accurate estimation of the brain influx rate.

JOURNAL: Molecular pharmaceutics

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
[11C]ER176 has adequate sensitivity to image the human brain translocator protein (TSPO) in all three genotypes by positron emission tomography (PET). However, its clinical application is limited by the short half-life of11C (20.38 min). To overcome the deficiency of [11C]ER176 and keep the pharmacophore features of ER176 to the maximum extent, we designed four fluorine-labeled ER176 derivatives using the deuterium method. In vitro competition binding confirmed that the designed compounds had high affinity for TSPO. Biodistribution experiments showed that tissues with high expression of TSPO had high uptake of these compounds, as well as that the compound showed high brain penetration and mild defluorination in vivo. Therefore, [18F]BIBD-239 with simple synthesis conditions was selected for further biological evaluation. Theoretical simulations showed that BIBD-239 and ER176 have similar binding modes and sites to Ala147-TSPO and Thr147-TSPO, which indicated that the tracers may have consistent sensitivity to the three affinity genotypes. In vitro autoradiography and in vivo PET studies of the ischemic rat brain showed dramatically higher uptake of [18F]BIBD-239 on the lesion site compared to the contralateral side with good brain kinetics. Additionally, [18F]BIBD-239 provided clear tumor PET images in a GL261 glioma model. Importantly, PET imaging and liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) results showed that in vivo defluorination and other metabolites of [18F]BIBD-239 did not interfere with brain imaging. Conclusively, [18F]BIBD-239, similar to ER176 with low polymorphism sensitivity, has simple labeling conditions, high labeling yield, high affinity, and high specificity for TSPO, and it is planned for further evaluation in higher species.

TITLE: Vertical and seasonal variations in biofilm formation on plastic substrates in coastal waters of the Black Sea

AUTHORS: Mukhanov Vladimir, Rauen Tatiana, Sakhon Evgeniy, Subramanian Veerasingam, Andrei Bagaev

JOURNAL: Chemosphere

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Plastic contamination of the marine environment is an increasing concern worldwide. Therefore, it is important to understand the kinetics of biofilms on plastics to study their behavior, fate, and transport pathways in the ocean. In this study, the vertical and seasonal variations in biofouling formation on transparent polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic fragments in the Southwest Crimea coastal waters of the Black Sea were investigated. Biofilms were identified in the transient light as 'dark spots' on the plastic surface, for which the numbers, size, and area were measured using specialized software. The rate of biofouling in the surface water layer was lower than those found in the middle and near-bottom water column, which could be due to a damaging effect of turbulent mixing on the biofilm. The highest rates of biofouling and diverse community were observed during the summer. The epibiotic assembly was represented by diatoms (11 taxa), dinoflagellates (3 taxa), green algae, filamentous cyanobacteria, small flagellates, and ciliates. Significant differences between the biofouling rates observed in different seasons made it difficult to estimate the period of time the plastic substrate has been in the marine environment. It was proposed to use the green alga Phycopeltis arundinacea (Montgn) De Tender et al., 2015 as a bioindicator to study the age of the biofouling community. Discoid thalli were identified at all stages of colonization of the plastic fragments in different seasons. Results obtained in this study demonstrate that biofouling organisms may be good model organisms in revealing age of biofilm formation and longevity of plastic debris in the ocean. Consequently, it is proposed that such biofouling organisms could be used as target species to monitor the biodegradation of plastic debris.

TITLE: N-(4-[18F]fluorobenzyl)cholylglycine, a potential tracer for positron emission tomography of enterohepatic circulation and drug-induced inhibition of ileal bile acid transport. A proof-of-concept PET/CT study in pigs

AUTHORS: Kim Frisch, Frank Viborg Mortensen, Ole Lajord Munk, Lars Christian Gormsen, Aage Kristian Olsen Alstrup

JOURNAL: Nuclear medicine and biology

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Introduction: Enterohepatic circulation (EHC) of conjugated bile acids is an important physiological process crucial for bile acids to function as detergents and signal carriers. Perturbation of the EHC by disease or drugs may lead to serious and life-threatening liver and gastrointestinal disorders. In this proof-of-concept study in pigs, we investigate the potential of N-(4-[18F]fluorobenzyl)cholylglycine ([18F]FBCGly) as tracer for quantitative positron emission tomography (PET) of the EHC of conjugated bile acids.

Methods: The biodistribution of [18F]FBCGly was investigated by PET/CT in domestic pigs following intravenous and intraileal administration of the tracer. Hepatic kinetics were estimated from PET and blood data using a 2-tissue compartmental model and dual-input of [18F]FBCGly. The ileal uptake of [18F]FBCGly was investigated with co-injection of nifedipine and endogenous cholyltaurine. Dosimetry was estimated from the PET data using the Olinda 2.0 software. Blood, bile and urine samples were analyzed for possible fluorine-18 labelled metabolites of [18F]FBCGly.

Results: [18F]FBCGly was rapidly taken up by the liver and excreted into bile, and underwent EHC without being metabolized. Both nifedipine and endogenous cholyltaurine inhibited the ileal uptake of [18F]FBCGly. The flow-dependent hepatic uptake clearance was estimated to median 1.2 mL blood/min/mL liver tissue. The mean residence time of [18F]FBCGly in hepatocytes was 4.0 ± 1.1 min. Critical organs for [18F]FBCGly were the gallbladder wall (0.94 mGy/MBq) and the small intestine (0.50 mGy/MBq). The effective dose for [18F]FBCGly was 36 μSv/MBq.

Conclusion: We have shown that [18F]FBCGly undergoes EHC in pigs without being metabolized and that its ileal uptake is inhibited by nifedipine and endogenous bile acids. Combined with our previous findings in rats, we believe that [18F]FBCGly has potential as PET tracer for assessment of EHC of conjugated bile acids under physiological conditions as well as conditions with perturbed hepatic and ileal bile acid transport.

ABSTRACT:
Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with radiotracers that bind to fibrillary amyloid β (Aβ) deposits is an important tool for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and for the recruitment of patients into clinical trials. However, it has been suggested that rather than the fibrillary Aβ deposits, it is smaller, soluble Aβ aggregates that exert a neurotoxic effect and trigger AD pathogenesis. The aim of the current study is to develop a PET probe that is capable of detecting small aggregates and soluble Aβ oligomers for improved diagnosis and therapy monitoring. An18F-labeled radioligand was prepared based on the Aβ-binding d-enantiomeric peptide RD2, which is currently being evaluated in clinical trials as a therapeutic agent to dissolve Aβ oligomers.18F-labeling was carried out using palladium-catalyzed S-arylation of RD2 with 2-[18F]fluoro-5-iodopyridine ([18F]FIPy). Specific binding of [18F]RD2-cFPy to brain material from transgenic AD (APP/PS1) mice and AD patients was demonstrated with in vitro autoradiography. In vivo uptake and biodistribution of [18F]RD2-cFPy were evaluated using PET analyses in wild-type and transgenic APP/PS1 mice. Although brain penetration and brain wash-out kinetics of the radioligand were low, this study provides proof of principle for a PET probe based on a d-enantiomeric peptide binding to soluble Aβ species.

TITLE: Development of Novel PET-PAN Electrospun Nanocomposite Membrane Embedded with Layered Double Hydroxides Hybrid for Efficient Wastewater Treatment

AUTHORS: Abdul Majeed Pirzada, Imran Ali, Nabi Bakhsh Mallah, Ghulamullah Maitlo

JOURNAL: Polymers

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) with their unique structural chemistry create opportunities to be modified with polymers, making different nanocomposites. In the current research, a novel PET-PAN embedded with Mg-AI-LDH-PVA nanocomposite membrane was fabricated through electrospinning. SEM, EDX, FTIR, XRD, and AFM were carried out to investigate the structure and morphology of the nanocomposite membrane. The characterization of the optimized nanocomposite membrane showed a beadless, smooth structure with a nanofiber diameter of 695 nm. The water contact angle and tensile strength were 16° and 1.4 Mpa, respectively, showing an increase in the hydrophilicity and stability of the nanocomposite membrane by the addition of Mg-Al-LDH-PVA. To evaluate the adsorption performance of the nanocomposite membrane, operating parameters were achieved for Cr(VI) and methyl orange at pH 2.0 and pH 4.0, respectively, including contact time, adsorbate dose, and pollutant concentration. The adsorption data of the nanocomposite membrane showed the removal of 68% and 80% for Cr(VI) and methyl orange, respectively. The process of adsorption followed a Langmuir isotherm model that fit well and pseudo-2nd order kinetics with R2values of 0.97 and 0.99, respectively. The recycling results showed the membrane's stability for up to five cycles. The developed membrane can be used for efficient removal of pollutants from wastewater.

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Rabbit bucks (bodyweight 5 kg) underwent dietary intoxication with fumonisin B series mycotoxins (FB1+ FB2+ FB3, 15 mg/kg diet) for 14 days to test the applicability of positron emission tomography-magnetic resonance (PET MR) hybrid imaging in characterizing experimentally induced mild hepatotoxicosis.18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) radiotracer-aided imaging was performed before and after FBs administration on identical animals, and at both time points, blood was sampled for haematology and clinical chemistry. Kinetic PET image analysis revealed time-activity curves with uptake maxima below 1 min in the liver, renal cortex, portal vein, lung and coarctatio aortae. In the frame of static PET image analysis, based on the standardized uptake value (SUV), the so-called metabolic liver volume (MLV, liver volume defined by over 0.9 × average liver SUV) and the total liver glycolysis (TLG, MLV multiplied by the SUVmean) were calculated. Mycotoxicosis increased total liver glycolysis (p < 0.04) after 14 days and liver tissue TLG inhomogeneity was minimal. Pearson correlation between TLG and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) was positive (0.515), while negative with LDH and AST (- 0.721 and - 0.491, respectively). Results indicate a slight hepatic mycotoxin effect and significantly increased glucose uptake intensity, which has been sensitively detected with molecular imaging (18F-FDG PET MRI) in the rabbit model.

TITLE: Replacement of tibialis cranialis tendon with polyester, silicone-coated artificial tendon preserves biomechanical function in rabbits compared to tendon excision only

AUTHORS: Katrina L Easton, Carter Hatch, Kaitlyn Stephens, Dylan Marler, Obinna Fidelis, Xiaocun Sun, Kristin M Bowers, Caroline Billings, Cheryl B Greenacre, David E Anderson, Dustin L Crouch

JOURNAL: Journal of orthopaedic surgery and research

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Background: Artificial tendons may be an effective alternative to autologous and allogenic tendon grafts for repairing critically sized tendon defects. The goal of this study was to quantify the in vivo hindlimb biomechanics (ground contact pressure and sagittal-plane motion) during hopping gait of rabbits having a critically sized tendon defect of the tibialis cranialis and either with or without repair using an artificial tendon.

Methods: In five rabbits, the tibialis cranialis tendon of the left hindlimb was surgically replaced with a polyester, silicone-coated artificial tendon (PET-SI); five operated control rabbits underwent complete surgical excision of the biological tibialis cranialis tendon in the left hindlimb with no replacement (TE).

Results: At 8 weeks post-surgery, peak vertical ground contact force in the left hindlimb was statistically significantly less compared to baseline for the TE group (p = 0.0215). Statistical parametric mapping (SPM) analysis showed that, compared to baseline, the knee was significantly more extended during stance at 2 weeks post-surgery and during the swing phase of stride at 2 and 8 weeks post-surgery for the TE group (p < 0.05). Also, the ankle was significantly more plantarflexed during swing at 2 and 8 weeks postoperative for the TE group (p < 0.05). In contrast, there were no significant differences in the SPM analysis among timepoints in the PET-SI group for the knee or ankle.

Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the artificial tibialis cranialis tendon effectively replaced the biomechanical function of the native tendon. Future studies should investigate (1) effects of artificial tendons on other (e.g., neuromuscular) tissues and systems and (2) biomechanical outcomes when there is a delay between tendon injury and artificial tendon implantation.

TITLE: Waste PET Plastic-Derived UIO-66(Zr)-MOF Adsorbent for Dispersive Solid Phase Extraction and Removal of Penicillin Antibiotics Water Systems

AUTHORS: Inga Skans, Mthokozisi Mnguni, Philiswa Nosizo Nomngongo

JOURNAL: Analytical science advances

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
The extensive use or misuse of broad-spectrum antibiotics such as penicillins and their existence in various water bodies is still one of increasing global concern due to their persistent nature, which could potentially lead to human health and environmental risks. Recycling or upcycling plastic waste to value-added products such as metal-organic frameworks (MOF) to solve other environmental problems, such as water pollution, has received more attention. As a result, UiO-66(Zr)-MOF derived from recycled waste PET bottles (PET-derived UiO-66(Zr)-MOF) was investigated for enrichment and removal of amoxicillin (AMX) and penicillin G (PNG) in water bodies. The synthesised adsorbent was characterised using different analytical characterisation techniques. UiO-66(Zr)-MOF produced the maximum adsorption capacities of 139 and 147 mg/g for AMX and PNG, respectively. Freundlich and pseudo-second-order kinetics models best explained the adsorption process. The dispersive micro-solid phase extraction (D-μ-SPE) of the target analytes was performed using a high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detector (HPLC-DAD). The effectiveness of the developed method was confirmed by its remarkable analytical performances, such as limits of detection (0.19-0.21 µg/L) while the linear range was 0.6-1000 µg/L. The feasibility and applicability of the validated UiO-66(Zr)-MOF-D-μ-SPE/HPLC-DAD method were confirmed by applying it in real water analysis. The AMX and PNG were detected in wastewater samples in the ranges of 1.51-4.71 µg/L and 0.195-1.19 µg/L for influent and effluent. The spike recoveries ranged from 89.9% to 101%, while the precision (intraday and interday) of the method was less than 5%.

TITLE: Improving the In Vivo Stability of [52Mn]Mn(II) Complexes with 18-Membered Macrocyclic Chelators for PET Imaging

AUTHORS: Charlene Harriswangler, James M Omweri, Shefali Saini, Laura Valencia, David Esteban-Gómez, Madalina Ranga, Nicol Guidolin, Zsolt Baranyai, Suzanne E Lapi, Carlos Platas-Iglesias

JOURNAL: Journal of medicinal chemistry

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
We report the [natMn/52Mn]Mn(II) complexes of the macrocyclic chelators PYAN [3,6,10,13-tetraaza-1,8(2,6)-dipyridinacyclotetradecaphane] and CHXPYAN [(41R,42R,101R,102R)-3,5,9,11-tetraaza-1,7(2,6)-dipyridina-4,10(1,2)-dicyclohexanacyclododecaphane]. The X-ray crystal structures of Mn-PYAN and Mn-CHXPYAN evidence distorted octahedral geometries through coordination of the nitrogen atoms of the macrocycles. Cyclic voltammetry studies evidence reversible processes due to the Mn(II)/Mn(III) pair, indicating that the complexes are resistant to oxidation. CHXPYAN forms a more thermodynamically stable and kinetically inert Mn(II) complex than PYAN. Radiochemical studies with the radioactive isotope manganese-52 (52Mn,t1/2= 5.6 days) evidenced better radiochemical yields for CHXPYAN than for PYAN. Both [52Mn]Mn(II) complexes remained stable in mouse and human serum, so in vivo stability studies were carried out. Positron emission tomography/computed tomography scans and biodistribution assays indicated that [52Mn]Mn-PYAN has a distribution pattern similar to that of [52Mn]MnCl2, showing persistent radioactivity accumulation in the kidneys. Conversely, [52Mn]Mn-CHXPYAN remained stable in vivo, clearing quickly from the liver and kidneys.

JOURNAL: Journal of labelled compounds & radiopharmaceuticals

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Pharmaceutical grade 3'-deoxy-3'-[18F]fluorothymidine [18F]FLT was synthesized using 3-N-Boc-5'-O-dimethoxytrityl-3'-O-nosyl-thymidine (BOC-Nosyl) precursor, in the general purpose TRACERlab FX modules. Purification of [18F]FLT, via solid phase extraction (SPE) after radiosynthesis, using a combination of different SPE cartridges, yielded satisfactory results, with radiochemical and chemical purity >99%. While the non-decay corrected radiochemical yield (RCY) with 20 mg (24 μmole) of BOC-Nosyl precursor was found to be 6.80 ± 0.16%, the decay corrected radiochemical yield (RCY) was 9.95 ± 0.24%. Residual acetone, acetonitrile, and ethanol levels were found to be 22.97 ± 0.76, 109.08 ± 0.93, and 7,666.45 ± 3.7 ppm, respectively. A simplified method for solid-phase purification of [18F]FLT was developed, circumventing the need for HPLC purification. Biodistribution in C57BL/6 mice with B16F10 cell line-induced melanoma showed tumor to blood ratio of ~3.8 at 90 min. PET/CT imaging of normal rabbit injected with [18F]FLT shows selective uptake in the bone marrow and small intestine. [18F]FLT was found to be excreted through the kidneys and get collected in the urinary bladder, 120 min post injection. PET/CT imaging performed in rabbit model at 30, 60, 90, and 120 min post [18F]FLT injections showed concordance with tissue distribution kinetics of mice tumor model.

TITLE: An Improved Synthesis of N-(4-[18F]Fluorobenzoyl)-Interleukin-2 for the Preclinical PET Imaging of Tumour-Infiltrating T-cells in CT26 and MC38 Colon Cancer Models

AUTHORS: Shivashankar Khanapur, Fui Fong Yong, Siddesh V Hartimath, Lingfan Jiang, Boominathan Ramasamy, Peter Cheng, Pradeep Narayanaswamy, Julian L Goggi, Edward George Robins

JOURNAL: Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of activated T-cells withN-(4-[18F]fluorobenzoyl)-interleukin-2 ([18F]FB-IL-2) may be a promising tool for patient management to aid in the assessment of clinical responses to immune therapeutics. Unfortunately, existing radiosynthetic methods are very low yielding due to complex and time-consuming chemical processes. Herein, we report an improved method for the synthesis of [18F]FB-IL-2, which reduces synthesis time and improves radiochemical yield. With this optimized approach, [18F]FB-IL-2 was prepared with a non-decay-corrected radiochemical yield of 3.8 ± 0.7% from [18F]fluoride, 3.8 times higher than previously reported methods. In vitro experiments showed that the radiotracer was stable with good radiochemical purity (>95%), confirmed its identity and showed preferential binding to activated mouse peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Dynamic PET imaging and ex vivo biodistribution studies in naïve Balb/c mice showed organ distribution and kinetics comparable to earlier published data on [18F]FB-IL-2. Significant improvements in the radiochemical manufacture of [18F]FB-IL-2 facilitates access to this promising PET imaging radiopharmaceutical, which may, in turn, provide useful insights into different tumour phenotypes and a greater understanding of the cellular nature and differential immune microenvironments that are critical to understand and develop new treatments for cancers.

JOURNAL: Journal of medicinal chemistry

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Receptor-interacting serine/threonine protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) has emerged as an important regulator of pathologic cell death and inflammation and is implicated in the pathologies of various central nervous system diseases. In this study, we reported the development of three potent dihydropyrazole-cored RIPK1 positron emission tomography (PET) ligands [18F]WL1-3. Among these, [18F]WL1showed specific binding to RIPK1 in mouse brain sectionsin vitrothrough autoradiography and exhibited favorable brain kinetics in mice, characterized by a high initial uptake (brain2 min= 4.89% ID/g) and rapid washout (brain60 min= 0.21% ID/g). PET studies in rat brains revealed that [18F]WL1could readily penetrate the brain with specific binding confirmed by inhibition effects of unlabeledWL1and GSK'547. Notably, [18F]WL1showed significant potential in imaging the alterations of RIPK1 in a rat brain of tumor necrosis factor α-induced systemic inflammatory response syndrome model. These findings may pave the way for the future design of potent RIPK1 PET ligands.

TITLE: Inflammatory Activity in Atelectatic and Normally Aerated Regions During Early Acute Lung Injury

AUTHORS: Takuga Hinoshita, Gabriel Motta Ribeiro, Tilo Winkler, Nicolas de Prost, Mauro R Tucci, Eduardo Leite Vieira Costa, Tyler J Wellman, Soshi Hashimoto, Congli Zeng, Alysson R Carvalho, Marcos Francisco Vidal Melo

JOURNAL: Academic radiology

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Rationale and objectives: Pulmonary atelectasis presumably promotes and facilitates lung injury. However, data are limited on its direct and remote relation to inflammation. We aimed to assess regional 2-deoxy-2-[18F]-fluoro-D-glucose (18F-FDG) kinetics representative of inflammation in atelectatic and normally aerated regions in models of early lung injury.

Materials and methods: We studied supine sheep in four groups: Permissive Atelectasis (n = 6)-16 hours protective tidal volume (VT) and zero positive end-expiratory pressure; Mild (n = 5) and Moderate Endotoxemia (n = 6)- 20-24 hours protective ventilation and intravenous lipopolysaccharide (Mild = 2.5 and Moderate = 10.0 ng/kg/min), and Surfactant Depletion (n = 6)-saline lung lavage and 4 hours high VT. Measurements performed immediately after anesthesia induction served as controls (n = 8). Atelectasis was defined as regions of gas fraction <0.1 in transmission or computed tomography scans.18F-FDG kinetics measured with positron emission tomography were analyzed with a three-compartment model.

Results: 18F-FDG net uptake rate in atelectatic tissue was larger during Moderate Endotoxemia (0.0092 ± 0.0019/min) than controls (0.0051 ± 0.0014/min, p = 0.01).18F-FDG phosphorylation rate in atelectatic tissue was larger in both endotoxemia groups (0.0287 ± 0.0075/min) than controls (0.0198 ± 0.0039/min, p = 0.05) while the18F-FDG volume of distribution was not significantly different among groups. Additionally, normally aerated regions showed larger18F-FDG uptake during Permissive Atelectasis (0.0031 ± 0.0005/min, p < 0.01), Mild (0.0028 ± 0.0006/min, p = 0.04), and Moderate Endotoxemia (0.0039 ± 0.0005/min, p < 0.01) than controls (0.0020 ± 0.0003/min).

Conclusion: Atelectatic regions present increased metabolic activation during moderate endotoxemia mostly due to increased18F-FDG phosphorylation, indicative of increased cellular metabolic activation. Increased18F-FDG uptake in normally aerated regions during permissive atelectasis suggests an injurious remote effect of atelectasis even with protective tidal volumes.

TITLE: Evaluation of Integrin αvβ3 Expression in Murine Xenograft Models: [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-C(RGDfK) PET Study with Immunohistochemical Confirmation

AUTHORS: Kosuke Mitsuyuki, Tadashi Watabe, Sadahiro Naka, Yuwei Liu, Mitsuaki Tatsumi, Eku Shimosegawa, Hiroki Kato

JOURNAL: Diagnostics (Basel, Switzerland)

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Tumor blood flow (TBF) is related to drug delivery and hypoxia, both of which can impact the efficacy of anti-cancer therapies. Although integrin αvβ3expression is related to tumor angiogenesis, it remains unclear whether the degree of angiogenesis affects TBF. This study aimed to evaluate the expression of integrin αvβ3in mouse tumor models using [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-c(RGDfK) peptide positron emission tomography (PET) and immunohistochemical staining. PET studies were conducted using mouse C6 glioma models and MIA PaCa-2 (n= 6 each). The [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-c(RGDfK) peptide was injected via the tail vein (2.17 ± 0.28 MBq), and 10 min static PET scans were performed. Immunohistochemical analysis was conducted using an integrin αVβ3antibody. [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-c(RGDfK) peptide PET revealed higher uptake of the radiotracer in C6 gliomas than in MIA PaCa-2 tumors. The mean standardized uptake value was significantly higher in C6 gliomas (0.35 ± 0.058) than in MIA PaCa-2 tumors (0.17 ± 0.045). Histological analysis revealed intense integrin αVβ3expression in the C6 gliomas, whereas the MIA PaCa-2 tumors had low expression levels. This study showed that the expression of integrin αvβ3can be differentiated by the [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-c(RGDfK) peptide, suggesting the potential applicability of this peptide in the evaluation of the relationship between angiogenesis and TBF.

TITLE: Evaluation of cellular water exchange in a mouse glioma model using dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI with two flip angles

AUTHORS: Karl Kiser, Jin Zhang, Ayesha Bharadwaj Das, James A Tranos, Youssef Zaim Wadghiri, Sungheon Gene Kim

JOURNAL: Scientific reports

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
This manuscript aims to evaluate the robustness and significance of the water efflux rate constant (kio) parameter estimated using the two flip-angle Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced (DCE) MRI approach with a murine glioblastoma model at 7 T. The repeatability of contrast kinetic parameters and kiomeasurement was assessed by a test-retest experiment (n = 7). The association of kiowith cellular metabolism was investigated through DCE-MRI and FDG-PET experiments (n = 7). Tumor response to a combination therapy of bevacizumab and fluorouracil (5FU) monitored by contrast kinetic parameters and kio(n = 10). Test-retest experiments demonstrated compartmental volume fractions (veand vp) remained consistent between scans while the vascular functional measures (Fpand PS) and kioshowed noticeable changes, most likely due to physiological changes of the tumor. The standardized uptake value (SUV) of tumors has a linear correlation with kio(R2= 0.547), a positive correlation with Fp(R2= 0.504), and weak correlations with ve(R2= 0.150), vp(R2= 0.077), PS (R2= 0.117), Ktrans(R2= 0.088) and whole tumor volume (R2= 0.174). In the treatment study, the kioof the treated group was significantly lower than the control group one day after bevacizumab treatment and decreased significantly after 5FU treatment compared to the baseline. This study results support the feasibility of measuring kiousing the two flip-angle DCE-MRI approach in cancer imaging.

JOURNAL: Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Lead halide perovskite nanocrystals of the formula CsPbBr3have recently been identified as potential time taggers in scintillating heterostructures for time-of-flight positron emission tomography (TOF-PET) imaging thanks to their ultrafast decay kinetics. This study investigates the potential of this material experimentally. We fabricated CsPbBr3thin films on scintillating GGAG:Ce (Gd2.985Ce0.015Ga2.7Al2.3O12) wafer as a model structure for the future sampling detector geometry. We focused this study on the radioluminescence (RL) response of this composite material. We compare the results of two spin-coating methods, namely the static and the dynamic process, for the thin film preparation. We demonstrated enhanced RL intensity of both CsPbBr3and GGAG:Ce scintillating constituents of a composite material. This synergic effect arises in both the RL spectra and decays, including decays in the short time window (50 ns). Consequently, this study confirms the applicability of CsPbBr3nanocrystals as efficient time taggers for ultrafast timing applications, such as TOF-PET.

AUTHORS: Yuka Otaki, Serge D Van Kriekinge, Chih-Chun Wei, Paul Kavanagh, Ananya Singh, Tejas Parekh, Marcelo Di Carli, Jamshid Maddahi, Arkadiusz Sitek, Christopher Buckley, Daniel S Berman, Piotr J Slomka

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: We sought to evaluate the diagnostic performance for coronary artery disease (CAD) of myocardial blood flow (MBF) quantification with18F-flurpiridaz PET using motion correction (MC) and residual activity correction (RAC).

Methods: In total, 231 patients undergoing same-day pharmacologic rest and stress18F-flurpiridaz PET from Phase III Flurpiridaz trial (NCT01347710) were studied. Frame-by-frame MC was performed and RAC was accomplished by subtracting the rest residual counts from the dynamic stress polar maps. MBF and myocardial flow reserve (MFR) were derived with a two-compartment early kinetic model for the entire left ventricle (global), each coronary territory, and 17-segment. Global and minimal values of three territorial (minimal vessel) and segmental estimation (minimal segment) of stress MBF and MFR were evaluated in the prediction of CAD. MBF and MFR were evaluated with and without MC and RAC (1: no MC/no RAC, 2: no MC/RAC, 3: MC/RAC).

Results: The area-under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC [95% confidence interval]) of stress MBF with MC/RAC was higher for minimal segment (0.89 [0.85-0.94]) than for minimal vessel (0.86 [0.81-0.92], p = 0.03) or global estimation (0.81 [0.75-0.87], p < 0.0001). The AUC of MFR with MC/RAC was higher for minimal segment (0.87 [0.81-0.93]) than for minimal vessel (0.83 [0.76-0.90], p = 0.014) or global estimation (0.77 [0.69-0.84], p < 0.0001). The AUCs of minimal segment stress MBF and MFR with MC/RAC were higher compared to those with no MC/RAC (p < 0.001 for both) or no MC/no RAC (p < 0.0001 for both).

Conclusions: Minimal segment MBF or MFR estimation with MC and RAC improves the diagnostic performance for obstructive CAD compared to global assessment.

JOURNAL: ACS chemical neuroscience

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
NLX-204, a highly selective biased agonist for serotonin 5-HT1Areceptors, demonstrates strong affinity and preferentially elicits ERK1/2 phosphorylation, a response linked to antidepressant activity. Preclinical studies in rodent models confirm its potential as an effective and rapid-acting treatment for depression. In the present study, we performed a pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characterization of NLX-204 by means of neuroimaging techniques. Radiolabeling of NLX-204 with fluorine-18 was used to assess its brain distribution and labeling kinetics via PET microdosing imaging in rats. Its pharmacodynamics were further investigated through a dose-response study in awake, freely moving rats using functional ultrasound (fUS) imaging. This unique combination of PET and fUS brain imaging data demonstrates that NLX-204 specifically engages 5-HT1Areceptors in the rat brain, eliciting robust activation in specific cortical regions. These results support the potential of NLX-204 as a promising candidate for the treatment of mood disorders.

ABSTRACT:
Monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) is a 33 kDa serine protease primarily responsible for hydrolyzing 2-arachidonoylglycerol into the proinflammatory eicosanoid precursor arachidonic acid in the central nervous system. Inhibition of MAGL constitutes an attractive therapeutic concept for treating psychiatric disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. Herein, we present the design and synthesis of multiple reversible MAGL inhibitor candidates based on a piperazinyl azetidine scaffold. Compounds10and15were identified as the best-performing reversible MAGL inhibitors by pharmacological evaluations, thus channeling their radiolabeling with fluorine-18 in high radiochemical yields and favorable molar activity. Furthermore, evaluation of [18F]10and [18F]15([18F]MAGL-2102) by autoradiography and positron emission tomography (PET) imaging in rodents and nonhuman primates demonstrated favorable brain uptakes, heterogeneous radioactivity distribution, good specific binding, and adequate brain kinetics, and [18F]15demonstrated a better performance. In conclusion, [18F]15was found to be a suitable PET radioligand for the visualization of MAGL, harboring potential for the successful translation into humans.

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Pancreatic cancer is a malignant tumor with a high degree of malignancy, strong heterogeneity, and high lethality. Trop2 is a transmembrane glycoprotein associated with the occurrence, development, and poor prognosis of pancreatic cancer. This study aims to develop64Cu/177Lu-labeled anti-Trop2 monoclonal antibody (hIMB1636) for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and radioimmunotherapy (RIT) application in pancreatic cancer tumor models.

Methods: The binding kinetics of hIMB1636 to Trop2 antigen was measured by Biolayer interferometry (BLI). Western blotting was used to screen the Trop2 expression of pancreatic cancer cell lines. Flow cytometry and cell immunofluorescence were used to evaluate the binding ability of hIMB1636 and Trop2 on the cell surface. hIMB1636 were conjugated with p-SCN-Bn-NOTA (NOTA) and DOTA-NHS-ester (DOTA) for64Cu and177Lu radiolabeling respectively. ImmunoPET imaging and RIT studies were performed using64Cu-NOTA-hIMB1636 and177Lu-DOTA-hIMB1636 in subcutaneous pancreatic cancer tumor models.

Results: hIMB1636 had a strong binding affinity to Trop2 according to the results of BLI. The T3M-4 cell line showed the strongest expression of Trop2 and specific binding ability of hIMB1636 according to the results of Western blotting, flow cytometry, and cell immunofluorescence. The radiochemical purity of64Cu-NOTA-hIMB1636 and177Lu-DOTA-hIMB1636 exceeded 95%. PET imaging showed gradually an accumulation of64Cu-NOTA-hIMB1636 in T3M-4 tumor models. The maximum tumor uptake was 8.95 ± 1.07%ID/g (n = 4) at 48 h post injection (p.i.), which had significant differences with T3M-4-blocked and PaTu8988-negative groups (P < 0.001). The high-177Lu-hIMB1636 group demonstrated the strongest tumor suppression with standardized tumor volume about 94.24 ± 14.62% (n = 5) at 14 days p.i., significantly smaller than other groups (P < 0.05). Ex vivo biodistribution and histological staining verified the in vivo PET imaging and RIT results.

Conclusions: This study demonstrated that64Cu/177Lu-labeled hIMB1636 could noninvasively evaluate the expression level of Trop2 and inhibit the Trop2-overexpressed tumor growth in pancreatic cancer tumor models. Further clinical evaluation and translation of Trop2-targeted drug may be of great help in the stratification and management of pancreatic cancer patients.

JOURNAL: Metabolic syndrome and related disorders

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Background:Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a severe form of fatty liver disease that has been shown to be associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Mechanism for the association of NASH with CKD remains unclear. In this study, we examined the association between NASH severity and kidney glucose uptake and the liver-secreted signaling molecule fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21).Methods:Kinetic parameters for kidney glucose transport rate (K1) and standardized uptake value (SUV) were determined using dynamic positron emission tomography after injection of18F-fluorodeoxyglucose. Liver biopsies were scored for NASH activity (inflammation and ballooning), fibrosis, and steatosis FGF21 was measured from fasting serum samples. Patients were categorized by liver biopsy and multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate the associations.Results:Of 41 NASH patients 73% were females, 71% white, 51% with steatosis ≥2, 39% with NASH activity ≥4 and fibrosis ≥3. With severe NASH activity, kidney SUV significantly increased even when adjusted for underlying insulin-resistant (IR) state. Kidney K1decreased significantly in higher liver activity in unadjusted models but not when adjusted for IR. FGF21 decreased with severe liver activity in adjusted models (P< 0.05) and associated with kidney K1 but not SUV.Conclusion:Our pilot data indicate that kidney glucose metabolism associates with NASH activity and FGF21 levels, suggesting a potential mechanism to NASH-induced CKD.

ABSTRACT:
Immuno-PET/CT imaging, a branch of molecular imaging, can noninvasively and specifically visualize biomarker expression across the body. Trophoblast cell surface antigen 2 (Trop2) is a pan-cancer biomarker and plays a crucial role in tumorigenesis through multiple signaling pathways. The study aims to develop and translate novel Trop2 single-domain antibody (sdAb) tracers for clinical use.Methods:Two sdAbs (i.e., His-tagged T4 and His-tag-free RT4) are recombinantly expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. The purities and binding kinetics are determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, high-performance liquid chromatography, and surface plasmon resonance assays. The AlF restrained complexing agent (RESCA) method is applied to develop18F-labeled sdAb tracers ([18F]AlF-RESCA-T4 and [18F]AlF-RESCA-RT4), followed by thorough preclinical imaging and blocking studies on tumor-bearing mice and a pilot clinical trial evaluating the clinical imaging safety and feasibility of [18F]AlF-RESCA-T4 immuno-PET/CT.Results:[18F]AlF-RESCA-T4 and [18F]AlF-RESCA-RT4 possess high radiochemical purities. Preclinical imaging in the T3M-4 tumor model revealed prominent uptake (percentage injected dose/g) of [18F]AlF-RESCA-T4 (11.13 ± 1.53,n= 4) and [18F]AlF-RESCA-RT4 (8.83 ± 1.22,n= 4), which were significantly reduced by coinjection of unlabeled T4 and RT4 in blocking studies. The His-tag removal strategy further optimized the probe's in vivo pharmacokinetics and reduced renal radioactivity accumulation without significantly decreasing tumor uptake. In a pilot clinical trial, [18F]AlF-RESCA-T4 immuno-PET/CT showed promising potency in annotating Trop2 expression and differentiating tumors from inflammatory diseases such as tuberculosis.Conclusion:[18F]AlF-RESCA-T4 and [18F]AlF-RESCA-RT4 can specifically annotate Trop2 expression. Clinical [18F]AlF-RESCA-T4 immuno-PET/CT imaging can screen patients for Trop2-targeted therapies and differentiate lung inflammation from cancer.

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs) play a pivotal role in tumor metabolic symbiosis, acid resistance, and metastatic progression. Herein, we report the development of [18F]FEtO-CHC, a novel MCTs-targeted positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer, and systematically evaluate its potential for non-invasive tumor imaging.

Procedures: The radiosynthesis of [18F]FEtO-CHC and its non-radioactive analog was achieved through optimized precursor synthesis and fluorination protocols. Comprehensive in vitro characterization encompassed: radiochemical purity and stability assessments, cellular uptake kinetics and inhibition assays in MCT-expressing BxPC3 (pancreatic) and 4T1 (breast) cancer models, biodistribution and dynamic micro-PET/CT imaging in tumor-bearing murine models.

Results: [18F]FEtO-CHC, a CHC-derived radioligand, was synthesized via streamlined one-step radiosynthesis with 52.08 ± 6.74% decay-corrected yield (n=7), >99% radiochemical purity, and excellent stability. Cellular studies demonstrated MCTs-dependent uptake with significant suppression (>70%) by α-CHC competition. In vivo pharmacokinetics revealed favorable metabolic stability with dual hepatorenal clearance. Tumor uptake correlated with MCT expression levels, as confirmed by immunohistochemistry.

Conclusions: This study establishes an efficient one-step radiosynthetic approach for [18F]FEtO-CHC production and validates its specificity as a MCT-targeted PET probe, offering potential utility in tumor imaging with further structural optimization.

TITLE: In vivo imaging translocator protein (TSPO) in autism spectrum disorder

AUTHORS: Dominic Simpson, Avideh Gharehgazlou, Tania Da Silva, Charlotte Labrie-Cleary, Alan A Wilson, Jeffrey H Meyer, Romina Mizrahi, Pablo M Rusjan

JOURNAL: Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology

ABSTRACT:
Converging evidence points to the significant involvement of the immune system in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Positron emission tomography (PET) can quantify translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO), a marker with increased expression mainly in microglia and, to some extent astroglia during neuropsychiatric diseases with inflammation. This preliminary analysis explored, for the first time, whether TSPO binding was altered in male and female participants with ASD in vivo using full kinetic quantification. Thirteen individuals with ASD (IQ > 70 [n = 12], IQ = 62 [n = 1]), 5 F, 25 ± 5 years) were scanned with [18F]FEPPA PET. Data from 13 typically developing control participants with matching age and TSPO rs6971 polymorphism (9 F, age 24 ± 5 years) were chosen from previous studies for comparison. The two tissue compartment model (2TCM) was used to determine the total volume of distribution ([18F]FEPPA VT) in four previously identified regions of interest (ROI): prefrontal, temporal, cerebellar, and anterior cingulate cortices. We observe no significant difference in [18F]FEPPA VTrelative to controls (F(1,26)= 1.74, p = 0.20). However, 2 ASD participants with higher VThad concurrent major depressive episodes (MDE), which has been consistently reported during MDE. After excluding those 2 ASD participants, in a post-hoc analysis, our results show lower [18F]FEPPA VTin ASD participants compared to controls (F(1,24)= 6.62, p = 0.02). This preliminary analysis provides evidence suggesting an atypical neuroimmune state in ASD.

ABSTRACT:
Background The PET tracer (4S)-4-(3-[18F]fluoropropyl)-l-glutamate (18F-FSPG) targets the system xC-cotransporter, which is overexpressed in various tumors. Purpose To assess the role of18F-FSPG PET/CT in intracranial malignancies. Materials and Methods Twenty-six patients (mean age, 54 years ± 12; 17 men; 48 total lesions) with primary brain tumors (n= 17) or brain metastases (n= 9) were enrolled in this prospective, single-center study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier:NCT02370563) between November 2014 and March 2016. A 30-minute dynamic brain18F-FSPG PET/CT scan and a static whole-body (WB)18F-FSPG PET/CT scan at 60-75 minutes were acquired. Moreover, all participants underwent MRI, and four participants underwent fluorine 18 (18F) fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET imaging. PET parameters and their relative changes were obtained for all lesions. Kinetic modeling was used to estimate the18F-FSPG tumor rate constants using the dynamic and dynamic plus WB PET data. Imaging parameters were correlated to lesion outcomes, as determined with follow-up MRI and/or pathologic examination. The Mann-WhitneyUtest or Studentttest was used for group mean comparisons. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used for performance comparison of different decision measures. Results18F-FSPG PET/CT helped identify all 48 brain lesions. The mean tumor-to-background ratio (TBR) on the whole-brain PET images at the WB time point was 26.6 ± 24.9 (range: 2.6-150.3). When18F-FDG PET was performed,18F-FSPG permitted visualization of non-18F-FDG-avid lesions or allowed better lesion differentiation from surrounding tissues. In participants with primary brain tumors, the predictive accuracy of the relative changes in influx rate constant Kiand maximum standardized uptake value to discriminate between poor and good lesion outcomes were 89% and 81%, respectively. There were significant differences in the18F-FSPG uptake curves of lesions with good versus poor outcomes in the primary brain tumor group (P< .05) but not in the brain metastases group. Conclusion PET/CT imaging with (4S)-4-(3-[18F]fluoropropyl)-l-glutamate (18F-FSPG) helped detect primary brain tumors and brain metastases with a high tumor-to-background ratio. Relative changes in18F-FSPG uptake with multi-time-point PET appear to be helpful in predicting lesion outcomes.

JOURNAL: ACS sustainable chemistry & engineering

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Plastic and biomass waste pose a serious environmental risk; thus, herein, we mixed biomass waste with plastic bottle waste (PET) to produce char composite materials for producing a magnetic char composite for better separation when used in water treatment applications. This study also calculated the life cycle environmental impacts of the preparation of adsorbent material for 11 different indicator categories. For 1 functional unit (1 kg of pomace leaves as feedstock), abiotic depletion of fossil fuels and global warming potential were quantified as 7.17 MJ and 0.63 kg CO2equiv for production of magnetic char composite materials. The magnetic char composite material (MPBC) was then used to remove crystal violet dye from its aqueous solution under various operational parameters. The kinetics and isotherm statistical theories showed that the sorption of CV dye onto MPBC was governed by pseudo-second-order, and Langmuir models, respectively. The quantitative assessment of sorption capacity clarifies that the produced MPBC exhibited an admirable ability of 256.41 mg g-1. Meanwhile, the recyclability of 92.4% of MPBC was demonstrated after 5 adsorption/desorption cycles. Findings from this study will inspire more sustainable and cost-effective production of magnetic sorbents, including those derived from combined plastic and biomass waste streams.

TITLE: Molecular Imaging and Theragnostics of Thyroid Cancers

JOURNAL: Cancers

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Molecular imaging plays an important role in the evaluation and management of different thyroid cancer histotypes. The existing risk stratification models can be refined, by incorporation of tumor-specific molecular markers that have theranostic power, to optimize patient-specific (individualized) treatment decisions. Molecular imaging with varying radioisotopes of iodine (i.e.,131I,123I,124I) is an indispensable component of dynamic and theragnostic risk stratification of differentiated carcinoma (DTC) while [18F]F-fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) helps in addressing disease aggressiveness, detects distant metastases, and risk-stratifies patients with radioiodine-refractory DTC, poorly differentiated and anaplastic thyroid cancers. For medullary thyroid cancer (MTC), a neuroendocrine tumor derived from thyroid C-cells, [18F]F-dihydroxyphenylalanine (6-[18F]FDOPA) PET/CT and/or [18F]FDG PET/CT can be used dependent on serum markers levels and kinetics. In addition to radioiodine therapy for DTC, some theragnostic approaches are promising for metastatic MTC as well. Moreover, new redifferentiation strategies are now available to restore uptake in radioiodine-refractory DTC while new theragnostic approaches showed promising preliminary results for advanced and aggressive forms of follicular-cell derived thyroid cancers (i.e., peptide receptor radiotherapy). In order to help clinicians put the role of molecular imaging into perspective, the appropriate role and emerging opportunities for molecular imaging and theragnostics in thyroid cancer are discussed in our present review.

ABSTRACT:
This study was aimed at evaluating the metabolism of reactive astrocytes in the brains of patients with multiple sclerosis by quantitative 1-C-11 acetate positron emission tomography (PET). Magnetic resonance imaging and 1-C-11 quantitative PET were performed in eight patients with multiple sclerosis and 10 normal control subjects. The efflux rate (k2) of 1-C-11 acetate, which reportedly reflects the metabolic rate of 1-C-11 acetate, was calculated based on the one-tissue compartmental model. Fractional anisotropy was also determined to evaluate the integrity of the neuronal tracts. The values of k2 in the patients with multiple sclerosis were significantly higher than those in the normal control subjects, in both the white matter (p= 0.003) and the gray matter (p= 0.02). In addition, the white matter/gray matter ratio of k2 was significantly higher in the multiple sclerosis patients than in the normal control subjects (p= 0.02). Voxel-based statistical analysis revealed most prominent increase in k2 in the neuronal fiber tracts, as well as decrease in fractional anisotropy in them in the multiple sclerosis patients. The present study clarified that the pathological changes associated with astrocytic reactivation in multiple sclerosis patients could be visualized by quantitative 1-C-11 acetate PET.

JOURNAL: Frontiers in cardiovascular medicine

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Introduction and objectives: Wound healing after myocardial infarction (MI) is a dynamic and complex multiple phase process, and a coordinated cellular response is required for proper scar formation. The current paradigm suggests that pro-inflammatory monocytes infiltrate the MI zone during the initial pro-inflammatory phase and differentiate into inflammatory macrophages, and then switch their phenotypes to anti-inflammatory during the reparative phase. Visualization of the reparative phase post-MI is of great interest because it may reveal delayed resolution of inflammation, which in turn predicts adverse cardiac remodeling. Imaging of anti-inflammatory macrophages may also be used to assess therapy approaches aiming to modulate the inflammatory response in order to limit MI size. Reparative macrophages can be distinguished from inflammatory macrophages by the surface marker mannose receptor (MR, CD206). In this study we evaluated the feasibility of68Ga-NOTA-anti-MMR Nb for imaging of MR on alternatively activated macrophages in murine MI models.

Methods: Wildtype and MR-knockout mice and Wistar rats were subjected to MI via permanent ligation of the left coronary artery. Non-operated or sham-operated animals were used as controls. MR expression kinetics on cardiac macrophages was measured in mice using flow cytometry. PET/CT scans were performed 1 h after intravenous injection of68Ga-NOTA-anti-MMR Nb. Mice and rats were euthanized and hearts harvested forex vivoPET/MRI, autoradiography, and staining. As a non-targeting negative control,68Ga-NOTA-BCII10 was used.

Results: In vivo-PET/CT scans showed focal radioactivity signals in the infarcted myocardium for68Ga-NOTA-anti-MMR Nb which were confirmed byex vivo-PET/MRI scans. In autoradiography images, augmented uptake of the tracer was observed in infarcts, as verified by the histochemistry analysis. Immunofluorescence staining demonstrated the presence and co-localization of CD206- and CD68-positive cells, in accordance to infarct zone. Noin vivoorex vivosignal was observed in the animals injected with control Nb or in the sham-operated animals.68Ga-NOTA-anti-MMR Nb uptake in the infarcts of MR-knockout mice was negligibly low, confirming the specificity of68Ga-NOTA-anti-MMR Nb to MR.

Conclusion: This exploratory study highlights the potential of68Ga-NOTA-anti-MMR Nb to image MR-positive macrophages that are known to play a pivotal role in wound healing that follows acute MI.

JOURNAL: Bioorganic chemistry

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
A library of new phenstatin based indole linked chalcone compounds (9a-z and 9aa-ad) were designed and synthesized. Of these, compound 9a with 1-methyl, 2- and 3-methoxy substituents in the aromatic ring was efficacious against the human oral cancer cell line SCC-29B, spheroids, and in a mouse xenograft model of oral cancer AW13516. Compound 9a exhibited anti-cancer activity through disrupting cellular integrity and affecting glucose metabolism-which is a hallmark of cancer. The cellular architecture was affected by inhibition of tubulin polymerization as observed by an immunofluorescence assay on 9a-treated SCC-29B cells. An in vitro tubulin polymerization kinetics assay provided evidence of direct interaction of 9a with tubulin. This physical interaction between tubulin and compound 9a was further confirmed by Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) analysis. Molecular docking experiments and validations revealed that compound 9a interacts and binds at the colchicine binding site of tubulin and at active sites of key enzymes in the glucose metabolism pathway. Based on in silico modeling, biophysical interactions, and pre-clinical observations, 9a consisting of phenstatin based indole-chalcone scaffolds, can be considered as an attractive tubulin polymerization inhibitor candidate for developing anti-cancer therapeutics.

TITLE: A prior information-based multi-population multi-objective optimization for estimating 18F-FDG PET/CT pharmacokinetics of hepatocellular carcinoma

AUTHORS: Yiwei Xiong, Siming Li, Jianfeng He, Shaobo Wang

JOURNAL: BMC medical imaging

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Background: 18F fluoro-D-glucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) pharmacokinetics is an approach for efficiently quantifying perfusion and metabolic processes in the liver, but the conventional single-individual optimization algorithms and single-population optimization algorithms have difficulty obtaining reasonable physiological characteristics from estimated parameters. A prior-based multi-population multi-objective optimization (p-MPMOO) approach using two sub-populations based on two categories of prior information was preliminarily proposed for estimating the18F-FDG PET/CT pharmacokinetics of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.

Methods: PET data from 24 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumors of 5-min dynamic PET/CT supplemented with 1-min static PET at 60 min were prospectively collected. A reversible double-input three-compartment model and kinetic parameters (K1, k2, k3, k4, fa, and [Formula: see text]) were used to quantify the metabolic information. The single-individual Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm, single-population algorithms (Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Differential Evolution (DE), and Genetic Algorithm (GA)) and p-MPMO optimization algorithms (p-MPMOPSO, p-MPMODE, and p-MPMOGA) were used to estimate the parameters.

Results: The areas under the curve (AUCs) of the three p-MPMO methods were significantly higher than other methods in K1and k4(P < 0.05 in the DeLong test) and the single population optimization in k2and k3(P < 0.05), and did not differ from other methods in faand vb(P > 0.05). Compared with single-population optimization, the three p-MPMO methods improved the significant differences between K1, k2, k3, and k4. The p-MPMOPSO showed significant differences (P < 0.05) in the parameter estimation of k2, k3, k4, and fa. The p-MPMODE is implemented on K1, k2, k3, k4, and fa; The p-MPMOGA does it on all six parameters.

Conclusions: The p-MPMOO approach proposed in this paper performs well for distinguishing HCC tumors from normal liver tissue.

TITLE: Preclinical evaluation of (S)-[18F]GE387, a novel 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO) PET radioligand with low binding sensitivity to human polymorphism rs6971

AUTHORS: Nisha K Ramakrishnan, Matthew Hird, Stephen Thompson, David J Williamson, Luxi Qiao, David R Owen, Allen F Brooks, Peter J H Scott, Sergio Bacallado, John T O'Brien, Franklin I Aigbirhio

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Positron emission tomography (PET) studies with radioligands for 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO) have been instrumental in increasing our understanding of the complex role neuroinflammation plays in disorders affecting the brain. However, (R)-[11C]PK11195, the first and most widely used TSPO radioligand has limitations, while the next-generation TSPO radioligands have suffered from high interindividual variability in binding due to a genetic polymorphism in the TSPO gene (rs6971). Herein, we present the biological evaluation of the two enantiomers of [18F]GE387, which we have previously shown to have low sensitivity to this polymorphism.

Methods: Dynamic PET scans were conducted in male Wistar rats and female rhesus macaques to investigate the in vivo behaviour of (S)-[18F]GE387 and (R)-[18F]GE387. The specific binding of (S)-[18F]GE387 to TSPO was investigated by pre-treatment with (R)-PK11195. (S)-[18F]GE387 was further evaluated in a rat model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neuroinflammation. Sensitivity to polymorphism of (S)-GE387 was evaluated in genotyped human brain tissue.

Results: (S)-[18F]GE387 and (R)-[18F]GE387 entered the brain in both rats and rhesus macaques. (R)-PK11195 blocked the uptake of (S)-[18F]GE387 in healthy olfactory bulb and peripheral tissues constitutively expressing TSPO. A 2.7-fold higher uptake of (S)-[18F]GE387 was found in the inflamed striatum of LPS-treated rodents. In genotyped human brain tissue, (S)-GE387 was shown to bind similarly in low affinity binders (LABs) and high affinity binders (HABs) with a LAB to HAB ratio of 1.8.

Conclusion: We established that (S)-[18F]GE387 has favourable kinetics in healthy rats and non-human primates and that it can distinguish inflamed from normal brain regions in the LPS model of neuroinflammation. Crucially, we have reconfirmed its low sensitivity to the TSPO polymorphism on genotyped human brain tissue. Based on these factors, we conclude that (S)-[18F]GE387 warrants further evaluation with studies on human subjects to assess its suitability as a TSPO PET radioligand for assessing neuroinflammation.

TITLE: Adsorption of tetracycline and Cd(II) on polystyrene and polyethylene terephthalate microplastics with ultraviolet and hydrogen peroxide aging treatment

AUTHORS: Hua Wang, Cheng Qiu, Yali Song, Shaochen Bian, Qun Wang, Yongmin Chen, Chengran Fang

JOURNAL: The Science of the total environment

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Microplastics (MPs) could serve as vectors of antibiotics and heavy metals through sorption and desorption. However, the combined adsorption process of antibiotics and heavy metals on aged MPs has rarely been studied. In this study, combined adsorption/desorption of tetracycline (TC) and Cd(II) on/from polystyrene (PS) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) MPs, as well as ultraviolet (UV) and H2O2aged MPs, was investigated. The specific surface areas of the MPs increased after UV and H2O2aging. Adsorption experiments showed that the pseudo-second-order kinetic model and Freundlich model fitted adsorption of TC and Cd(II) on all of the MPs. The adsorption capacities of TC and Cd(II) were higher on aged MPs than on the pristine MPs, especially on H2O2treated MPs. TC adsorption on the MPs was hardly affected by Cd(II), and Cd(II) adsorption was not significantly affected by TC when the solution pH value was below 8.0. Cd(II) slightly enhanced TC adsorption on the MPs at pH 8.0, especially on the aged MPs. The TC adsorption capacities increased with increasing pH, reaching a maximum at pH 5.0 or 6.0, and they then decreased, while the largest level of Cd(II) adsorption was at approximately pH 6.0. Adsorption of TC and Cd(II) on the pristine and aged MPs was thermodynamically favorable and spontaneous. The trend of the desorption rates of TC and Cd(II) from the MPs in different background solutions was ultrapure water < surface water < simulated gastric fluid. The desorption rates of TC and Cd(II) from the aged MPs were lower than those from the pristine MPs. The results revealed the mechanism of the TC and Cd(II) combined adsorption process on aged MPs, which will provide insight for understanding the aging process and its potential effects on sorption and desorption of antibiotics and heavy metals in the real environment.

TITLE: Simulation of the cyclic voltammetric response of an outer-sphere redox species with inclusion of electrical double layer structure and ohmic potential drop

AUTHORS: Katherine J Levey, Martin A Edwards, Henry S White, Julie V Macpherson

JOURNAL: Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
A finite-element model has been developed to simulate the cyclic voltammetric (CV) response of a planar electrode for a 1e outer-sphere redox process, which fully accounts for cell electrostatics, including ohmic potential drop, ion migration, and the structure of the potential-dependent electric double layer. Both reversible and quasi-reversible redox reactions are treated. The simulations compute the time-dependent electric potential and ion distributions across the entire cell during a voltammetric scan. In this way, it is possible to obtain the interdependent faradaic and non-faradaic contributions to a CV and rigorously include all effects of the electric potential distribution on the rate of electron transfer and the local concentrations of the redox species Ozand Rz-1. Importantly, we demonstrate that the driving force for electron transfer can be different to the applied potential when electrostatic interactions are included. We also show that the concentrations of Ozand Rz-1at the plane of electron transfer (PET) significantly depart from those predicted by the Nernst equation, even when the system is characterised by fast electron transfer/diffusion control. A mechanistic rationalisation is also presented as to why the electric double layer has a negligible effect on the CV response of such reversible systems. In contrast, for quasi-reversible electron transfer the concentrations of redox species at the PET are shown to play an important role in determining CV wave shape, an effect also dependant on the charge of the redox species and the formal electrode potential of the redox couple. Failure to consider electrostatic effects could lead to incorrect interpretation of electron-transfer kinetics from the CV response. Simulated CVs at scan rates between 0.1 and 1000 V s-1are found to be in good agreement with experimental data for the reduction of 1.0 mM Ru(NH3)63+at a 2 mm diameter gold disk electrode in 1.0 M potassium nitrate.

TITLE: Toward Novel [18F]Fluorine-Labeled Radiotracers for the Imaging of α-Synuclein Fibrils

AUTHORS: Bright C Uzuegbunam, Junhao Li, Wojciech Paslawski, Wolfgang Weber, Per Svenningsson, Hans Ågren, Behrooz Hooshyar Yousefi

JOURNAL: Frontiers in aging neuroscience

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
The accumulation of α-synuclein aggregates (α-syn) in the human brain is an occurrence common to all α-synucleinopathies. Non-invasive detection of these aggregates in a living brain with a target-specific radiotracer is not yet possible. We have recently discovered that the inclusion of a methylenedioxy group in the structure of diarylbisthiazole (DABTA)-based tracers improves binding affinity and selectivity to α-syn. Subsequently, complementaryin silicomodeling and machine learning (ML) of tracer-protein interactions were employed to predict surface sites and structure-property relations for the binding of the ligands. Based on this observation, we developed a small focused library of DABTAs from which 4-(benzo[d][1,3]dioxol-5-yl)-4'-(3-[18F]fluoro-4-methoxyphenyl)-2,2'-bithiazole[18F]d2, 6-(4'-(3-[18F]fluoro-4-methoxyphenyl)-[2,2'-bithiazol]-4-yl)-[1,3]dioxolo[4,5-b]pyridine[18F]d4, 4-(benzo [d][1,3]dioxol-5-yl)-4'-(6-[18F]fluoropyridin-3-yl)-2,2'-bithiazole[18F]d6, and 6-(4'-(6-[18F]fluoropyridin-3-yl)-[2,2'-bithiazol]-4-yl)-[1,3]dioxolo[4,5-b]pyridine[18F]d8were selected based on their high binding affinity to α-syn and were further evaluated. Binding assay experiments carried out with the non-radioactive versions of the above tracersd2,d4,d6, andd8showed high binding affinity of the ligands to α-syn: 1.22, 0.66, 1.21, and 0.10 nM, respectively, as well as excellent selectivity over β-amyloid plaques (Aβ) and microtubular tau aggregates (>200-fold selectivity). To obtain the tracers, their precursors were radiolabeled eitherviaan innovative ruthenium-mediated (SNAr) reaction ([18F]d2and[18F]d4) or typical SNAr reaction ([18F]d6and[18F]d8) with moderate-to-high radiochemical yields (13% - 40%), and high molar activity > 60 GBq/μmol. Biodistribution experiments carried out with the tracers in healthy mice revealed that[18F]d2and[18F]d4showed suboptimal brain pharmacokinetics: 1.58 and 4.63 %ID/g at 5 min post-injection (p.i.), and 1.93 and 3.86 %ID/g at 60 min p.i., respectively. However,[18F]d6and[18F]d8showed improved brain pharmacokinetics: 5.79 and 5.13 %ID/g at 5 min p.i.; 1.75 and 1.07 %ID/g at 60 min p.i.; and 1.04 and 0.58 %ID/g at 120 min p.i., respectively. The brain uptake kinetics of[18F]d6and[18F]d8were confirmed in a dynamic PET study. Both tracers also showed no brain radiometabolites at 20 min p.i. in initialin vivostability experiments carried out in healthy mice.[18F]d8seems very promising based on its binding properties andin vivostability, thus encouraging further validation of its usefulness as a radiotracer for thein vivovisualization of α-syn in preclinical and clinical settings. Additionally,in silicoand ML-predicted values correlated with the experimental binding affinity of the ligands.

ABSTRACT:
We have previously developed seven fluorinated analogues of A-836339 as new PET tracers for cannabinoid type 2 receptor (CB2R) imaging, among which (Z)-N-(3-(2-(2-[18F]fluoroethoxy)ethyl)-4,5-dimethylthiazol-2(3H)-ylidene)-2,2,3,3-tetramethylcyclopropane-1-carboxamide ([18F]FC0324) displayed high affinity and selectivity for CB2R in healthy rats. In the present study, we have further evaluated the imaging and metabolic properties of [18F]FC0324 in a rat model of human CB2R overexpression in the brain (AAV-hCB2) and in non-human primates (NHPs). Autoradiography with AAV-hCB2rat brain sections exhibited a signal of [18F]FC0324 8-fold higher in the ipsilateral region than in the contralateral region. Blocking with NE40, a CB2R-specific agonist, resulted in a 91% decrease in the radioactivity. PET experiments showed a signal 7-fold higher in the ipsilateral region, and the specificity of [18F]FC0324 forhCB2R in vivo was confirmed by the 80% decrease after blocking with NE40. In NHPs, brain time-activity curves displayed a fast and homogeneous distribution followed by a rapid washout, in accordance with the low amount of CB2Rs in healthy brain. Whole-body PET-CT suggested a high and specific uptake of the radiotracer in the spleen, a CB2R-rich organ, and in the organs involved in metabolism and excretion, with a low bone uptake. In vitro metabolism with monkey liver microsomes (MLMs) led to the formation of six main hydroxylated metabolites of FC0324. Five of them were produced by human liver microsomes, being much less active than MLMs. In vivo, in NHPs, the main radiometabolite was likely to result from further oxidation of hydroxylated compounds, and parent [18F]FC0324 accounted for 8 ± 3% of plasma radioactivity (at 120 min p.i.) with a low level of potential interfering radiometabolites. Furthermore, this metabolism should be significantly reduced in humans due to species differences. In conclusion, [18F]FC0324 appears to be a promising candidate for further human studies with suitable kinetics, selectivity, and metabolic profile for CB2R PET imaging.

TITLE: Modeling the Enhanced Efficacy and Curing Depth of Photo-Thermal Dual Polymerization in Metal (Fe) Polymer Composites for 3D Printing

AUTHORS: Jui-Teng Lin, Yi-Ze Lee, Jacques Lalevee, Chia-Hung Kao, Kuan-Han Lin, Da-Chuan Cheng

JOURNAL: Polymers

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
This article presents, for the first time, the efficacy and curing depth analysis of photo-thermal dual polymerization in metal (Fe) polymer composites for 3D printing of a three-component (A/B/M) system based on the proposed mechanism of our group, in which the co initiators A and B are Irgacure-369 and charge-transfer complexes (CTC), respectively, and the monomer M is filled by Fe. Our formulas show the depth of curing (Zc) is an increasing function of the light intensity, but a decreasing function of the Fe and photoinitiator concentrations. Zc is enhanced by the additive [B], which produces extra thermal radical for polymerization under high temperature. The heat (or temperature) increase in the system has two components: (i) due to the light absorption of Fe filler and (ii) heat released from the exothermic photopolymerization of the monomer. The heat is transported to the additive (or co-initiator) [B] to produce extra radicals and enhance the monomer conversion function (CF). The Fe filler leads to a temperature increase but also limits the light penetration, leading to lower CF and Zc, which could be overcome by the additive initiator [B] in thick polymers. Optimal Fe for maximal CF and Zc are explored theoretically. Measured data are analyzed based on our derived formulas.

TITLE: Radiosynthesis of 1-(2-[18F]Fluoroethyl)-L-Tryptophan using a One-pot, Two-step Protocol

AUTHORS: Xuyi Yue, Rahul M Nikam, Heidi H Kecskemethy, Vinay V R Kandula, Stephen J Falchek, Lauren W Averill, Sigrid A Langhans

JOURNAL: Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
The kynurenine pathway (KP) is a primary route for tryptophan metabolism. Evidence strongly suggests that metabolites of the KP play a vital role in tumor proliferation, epilepsy, neurodegenerative diseases, and psychiatric illnesses due to their immune-modulatory, neuro-modulatory, and neurotoxic effects. The most extensively used positron emission tomography (PET) agent for mapping tryptophan metabolism, α-[11C]methyl-L-tryptophan ([11C]AMT), has a short half-life of 20 min with laborious radiosynthesis procedures. An onsite cyclotron is required to radiosynthesize [11C]AMT. Only a limited number of centers produce [11C]AMT for preclinical studies and clinical investigations. Hence, the development of an alternative imaging agent that has a longer half-life, favorable in vivo kinetics, and is easy to automate is urgently needed. The utility and value of 1-(2-[18F]fluoroethyl)-L-tryptophan, a fluorine-18-labeled tryptophan analog, has been reported in preclinical applications in cell line-derived xenografts, patient-derived xenografts, and transgenic tumor models. This paper presents a protocol for the radiosynthesis of 1-(2-[18F]fluoroethyl)-L-tryptophan using a one-pot, two-step strategy. Using this protocol, the radiotracer can be produced in a 20 ± 5% (decay corrected at the end of synthesis, n > 20) radiochemical yield, with both radiochemical purity and enantiomeric excess of over 95%. The protocol features a small precursor amount with no more than 0.5 mL of reaction solvent in each step, low loading of potentially toxic 4,7,13,16,21,24-hexaoxa-1,10-diazabicyclo[8.8.8]hexacosane (K222), and an environmentally benign and injectable mobile phase for purification. The protocol can be easily configured to produce 1-(2-[18F]fluoroethyl)-L-tryptophan for clinical investigation in a commercially available module.

TITLE: Synthesis and evaluation of bifunctional DFO2K: a modular chelator with ideal properties for zirconium-89 chelation

AUTHORS: Akam K Salih, Elaheh Khozeimeh Sarbisheh, Shvan J Raheem, Moralba Dominguez-Garcia, Hillary H Mehlhorn, Eric W Price

JOURNAL: Dalton transactions (Cambridge, England : 2003)

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
The synthesis and evaluation of the newest generation of our DFO2 chelator family-DFO2K-is described. DFO2K was designed with a simple synthetic route to access different bifunctional derivatives, with each derivative having similar metal ion coordination spheres and high denticity (up to 12 coordinate) to ensure stable coordination of zirconium-89. The high denticity could potentially enhance stability with other large oxophilic radiometals. Zirconium-89 is the most popular radionuclide to pair with large macromolecules such as antibodies (immunoPET) for positron emission tomography applications. Although clinically successful, the stability of the "gold standard" chelator desferrioxamine B (DFO) can be improved as significant bone uptake is observed in animal models, despite no obvious stability issues in humans. Following the synthesis of DFO2K we assessed its radiolabeling efficiency with zirconium-89 and compared with DFO, which revealed rapid and nearly identical radiolabeling kinetics to DFO. The resultant [89Zr]Zr-DFO2K complex showed improved stability over [89Zr]Zr-DFO in differentin vitrostability assays such as hydroxyapatite and 1000-fold molar excess EDTA challenges. Furthermore, biodistribution studies of the non-bifunctional chelators in healthy mice showed that [89Zr]Zr-DFO2K had a similar distribution profile and clearance to [89Zr]Zr-DFO. The bifunctional derivativep-SCN-Ph-DFO2K was conjugated to a non-specific human IgG antibody and evaluated after 2 weeks circulating in healthy female CD1 mice. Mice administered [89Zr]Zr-DFO2K-IgG showed substantially lower bone uptake in PET-CT images than [89Zr]Zr-DFO-IgG, with PET ROI data andex vivobiodistribution revealing a statistically significantly lower bone uptake for DFO2K. Overall, owing to its high denticity, ease of synthesis, improved solubility over DFO2 and DFO2p, and stable chelation of zirconium-89, DFO2K appears to be an improved alternative chelator to DFO for zirconium-89 chelation.

TITLE: Measurement of cyclosporin induced changes in P-glycoprotein function at the human blood-brain barrier using [18F]MC225 and PET

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Introduction: P-glycoprotein (P-gp) or multidrug-resistance protein is one of the most extensively studied efflux transporters at the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Changes in P-gp function are associated with several neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia and with the bioavailability of several pharmaceuticals in the brain, causing multi-drug resistance or side effects. PET imaging can be used to measure the P-gp function in vivo. This study aims to validate [18F]MC225 as specific P-gp PET tracer with the use of cyclosporin as selective P-gp inhibitor.

Methods: Fourteen healthy volunteers (age 67 ± 5y) were included. Subjects underwent twice a 60 min dynamic [18F]MC225 (200MBq) PET scan with continuous arterial blood sampling and a cerebral T1-weighted MRI as anatomical reference. During the second scan, in five subjects, cyclosporin was administered in a dose of 2.5 mg/kg/hour, starting 30 min prior to the scan, to inhibit the BBB P-gp function. Tissue time-activity curves of preselected brain regions (Hammer's atlas) were fitted to a reversible two-tissue compartment model (2T4k) using the metabolite corrected plasma and uncorrected whole blood curves as input functions.

Results: No significant difference was found in plasma kinetics, plasma curves, plasma-to-whole blood ratio, and the parent fraction of the baseline scans and scans after administration of cyclosporin. Volume of distribution values in whole brain grey matter showed a significant increase (6.18 ± 1.29 to 9.00 ± 1.29 mL·cm- 3,p = 0.03) after the administration of cyclosporin.

Conclusion: The outcomes of the current study reflect the potential ability of [18F]MC225 to measure cyclosporin induced changes in P-gp function at the human BBB in vivo.

ABSTRACT:
6-O-[18F]Fluoroethylerlotinib (6-O-[18F]FEE), with a suitable half-life for commercial distribution, may be a good replacement for [11C]erlotinib to identify epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) positive tumors with activating mutations to tyrosine kinase inhibitors therapy. In this study, we explored the fully automated synthesis of 6-O-[18F]FEE and investigated its pharmacokinetics in tumor-bearing mice. 6-O-[18F]FEE with high specific activity (28-100 GBq/μmol) and radiochemistry purity (over 99 %) was obtained by two-step reaction and Radio-HPLC separation in PET-MF-2 V-IT-1 automated synthesizer. PET imaging of 6-O-[18F]FEE in HCC827, A431, and U87 tumor-bearing mice with different EGFR expression and mutation was performed. Uptake and blocking of PET imaging indicated that the probe specifically targeted exon 19 deleted EGFR (the quantitative analysis of tumor-to-mouse ratio for HCC827, HCC827 blocking, U87, A431 was 2.58 ± 0.24, 1.20 ± 0.15, 1.18 ± 0.19, and 1.05 ± 0.13 respectively). Dynamic imaging was used to study the pharmacokinetics of the probe in tumor-bearing mice. Logan plot graphical analysis demonstrated late linearity and a high fitting correlation coefficient (0.998), supporting reversible kinetics. According to the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) rule, the 2-compartment reversible model was more consistent with the metabolic properties of 6-O-[18F]FEE. The automated radiosynthesis and pharmacokinetic analysis will promote clinically transformation of 6-O-[18F]FEE.

JOURNAL: Biomolecules

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: The skeletal muscle has been proposed to contribute to the progressive loss of motor neurons typical of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). However, this mechanism has not yet been clarified due to the lack of suitable imaging tools. Here, we aimed to verify whether PET imaging of the translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO) can detect a muscular abnormality in an experimental model of ALS.

Methods: In vivo biodistribution and kinetics of [18F]DPA-714 were analyzed in skeletal muscle and brain of SOD1G93Atransgenic mice and in wildtype (WT) littermates. Both cohorts were divided into three groups (n = 6 each) to be studied at 60, 90 and 120 days. After microPET imaging, animals were sacrificed to evaluate inflammatory infiltrates by hematoxylin/eosin staining and TSPO expression by immunohistochemistry and Western blot in both quadriceps and brain.

Results: [18F]DPA-714 uptake was higher in the skeletal muscles of SOD1G93Athan in WT mice in the preclinical phase (60 and 90 days) and further increased up to the symptomatic late stage (120 days). Inflammatory cells were absent in the quadriceps of SOD1G93Amice whose myocytes, instead, showed a progressive increase in TSPO expression with advancing age. By contrast, brain tracer uptake and TSPO expression were comparably low in both groups, regardless of age and genotype.

Conclusion: Upregulation of TSPO expression is characteristic of skeletal muscle, but not the brain, in the experimental SOD1G93Amouse model of ALS. Tracers targeting this pathway have been mostly proposed for the evaluation of inflammatory processes within the central nervous system. Nevertheless, the ubiquitous nature of TSPO expression and its responsiveness to various signals may broaden the diagnostic potential of these tracers to include disease conditions beyond inflammation.

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: P-glycoprotein (P-gp) function is altered in several brain disorders; thus, it is of interest to monitor the P-gp function in vivo using PET. (R)-[11C]verapamil is considered the gold standard tracer to measure the P-gp function; however, it presents some drawbacks that limit its use. New P-gp tracers have been developed with improved properties, such as [18F]MC225. This study compares the characteristics of (R)-[11C]verapamil and [18F]MC225 in the same subjects.

Methods: Three non-human primates underwent 4 PET scans: 2 with (R)-[11C]verapamil and 2 with [18F]MC225, at baseline and after P-gp inhibition. The 30-min PET data were analyzed using 1-Tissue Compartment Model (1-TCM) and metabolite-corrected plasma as input function. Tracer kinetic parameters at baseline and after inhibition were compared. Regional differences and simplified methods to quantify the P-gp function were also assessed.

Results: At baseline, [18F]MC225 VTvalues were higher, and k2values were lower than those of (R)-[11C]verapamil, whereas K1values were not significantly different. After inhibition, VTvalues of the 2 tracers were similar; however, (R)-[11C]verapamil K1and k2values were higher than those of [18F]MC225. Significant regional differences between tracers were found at baseline, which disappeared after inhibition. The positive slope of the SUV-TAC was positively correlated to the K1and VTof both tracers.

Conclusion: [18F]MC225 and (R)-[11C]verapamil show comparable sensitivity to measure the P-gp function in non-human primates. Moreover, this study highlights the 30-min VTas the best parameter to measure decreases in the P-gp function with both tracers. [18F]MC225 may become the first radiofluorinated tracer able to measure decreases and increases in the P-gp function due to its higher baseline VT.

TITLE: Optimisation of Animal Handing and Timing of 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose PET Tumour Imaging in Mice

AUTHORS: Richard L Hesketh, David Y Lewis, Kevin M Brindle

JOURNAL: Molecular imaging and biology

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: In humans, 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose ([18F]FDG) tumour-to-background contrast continues to increase long after a typical uptake period of 45 - 60 min. Similar studies have not been performed in mice and the static imaging time point for most studies is arbitrarily set at 30 - 60 min post-injection of [18F]FDG. Ideally, static PET imaging should be performed after the initial period of rapid uptake but this period has not been defined in mice, with previous dynamic studies in mice being limited to 60 min. This study aimed to define the kinetics of [18F]FDG biodistribution over periods of 3 - 4 h in different murine tumour models, both subcutaneous and autochthonous, and to further refine fasting and warming protocols used prior to imaging.

Procedures: Dynamic [18F]FDG PET-CT scans lasting 3 or 4 h were performed with C57BL/6 J and Balb/c nude mice bearing subcutaneous EL4 murine T-cell lymphoma and Colo205 human colorectal tumours, respectively, and with transgenic Eμ-Myc lymphoma mice. Prior to [18F]FDG injection, four combinations of different animal handling conditions were used: warming for 1 h at 31 °C; maintenance at room temperature (20 - 24 °C), fasting for 6 - 10 h and a fed state.

Results: Tumour mean standardised uptake value (SUVmean) peaked at 147 ± 48 min post injection in subcutaneous tumours and 74 ± 31 min in autochthonous Eμ-Myc lymphomas. The tumour-to-blood ratio (TBR) peaked at 171 ± 57 and 83 ± 33 min in subcutaneous and autochthonous Eμ-Myc tumours, respectively. Fasting increased tumour [18F]FDG uptake and suppressed myocardial uptake in EL4 tumour-bearing mice. There was a good correlation between tumour SUVmeanand Kicalculated using an input function (IDIF) derived from the inferior vena cava.

Conclusions: Delayed static [18F]FDG-PET imaging (> 60 min) in both autochthonous and subcutaneous tumours in improved tumour-to-background contrast and increased reproducibility.

TITLE: Development of a 99mTc-labeled tetrazine for pretargeted SPECT imaging using an alendronic acid-based bone targeting model

AUTHORS: Lennart Bohrmann, Christian B M Poulie, Cristina Rodríguez-Rodríguez, Stoyan Karagiozov, Katayoun Saatchi, Matthias M Herth, Urs O Häfeli

JOURNAL: PloS one

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Pretargeting, which is the separation of target accumulation and the administration of a secondary imaging agent into two sequential steps, offers the potential to improve image contrast and reduce radiation burden for nuclear imaging. In recent years, the tetrazine ligation has emerged as a promising approach to facilitate covalent pretargeted imaging due to its unprecedented kinetics and bioorthogonality. Pretargeted bone imaging with TCO-modified alendronic acid (Aln-TCO) is an attractive model that allows the evaluation of tetrazines in healthy animals without the need for complex disease models or targeting regimens. Recent structure-activity relationship studies of tetrazines evaluated important parameters for the design of potent tetrazine-radiotracers for pretargeted imaging. However, limited information is available for 99mTc-labeled tetrazines. In this study, four tetrazines intended for labeling with fac-[99mTc(OH2)3 (CO)3]+ were synthesized and evaluated using an Aln-TCO mouse model. 3,6-bis(2-pyridyl)-1,2,4,5-Tz without additional linker showed higher pretargeted bone uptake and less background activity compared to the same scaffold with a PEG8 linker or 3-phenyl-1,2,4,5-Tz-based compounds. Additionally, improved bone/blood ratios were observed in pretargeted animals compared to animals receiving directly labeled Aln-TCO. The results of this study implicate 3,6-bis(2-pyridyl)-1,2,4,5-Tz as a promising scaffold for potential 99mTc-labeled tetrazines.

TITLE: Structural and functional study on cysteine 495, coordinating ligand to T1Cu site in multicopper oxidase CopA

AUTHORS: Wenwei Tang, Haoxiang Liu, Xinping Zeng

JOURNAL: Chemosphere

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Excessive intake of manganese seriously affects human health. Manganese oxidizing bacteria can efficiently remove manganese, among which manganese oxidase plays a decisive role. Multicopper oxidase, one of the manganese oxidases, has 4 copper binding sites, among them, T1Cu coordinates with two histidine, one cysteine and one axial residue, mainly transferring electrons from the substrate to T2Cu and T3Cu. Here, we conducted site-directed mutagenesis on T1Cu coordinating 495 amino acid site from cysteine to aspartic acid, histidine and methionine in multicopper oxidase CopA from Brevibacillus panacihumi MK-8, through the enzyme kinetics and structure models, finding that the enzyme catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) of the mutated C495H with Mn2+and ABTS reached 9.03 min-1mM-1and 8863 s-1mM-1, 1.47 times and 1.67 times that of CopA. And it was found strain Rosetta-pET-copAC495Hcould remove 91.67% manganese after 7-day culture, which was 11.65% higher than the original strain. To sum up, these results provide a vision for the future application of protein engineering in biological manganese removal.

TITLE: Influence of drying conditions, food composition, and water activity on the thermal resistance of Salmonella enterica

AUTHORS: Harleen Kaur Dhaliwal, Michael Gänzle, M S Roopesh

JOURNAL: Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Salmonella contamination of low-water activity (aw) foods poses a serious concern worldwide. The present study was conducted to assess the effects of drying conditions, food composition, and water activity on the desiccation tolerance and thermal resistance of S. Enteritidis FUA1946, S. Senftenberg ATCC43845 and S. Typhimurium ATCC13311 in pet food, binder formulation, and skim milk powder. The samples were wet inoculated with the individual Salmonella strains and were equilibrated to aw0.33 and 0.75, followed by an isothermal treatment at 70 °C. The thermal inactivation data was fitted to the Weibull model. Irrespective of the aw, food composition and physical structure of the selected foods, strain S. Enteritidis FUA1946 displayed the highest desiccation and thermal resistance, followed by S. Senftenberg ATCC43845 and S. Typhimurium ATCC13311. The food matrix and strain type significantly (p < 0.05) influenced the thermal resistance of microorganisms in foods along with awchange during thermal treatments. To further study the effect of food composition, an additional set of experiments using dry inoculation of the resistant Salmonella strain in the low-awfoods was designed. Significant (p < 0.05) matrix-dependent interaction on Salmonella reduction was observed. The water adsorption isotherms of selected low-awfoods were measured at 20 and 70 °C to relate the thermal inactivation kinetics with the change in the aw. The characterization of thermal resistance of the Salmonella serovars in low-awproducts with different compositions and awin this study may be used for the validation of thermal challenge studies.

TITLE: Impairments in synaptic inhibition and glucose hypometabolism contribute to epileptogenesis in Wistar Audiogenic Rats with cortical malformation

JOURNAL: Neuroscience

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Epilepsy associated with malformations of cortical development (MCD) is often characterized by impaired cortical inhibition and altered brain metabolism, both of which play a key role in epileptogenesis. Recently, we reported the Wistar Audiogenic Rat (WAR), an epileptic-prone strain with induced cortical microgyria, exhibited increased ictogenesis and enhanced local cortical network synchrony, making it a reliable model to study epileptogenesis during development. The present study aimed to evaluate synaptic inhibition and glucose metabolism in several brain regions of this two-hit model of epilepsy (WAR-MCD) during the development. Unilateral cortical microgyria was induced via freeze-lesion in male and female neonatal WARs. Spontaneous and miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs and mIPSCs) were recorded in cortical pyramidal neurons adjacent to, distant from the microgyria, and the contralateral hemisphere during the juvenile and adolescent periods. Additionally, in vivo brain glucose metabolism was assessed during the same periods using [18F]FDG Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging. We observed significant reductions in amplitude, frequency and altered kinetics of sIPSCs in pyramidal neurons of MCD rats during the juvenile period. Synaptic inhibition deficits in paramicrogyral and contralateral cortices were even more pronounced in the two-hit model during adolescence. Glucose hypometabolism was evident in several brain regions of WARs and was further intensified in the two-hit model. These findings suggest an age-dependent disruption of cortical inhibition and glucose metabolism associated with MCD, further exacerbated by pro-epileptic conditions, contributing to epileptogenesis.

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Myocardial infarction (MI) is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, and inflammation is central to tissue response and patient outcomes. The 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO) has been used in PET as an inflammatory biomarker. The aims of this study were to screen novel, fluorinated, TSPO radiotracers for susceptibility to the rs6971 genetic polymorphism using in vitro competition binding assays in human brain and heart; assess whether the in vivo characteristics of our lead radiotracer,18F-LW223, are suitable for clinical translation; and validate whether18F-LW223 can detect macrophage-driven inflammation in a rat MI model.Methods:Fifty-one human brain and 29 human heart tissue samples were screened for the rs6971 polymorphism. Competition binding assays were conducted with3H-PK11195 and the following ligands: PK11195, PBR28, and our novel compounds (AB5186 and LW223). Naïve rats and mice were used for in vivo PET kinetic studies, radiometabolite studies, and dosimetry experiments. Rats underwent permanent coronary artery ligation and were scanned using PET/CT with an invasive input function at 7 d after MI. For quantification of PET signal in the hypoperfused myocardium,K1(rate constant for transfer from arterial plasma to tissues) was used as a surrogate marker of perfusion to correct the binding potential for impaired radiotracer transfer from plasma to tissue (BPTC).Results:LW223 binding to TSPO was not susceptible to the rs6971 genetic polymorphism in human brain and heart samples. In rodents,18F-LW223 displayed a specific uptake consistent with TSPO expression, a slow metabolism in blood (69% of parent at 120 min), a high plasma free fraction of 38.5%, and a suitable dosimetry profile (effective dose of 20.5-24.5 μSv/MBq).18F-LW223 BPTCwas significantly higher in the MI cohort within the infarct territory of the anterior wall relative to the anterior wall of naïve animals (32.7 ± 5.0 vs. 10.0 ± 2.4 cm3/mL/min,P≤ 0.001). Ex vivo immunofluorescent staining for TSPO and CD68 (macrophage marker) resulted in the same pattern seen with in vivo BPTCanalysis.Conclusion:18F-LW223 is not susceptible to the rs6971 genetic polymorphism in in vitro assays, has favorable in vivo characteristics, and is able to accurately map macrophage-driven inflammation after MI.

JOURNAL: Molecular imaging and biology

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: The presence and functional competence of intratumoral CD8+T cells is often a barometer for successful immunotherapeutic responses in cancer. Despite this understanding and the extensive number of clinical-stage immunotherapies focused on potentiation (co-stimulation) or rescue (checkpoint blockade) of CD8+T cell antitumor activity, dynamic biomarker strategies are often lacking. To help fill this gap, immuno-PET nuclear imaging has emerged as a powerful tool for in vivo molecular imaging of antibody targeting. Here, we took advantage of immuno-PET imaging using89Zr-IAB42M1-14, anti-mouse CD8 minibody, to characterize CD8+T-cell tumor infiltration dynamics following ICOS (inducible T-cell co-stimulator) agonist antibody treatment alone and in combination with PD-1 blocking antibody in a model of mammary carcinoma.

Procedures: Female BALB/c mice with established EMT6 tumors received 10 µg, IP of either IgG control antibodies, ICOS agonist monotherapy, or ICOS/PD-1 combination therapy on days 0, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10, or 14. Imaging was performed at 24 and 48 h post IV dose of89Zr IAB42M1-14. In addition to89Zr-IAB42M1-14 uptake in tumor and tumor-draining lymph node (TDLN), 3D radiomic features were extracted from PET/CT images to identify treatment effects. Imaging mass cytometry (IMC) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed at end of study.

Results: 89Zr-IAB42M1-14 uptake in the tumor was observed by day 11 and was preceded by an increase in the TDLN as early as day 4. The spatial distribution of89Zr-IAB42M1-14 was more uniform in the drug treated vs. control tumors, which had spatially distinct tracer uptake in the periphery relative to the core of the tumor. IMC analysis showed an increased percentage of cytotoxic T cells in the ICOS monotherapy and ICOS/PD-1 combination group compared to IgG controls. Additionally, temporal radiomics analysis demonstrated early predictiveness of imaging features.

Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first detailed description of the use of a novel immune-PET imaging technique to assess the kinetics of CD8+T-cell infiltration into tumor and lymphoid tissues following ICOS agonist and PD-1 blocking antibody therapy. By demonstrating the capacity for increased spatial and temporal resolution of CD8+T-cell infiltration across tumors and lymphoid tissues, these observations underscore the widespread potential clinical utility of non-invasive PET imaging for T-cell-based immunotherapy in cancer.

AUTHORS: Richard Ågren, Hugo Zeberg, Tomasz Maciej Stępniewski, R Benjamin Free, Sean W Reilly, Robert R Luedtke, Peter Århem, Francisco Ciruela, David R Sibley, Robert H Mach, Jana Selent, Johanna Nilsson, Kristoffer Sahlholm

JOURNAL: ACS chemical neuroscience

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
A solid understanding of the mechanisms governing ligand binding is crucial for rational design of therapeutics targeting the dopamine D2receptor (D2R). Here, we use G protein-coupled inward rectifier potassium (GIRK) channel activation inXenopusoocytes to measure the kinetics of D2R antagonism by a series of aripiprazole analogues, as well as the recovery of dopamine (DA) responsivity upon washout. The aripiprazole analogues comprise an orthosteric and a secondary pharmacophore and differ by the length of the saturated carbon linker joining these two pharmacophores. Two compounds containing 3- and 5-carbon linkers allowed for a similar extent of recovery from antagonism in the presence of 1 or 100 μM DA (>25 and >90% of control, respectively), whereas recovery was less prominent (∼20%) upon washout of the 4-carbon linker compound, SV-III-130, both with 1 and 100 μM DA. Prolonging the coincubation time with SV-III-130 further diminished recovery. Curve-shift experiments were consistent with competition between SV-III-130 and DA. Two mutations in the secondary binding pocket (V91A and E95A) of D2R decreased antagonistic potency and increased recovery from SV-III-130 antagonism, whereas a third mutation (L94A) only increased recovery. Our results suggest that the secondary binding pocket influences recovery from inhibition by the studied aripiprazole analogues. We propose a mechanism, supported byin silicomodeling, whereby SV-III-130 initially binds reversibly to the D2R, after which the drug-receptor complex undergoes a slow transition to a second ligand-bound state, which is dependent on secondary binding pocket integrity and irreversible during the time frame of our experiments.

AUTHORS: Philip A Corrado, Gregory P Barton, Francheska C Razalan-Krause, Christopher J François, Naomi C Chesler, Oliver Wieben, Marlowe Eldridge, Alan B McMillan, Kara N Goss

JOURNAL: Journal of clinical medicine

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Individuals born very premature have an increased cardiometabolic and heart failure risk. While the structural differences of the preterm heart are now well-described, metabolic insights into the physiologic mechanisms underpinning this risk are needed. Here, we used dynamic fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (PET-MRI) in young adults born term and preterm during normoxic (N = 28 preterm; 18 term) and hypoxic exposure (12% O2; N = 26 preterm; 17 term) to measure the myocardial metabolic rate of glucose (MMRglc) in young adults born term (N = 18) and preterm (N = 32), hypothesizing that young adults born preterm would have higher rates of MMRglc under normoxic conditions and a reduced ability to augment glucose metabolism under hypoxic conditions. MMRglc was calculated from the myocardial and blood pool time-activity curves by fitting the measured activities to the 3-compartment model of FDG kinetics. MMRglc was similar at rest between term and preterm subjects, and decreased during hypoxia exposure in both groups (p= 0.02 for MMRglc hypoxia effect). There were no differences observed between groups in the metabolic response to hypoxia, either globally (serum glucose and lactate measures) or within the myocardium. Thus, we did not find evidence of altered myocardial metabolism in the otherwise healthy preterm-born adult. However, whether subtle changes in myocardial metabolism may preceed or predict heart failure in this population remains to be determined.

TITLE: Nicotine Patch Alters Patterns of Cigarette Smoking-Induced Dopamine Release: Patterns Relate to Biomarkers Associated With Treatment Response

AUTHORS: Yasmin Zakiniaeiz, Heather Liu, Hong Gao, Soheila Najafzadeh, Jim Ropchan, Nabeel Nabulsi, Yiyun Huang, David Matuskey, Ming-Kai Chen, Kelly P Cosgrove, Evan D Morris

JOURNAL: Nicotine & tobacco research : official journal of the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Introduction: Tobacco smoking is a major public health burden. The first-line pharmacological treatment for tobacco smoking is nicotine replacement therapy (eg, the nicotine patch (NIC)). Nicotine acts on nicotinic-acetylcholine receptors on dopamine terminals to release dopamine in the ventral and dorsal striatum encoding reward and habit formation, respectively.

Aims and methods: To better understand treatment efficacy, a naturalistic experimental design combined with a kinetic model designed to characterize smoking-induced dopamine release in vivo was used. Thirty-five tobacco smokers (16 female) wore a NIC (21 mg, daily) for 1-week and a placebo patch (PBO) for 1-week in a randomized, counter-balanced order. Following 1-week under NIC and then overnight abstinence, smokers participated in a 90-minute [11C]raclopride positron emission tomography scan and smoked a cigarette while in the scanner. Identical procedures were followed for the PBO scan. A time-varying kinetic model was used at the voxel level to model transient dopamine release peaking instantaneously at the start of the stimulus and decaying exponentially. Magnitude and spatial extent of dopamine release were estimated. Smokers were subcategorized by nicotine dependence level and nicotine metabolism rate.

Results: Dopamine release magnitude was enhanced by NIC in ventral striatum and diminished by NIC in dorsal striatum. More-dependent smokers activated more voxels than the less-dependent smokers under both conditions. Under PBO, fast metabolizers activated more voxels in ventral striatum and fewer voxels in dorsal striatum compared to slow metabolizers.

Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that the model captured a pattern of transient dopamine responses to cigarette smoking which may be different across smoker subgroup categorizations.

Implications: This is the first study to show that NIC alters highly localized patterns of cigarette smoking-induced dopamine release and that levels of nicotine dependence and nicotine clearance rate contribute to these alterations. This current work included a homogeneous subject sample with regards to demographic and smoking variables, as well as a highly sensitive model capable of detecting significant acute dopamine transients. The findings of this study add support to the recent identification of biomarkers for predicting the effect of nicotine replacement therapies on dopamine function which could help refine clinical practice for smoking cessation.

TITLE: Preclinical evaluation of Affibody molecule for PET imaging of human pancreatic islets derived from stem cells

AUTHORS: Pierre Cheung, Julia Thorngren, Bo Zhang, Svitlana Vasylovska, Francesco Lechi, Jonas Persson, Stefan Ståhl, John Löfblom, Olle Korsgren, Jonas Eriksson, Joey Lau, Olof Eriksson

JOURNAL: EJNMMI research

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Background: Beta-cell replacement methods such as transplantation of isolated donor islets have been proposed as a curative treatment of type 1 diabetes, but widespread application is challenging due to shortages of donor tissue and the need for continuous immunosuppressive treatments. Stem-cell-derived islets have been suggested as an alternative source of beta cells, but face transplantation protocols optimization difficulties, mainly due to a lack of available methods and markers to directly monitor grafts survival, as well as their localization and function. Molecular imaging techniques and particularly positron emission tomography has been suggested as a tool for monitoring the fate of islets after clinical transplantation. The integral membrane protein DGCR2 has been demonstrated to be a potential pancreatic islet biomarker, with specific expression on insulin-positive human embryonic stem-cell-derived pancreatic progenitor cells. The candidate Affibody molecule ZDGCR2:AM106was radiolabeled with fluorine-18 using a novel click chemistry-based approach. The resulting positron emission tomography tracer [18F]ZDGCR2:AM106was evaluated for binding to recombinant human DGCR2 and cryosections of stem-cell-derived islets, as well as in vivo using an immune-deficient mouse model transplanted with stem-cell-derived islets. Biodistribution of the [18F]ZDGCR2:AM106was also assessed in healthy rats and pigs.

Results: [18F]ZDGCR2:AM106was successfully synthesized with high radiochemical purity and yield via a pretargeting approach. [18F]ZDGCR2:AM106retained binding to recombinant human DCGR2 as well as to cryosectioned stem-cell-derived islets, but in vivo binding to native pancreatic tissue in both rat and pig was low. However, in vivo uptake of [18F]ZDGCR2:AM106in stem-cell-derived islets transplanted in the immunodeficient mice was observed, albeit only within the early imaging frames after injection of the radiotracer.

Conclusion: Targeting of DGCR2 is a promising approach for in vivo detection of stem-cell-derived islets grafts by molecular imaging. The synthesis of [18F]ZDGCR2:AM106was successfully performed via a pretargeting method to label a site-specific covalently bonded fluorine-18 to the Affibody molecule. However, the rapid washout of [18F]ZDGCR2:AM106from the stem-cell-derived islets graft indicates that dissociation kinetics can be improved. Further studies using alternative binders of similar classes with improved binding potential are warranted.

JOURNAL: Bioorganic chemistry

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
This study aimed to develop and evaluate two novel18F-labeled radiopharmaceuticals, [18F]AlF-NOTA-De-FAPI and [18F]AlF-NOTA-Glu-FAPI, for Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging of tumors expressing fibroblast activation protein. Molecular docking simulations predicted the binding affinities of NOTA-De-FAPI and NOTA-Glu-FAPI with FAP. The radiotracers were synthesized and evaluated for radiochemical yield, purity, and molar activity. Surface plasmon resonance analysis measured binding kinetics. In vitro and in vivo stability and distribution coefficients were assessed. PET/CT imaging and ex vivo biodistribution studies were conducted in U87MG tumor-bearing mice. A pilot clinical study compared [18F]AlF-NOTA-De-FAPI with [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-FAPI-04 and [18F]FDG in a liver cancer patient. Molecular docking simulations showed that NOTA-De-FAPI had a slightly higher binding affinity for FAP. The radiotracers were synthesized with high purity and molar activity. SPR analysis confirmed higher binding affinity of NOTA-De-FAPI (KD= 86.35 pM) compared to NOTA-Glu-FAPI (KD= 187 pM). In PET/CT imaging, [18F]AlF-NOTA-De-FAPI demonstrated higher tumor uptake in U87MG tumor-bearing mice, with a peak SUVmaxof 2.71 ± 0.39 at 1 h post-injection. Ex vivo biodistribution studies showed that [18F]AlF-NOTA-De-FAPI had a tumor uptake of 9.16 ± 0.49 %ID/g at 1 h post-injection, significantly higher than [18F]AlF-NOTA-Glu-FAPI (6.60 ± 0.82 %ID/g). In the clinical study, [18F]AlF-NOTA-De-FAPI showed strong uptake in the primary tumor but exhibited higher physiological uptake in salivary glands, thyroid, and pancreas compared to [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-FAPI-04. [18F]AlF-NOTA-De-FAPI demonstrated potential as a FAP-targeting tracer with high specific uptake and favorable tumor-to-normal tissue ratios in preclinical models. However, clinical evaluation revealed limitations, such as high physiological uptake in certain glands and lower tumor uptake compared to [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-FAPI-04. Further optimization and clinical validation are needed.

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Fibroblast activation protein (FAP), which has high expression in cancer-associated fibroblasts of epithelial cancers, can be used as a theranostic target. Our previous study used64Cu and225Ac-labelled FAP inhibitors (FAPI-04) for a FAP-expressing pancreatic cancer xenograft imaging and therapy. However, the optimal therapeutic radionuclide for FAPI needs to be investigated further. In this study, we evaluated the therapeutic effects of beta-emitter (177Lu)-labelled FAPI-46 and alpha-emitter (225Ac)-labelled FAPI-46 in pancreatic cancer models.

Methods: PET scans (1 h post injection) were acquired in PANC-1 xenograft mice (n = 9) after the administration of [18F]FAPI-74 (12.4 ± 1.7 MBq) for the companion imaging. The biodistribution of [177Lu]FAPI-46 and [225Ac]FAPI-46 were evaluated in the xenograft model (total n = 12). For the determination of treatment effects, [177Lu]FAPI-46 and [225Ac]FAPI-46 were injected into PANC-1 xenograft mice at different doses: 3 MBq (n = 6), 10 MBq (n = 6), 30 MBq (n = 6), control (n = 4) for [177Lu]FAPI-46, and 3 kBq (n = 3), 10 kBq (n = 2), 30 kBq (n = 6), control (n = 7) for [225Ac]FAPI-46. Tumour sizes and body weights were followed.

Results: [18F]FAPI-74 showed rapid clearance by the kidneys and high accumulation in the tumour and intestine 1 h after administration. [177Lu]FAPI-46 and [225Ac]FAPI-46 also showed rapid clearance by the kidneys and relatively high accumulation in the tumour at 3 h. Both [177Lu]FAPI-46 and [225Ac]FAPI-46 showed tumour-suppressive effects, with a mild decrease in body weight. The treatment effects of [177Lu]FAPI-46 were relatively slow but lasted longer than those of [225Ac]FAPI-46.

Conclusion: This study suggested the possible application of FAPI radioligand therapy in FAP-expressing pancreatic cancer. Further evaluation is necessary to find the best radionuclide with shorter half-life, as well as the combination with therapies targeting tumour cells directly.

TITLE: The Clinical Profile of Tremor in Parkinson's Disease

AUTHORS: Jacopo Pasquini, Günther Deuschl, Alessandro Pecori, Stefano Salvadori, Roberto Ceravolo, Nicola Pavese

JOURNAL: Movement disorders clinical practice

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Background: Tremor is one of the most troublesome manifestations of Parkinson's Disease (PD) and its response to dopaminergic medication is variable; an evidence-based framework of PD tremor is lacking yet needed to inform future investigations.

Objective: To perform a comprehensive longitudinal analysis on the clinical characteristics, course and response to dopaminergic medication of tremor in de-novo PD.

Methods: Three hundred ninety-seven participants were recruited in the Parkinson Progressive Markers Initiative, a prospective observational cohort study in early de-novo PD. Rest, postural and kinetic tremor scores were extracted from the Movement Disorders Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale. Progression from baseline to 7-year follow-up of rest, postural and kinetic tremor scores, and their response to in-clinic dopaminergic medication were analyzed through linear mixed-effects models adjusted for age, sex and disease duration at enrollment. A sensitivity analysis was conducted through subgroup and imputation analyses.

Results: 382 (96.2%) participants showed tremor and 346 (87.2%) showed rest tremor in at least one assessment over 7 years.Off-state rest, postural and kinetic tremor scores increased significantly over time, coupled with a significant effect of dopaminergic medication in reducing tremor scores. However, at each assessment, tremor was unresponsive to in-clinic dopaminergic medication in at least 20% of participants for rest, 30% for postural and 38% for kinetic tremor.

Conclusions: PD tremor is a troublesome manifestation, with increasing severity and variable response to medications. This analysis details the current clinical natural history of tremor in early-to-mid stage PD, outlining an evidence-based framework for future pathophysiological and interventional studies.

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Current screening and monitoring of prostate cancer (PCa) is insufficient, producing inaccurate diagnoses. Presence of the receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) is associated with signature characteristics of PCa development such as cell proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, angiogenesis, migration, invasion, and poor patient survival. Therefore, we developed a preclinical multimodal imaging strategy targeted at RAGE to diagnose and monitor PCa.

Methods: In this work, RAGE-targeted multimodal nanoparticles (64Cu-Cy5-G4-CML) were synthesized and rendered functional for nuclear and optical imaging using previously established methods. The probe's binding affinity and targeting specificity was assessed in androgen-dependent (LNCaP) and androgen-independent (DU145) prostate cancer cells using flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. In vivo PET-CT imaging was used to evaluate RAGE levels in DU145 and LNCaP xenograft models in mice. Then, tumors were excised post-imaging for histological staining and autoradiography to further assess RAGE levels and targeting efficiency of the tracer. Finally, RAGE levels from human PCa samples of varying Gleason Scores were evaluated using Western blot and immunohistochemical staining.

Results: PCa cell culture studies confirmed adequate RAGE-targeting with 64Cu-Cy5-G4-CML with KDbetween 360 and 540 nM as measured by flow cytometry. In vivo PET-CT images of PCa xenografts revealed favorable kinetics, rapid blood clearance, and a non-homogenous, enhanced uptake in tumors, which varied based on cell type and tumor size with mean uptake between 0.5 and 1.4%ID/g. RAGE quantification of human samples confirmed increased RAGE uptake corresponding to increased Gleason scoring.

Conclusions: Our study has shown that RAGE-targeted cancer imaging is feasible and could significantly impact PCa management.

ABSTRACT:
Neuroimaging of blood-brain barrier permeability has been instrumental in identifying its broad involvement in neurological and systemic diseases. However, current methods evaluate the blood-brain barrier mainly as a structural barrier. Here we developed a non-invasive positron emission tomography method in humans to measure the blood-brain barrier permeability of molecular radiotracers that cross the blood-brain barrier through its molecule-specific transport mechanism. Our method uses high-temporal resolution dynamic imaging and kinetic modeling for multiparametric imaging and quantification of the blood-brain barrier permeability-surface area product of molecular radiotracers. We show, in humans, our method can resolve blood-brain barrier permeability across three radiotracers and demonstrate its utility in studying brain aging and brain-body interactions in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver inflammation. Our method opens new directions to effectively study the molecular permeability of the human blood-brain barrier in vivo using the large catalogue of available molecular positron emission tomography tracers.

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: CD30 serves as an ideal therapeutic target for lymphoma, but its variable expression and high relapse rate pose challenges in targeted therapy. This study aims to label the anti-CD30 monoclonal antibody with64Cu/177Lu for immuno-positron emission tomography (immuno-PET) and radioimmunotherapy (RIT).

Methods: CD30 binding kinetics of anti-CD30-IgG (IMB16) were measured by Biolayer interferometry (BLI). Western blotting screened lymphoma cell lines for CD30 expression. Flow cytometry and immunofluorescence validated the specific binding of IMB16. IMB16 was conjugated to p-SCN-Bn-NOTA(NOTA) and p-SCN-Bn-DOTA(DOTA) for radiolabeling with64Cu and177Lu. [64Cu]Cu-NOTA-IMB16 and [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-IMB16 were used for immuno-PET and RIT in subcutaneous lymphoma NSG mouse models.

Results: IMB16 had a strong binding affinity to CD30 according to the BLI. Western blotting revealed high CD30 expression in Karpas299 cells and negative expression in Raji cells. Flow cytometry and immunofluorescence confirmed specific binding of IMB16 to CD30 on cell surface. Radiochemical purity of [64Cu]Cu-NOTA-IMB16 and [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-IMB16 exceeded 95%. In Immuno-PET imaging, CD30-positive Karpas299 tumours had a mean uptake value of 19.2 ± 0.9%ID/g (n = 3) at 24 h post-injection, significantly higher than Karpas299-blocked and Raji-negative groups (P < 0.001). A high radiation dose (300µCi) of [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-IMB16 significantly inhibited tumour growth (80.2 ± 17.6% standardized tumour volume, n = 5) at 10 days post-injection, compared to controls. Ex vivo biodistribution and histological staining supported in vivo PET imaging and RIT results.

Conclusions: Labelling IMB16 with64Cu enabled non-invasive assessment of CD30 expression, while177Lu labelling effectively suppressed tumour growth in CD30-positive lymphoma. CD30-targeted theranostic show promise for patient stratification and treatment enhancement, warranting further clinical evaluation.

JOURNAL: Journal of labelled compounds & radiopharmaceuticals

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
CuI-mediated11C-cyanation was evaluated by synthesizing [11C]perampanel ([11C]5) as a model compound and compared with previous reports. To a DMF solution with 5'-(2-bromophenyl)-1'-phenyl-[2,3'-bipyridin]-6'(1'H)-one (4) and CuI, [11C]NH4CN in a stream of ammonia/nitrogen (5:95, v/v) gas was bubbled. Subsequently, the reaction mixture was heated at 180°C for 5 min. After HPLC purification, [11C]5 was obtained in 7.2 ± 1.0% (n = 4) non-decay corrected radiochemical yield with >99% radiochemical purity and a molar activity of 98 ± 28 GBq/μmol. In vivo evaluations of [11C]5 were performed using small animals. PET scans to check the kinetics of [11C]5 in the whole body of mice suggested that [11C]5 spreads rapidly into the brain, heart, and lungs and then accumulates in the small intestine. To evaluate the performance of CuI-mediated11C-cyanation reaction, bromobenzene (6a) was selected as the model compound; however, it failed. Therefore, optimization of the reaction conditions has been performed, and consequently, the addition of K2CO3and prolonging the reaction time improved the radiochemical yield about double. With this improved method, CuI-mediated11C-cyanation of various (hetero)aromatic bromides was performed to exhibit the tolerance of most functional groups and to provide11C-cyanated products in good to moderate radiochemical yields.

ABSTRACT:
The positron emission tomography radioligand [11C]UCB-J binds to synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2 A (SV2A), a regulator of vesicle release. Increased neuronal firing could potentially affect tracer concentrations if binding site availability is altered during vesicle exocytosis. This study assessed whether physiological brain activation induces changes in [11C]UCB-J tissue influx (K1), volume of distribution (VT), or binding potential (BPND). Healthy volunteers (n= 7) underwent 60-min [11C]UCB-J PET scans at baseline and during intermittent presentation of 8-Hz checkerboard visual stimulation. Sensitivity to intermittent changes in kinetic parameters was assessed in simulations, and visual stimulation was repeated using functional magnetic resonance imaging to characterize neural responses.VTandK1were determined using the one-tissue compartment model andBPNDusing the simplified reference tissue model. In primary visual cortex,K1increased 34.3 ± 15.5% (p= 0.001) during stimulation, with no change in other regions (ps>0.12).K1change was correlated with fMRI BOLD response (r = 0.77,p= 0.043). There was no change inVT(-3.9 ± 8.8%,p=0.33) orBPND(-0.2 ± 9.6%,p=0.94) in visual cortex nor other regions (ps>0.19). Therefore, despite robust increases in regional tracer influx due to blood flow increases, binding measures were unchanged during stimulation. [11C]UCB-JVTandBPNDare likely to be stable in vivo measures of synaptic density.

TITLE: Characterization in nonhuman primates of (R)-[18F]OF-Me-NB1 and (S)-[18F]OF-Me-NB1 for imaging the GluN2B subunits of the NMDA receptor

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: GluN2B containing N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) play an essential role in neurotransmission and are a potential treatment target for multiple neurological and neurodegenerative diseases, including stroke, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease. (R)-[18F]OF-Me-NB1 was reported to be more specific and selective than (S)-[18F]OF-Me-NB1 for the GluN2B subunits of the NMDAR based on their binding affinity to GluN2B and sigma-1 receptors. Here we report a comprehensive evaluation of (R)-[18F]OF-Me-NB1 and (S)-[18F]OF-Me-NB1 in nonhuman primates.

Methods: The radiosynthesis of (R)-[18F]OF-Me-NB1 and (S)-[18F]OF-Me-NB1 started from18F-fluorination of the boronic ester precursor, followed by removal of the acetyl protecting group. PET scans in two rhesus monkeys were conducted on the Focus 220 scanner. Blocking studies were performed after treatment of the animals with the GluN2B antagonist Co101,244 or the sigma-1 receptor antagonist FTC-146. One-tissue compartment (1TC) model and multilinear analysis-1 (MA1) method with arterial input function were used to obtain the regional volume of distribution (VT, mL/cm3). Occupancy values by the two blockers were obtained by the Lassen plot. Regional non-displaceable binding potential (BPND) was calculated from the corresponding baseline VTand the VNDderived from the occupancy plot of the Co101,244 blocking scans.

Results: (R)- and (S)-[18F]OF-Me-NB1 were produced in > 99% radiochemical and enantiomeric purity, with molar activity of 224.22 ± 161.69 MBq/nmol at the end of synthesis (n = 10). Metabolism was moderate, with ~ 30% parent compound remaining for (R)-[18F]OF-Me-NB1 and 20% for (S)-[18F]OF-Me-NB1 at 30 min postinjection. Plasma free fraction was 1-2%. In brain regions, both (R)- and (S)-[18F]OF-Me-NB1 displayed fast uptake with slower clearance for the (R)- than (S)-enantiomer. For (R)-[18F]OF-Me-NB1, both the 1TC model and MA1 method gave reliable estimates of regional VTvalues, with MA1 VT(mL/cm3) values ranging from 8.9 in the cerebellum to 12.8 in the cingulate cortex. Blocking with 0.25 mg/kg of Co101,244 greatly reduced the uptake of (R)-[18F]OF-Me-NB1 across all brain regions, resulting in occupancy of 77% and VNDof 6.36, while 0.027 mg/kg of FTC-146 reduced specific binding by 30%. Regional BPND, as a measure of specific binding signals, ranged from 0.40 in the cerebellum to 1.01 in the cingulate cortex.

Conclusions: In rhesus monkeys, (R)-[18F]OF-Me-NB1 exhibited fast kinetics and heterogeneous uptake across brain regions, while the (S)-enantiomer displayed a narrower dynamic range of uptake across regions. A Blocking study with a GluN2B antagonist indicated binding specificity. The value of BPNDwas > 0.5 in most brain regions, suggesting good in vivo specific binding signals. Taken together, results from the current study demonstrated the potential of (R)-[18F]OF-Me-NB1 as a useful radiotracer for imaging the GluN2B receptors.

TITLE: Establishment of a Mouse Ovarian Cancer and Peritoneal Metastasis Model to Study Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy

AUTHORS: Günther A Rezniczek, Jonathan Buggisch, Julien Sobilo, Alexandre Launay, Stéphanie Lerondel, Alain Le Pape, Mehdi Ouaissi, Daniel Göhler, Metin Senkal, Urs Giger-Pabst, Clemens B Tempfer

JOURNAL: Cancers

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Intraperitoneal chemotherapy (IPC) is a locoregional treatment option in patients with peritoneal metastases (PM). Here, we present an ovarian cancer (OC)-derived PM mouse model for the study of different forms of IPC. Xenograft cell proliferation (luciferase-transfected OVCAR3 and SKOV3 clones) and growth kinetics were assessed using PET scan, bioluminescence imaging (BLI), and histological tumor analysis. Liquid IPC was achieved by intraperitoneal injection with/without capnoperitoneum (6-7 mmHg). Pressurized intraperitoneal aerosol chemotherapy (PIPAC) was mimicked using an intratracheal drug aerosol administration system (micro-nozzle), which, as demonstrated by ex vivo granulometric analysis using laser diffraction spectrometry, produced a polydisperse, bimodal aerosol with a volume-weighted median diameter of (26.49 ± 2.76) µm. Distribution of Tc-99m-labeled doxorubicin in mice was characterized using SPECT and was dependent on the delivery mode and most homogeneous when the micro-nozzle was used. A total of 2 mg doxorubicin per kg body weight was determined to be the optimally effective and tolerable dose to achieve at least 50% tumor reduction. Repeated PIPAC (four times at seven-day-intervals) with doxorubicin in SKOV3-luc tumor-bearing mice resulted in halted tumor proliferation and tumor load reduced after the second round of PIPAC versus controls and the number of tumor nodules was significantly reduced (27.7 ± 9.5 vs. 57.3 ± 9.5;p= 0.0003). Thus, we established the first mouse model of OC PM for the study of IPC using a human xenograft with SKOV3 cells and an experimental IPC setup with a miniaturized nozzle. Repeated IPC was feasible and demonstrated time-dependent anti-tumor activity.

TITLE: Fibroblast Activation Protein Inhibitor Theranostics: Preclinical Considerations

AUTHORS: Kazuko Kaneda-Nakashima, Yoshifumi Shirakami, Yuichiro Kadonaga, Tadashi Watabe

JOURNAL: PET clinics

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Fibroblast activation protein (FAP) was first reported in 1986. However, FAP is not expressed in normal fibroblasts, normal or malignant epithelial cells, or the stroma of benign epithelial tumors. FAP is a cell membrane-bound serine peptidase overexpressed on the surface of cancer-associated fibroblasts and, as such, is a novel target for molecular imaging of several tumors. FAP inhibitors (FAPI) are potential theranostic molecular probes for various cancers. A tumor model expressing FAP was used to verify or confirm the usefulness of FAPI experimentally.

TITLE: 18F-labeling and initial in vivo evaluation of a Hitomi peptide for imaging tissue transglutaminase 2

AUTHORS: Uwe Ackermann, Luise Jäger, Angela Rigopoulos, Ingrid Julienne Georgette Burvenich, Graeme Joseph O'Keefe, Andrew M Scott

JOURNAL: Nuclear medicine and biology

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Introduction: Tissue transglutaminase 2 (TG2) is a calcium-dependent enzyme which cross-links proteins. It is overexpressed in many diseases and plays a key role in tissue remodeling, including cell adhesion and migration. Overexpression of TG2 in breast cancer is a marker for patients at risk of recurrence. Non-invasive imaging of TG2 can therefore play an important role in patient management. TG2 probes labeled with the positron emitters11C and18F have thus far not found widespread application due to purity and metabolism issues. Our approach was to radiolabel a TG2 selective, 13-mer amino acid peptide, which was modified with a 5-azidopentanoic acid group at the N-terminus via a copper free click chemistry approach.

Methods: Radiochemistry was performed and fully automated using an iPhase FlexLab module. We produced the radiolabeling synthon [18F]FBz-DBCO from [18F]SFB and DBCO-amine. After HPLC purification, [18F]FBz-DBCO was reacted with the modified peptide and the putative radiotracer purified by HPLC. In vivo imaging using the radiolabeled amine was performed in mice bearing either TG2 expressing MDA-MB-231 or non-TG2 expressing MCF-7 xenografts as negative control. Expression of the target was confirmed using immunohistochemistry and western blot techniques.

Results: We obtained 9 ± 2 GBq of the radiolabeled peptide from 55 ± 5 GBq of fluorine-18 in an overall synthesis time of 160 min from end of bombardment (EOB), including HPLC purification and reformulation. Small animal PET/MR imaging showed that visualization of MDA-MB-231 tumors using the radiolabeled peptide could only be achieved due to differences in clearance between tumor and surrounding tissue. In the MCF-7 xenograft model, radiotracer clearance from tumor and surrounding tissue occurred at a similar rate, thus making it impossible to visualize MCF-7 tumors. The presence of TG2 in MDA-MB-231 tumors and absence in MCF-7 tumors was confirmed by immunohistochemistry staining and western blot analysis.

Conclusion: A fully automated synthesis of a TG2 selective, 13-amino-acid peptide modified with 5-azido pentynoic acid at the N-terminal was established using [18F]FBzDBCO as a prosthetic group. Although our results show that radiolabeled peptides have potential as imaging agents for TG2, more research needs to be performed to improve radiotracer kinetics.

JOURNAL: Acta neuropathologica communications

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and corticobasal degeneration (CBD) are distinct clinicopathological subtypes of frontotemporal lobar degeneration. They both have atypical parkinsonism, and they usually have distinct clinical features. The most common clinical presentation of PSP is Richardson syndrome, and the most common presentation of CBD is corticobasal syndrome. In this report, we describe a patient with a five-year history of Richardson syndrome and a family history of PSP in her mother and sister. A tau PET scan (18F-APN-1607) revealed low-to-moderate uptake in the substantia nigra, globus pallidus, thalamus and posterior cortical areas, including temporal, parietal and occipital cortices. Neuropathological evaluation revealed widespread neuronal and glial tau pathology in cortical and subcortical structures, including tufted astrocytes in the motor cortex, striatum and midbrain tegmentum. The subthalamic nucleus had mild-to-moderate neuronal loss with globose neurofibrillary tangles, consistent with PSP. On the other hand, there were also astrocytic plaques, a pathological hallmark of CBD, in the neocortex and striatum. To further characterize the mixed pathology, we applied two machine learning-based diagnostic pipelines. These models suggested diagnoses of PSP and CBD depending on the brain region - PSP in the motor cortex and superior frontal gyrus and CBD in caudate nucleus. Western blots of insoluble tau from motor cortex showed a banding pattern consistent with mixed features of PSP and CBD, whereas tau from the superior frontal gyrus showed a pattern consistent with CBD. Real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC) using brain homogenates from the motor cortex and superior frontal gyrus showed ThT maxima consistent with PSP, while reaction kinetics were consistent with CBD. There were no pathogenic variants in MAPT with whole genome sequencing. We conclude that this patient had an unclassified tauopathy and features of both PSP and CBD. The different pathologies in specific brain regions suggests caution in diagnosis of tauopathies with limited sampling.

TITLE: Gastrin-releasing peptide receptor as theranostic target in estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer: A preclinical study of the theranostic pair [55Co]Co- and [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-RM26

ABSTRACT:
Background: Patients with advanced metastatic estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer often develop resistance to standard treatments, leading to uncontrolled progression. Thus, innovative therapies are urgently needed. The gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR) is overexpressed in various cancers, including breast cancer, making it an interesting theranostic target. RM26, a GRPR-targeting antagonist, has demonstrated promising in vivo kinetics in prostate cancer models. This study evaluated the theranostic capabilities of [55Co]Co-/[177Lu]Lu-DOTA-RM26 in vitro in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cells and assessed the diagnostic potential of [55Co]Co-DOTA-RM26 in vivo in a breast cancer mouse model.

Methods: We analyzed the binding specificity of [57Co]Co-/[177Lu]Lu-DOTA-RM26 in T47D breast cancer cells, using [57Co]Co-DOTA-RM26 as a surrogate for [55Co]Co-DOTA-RM26. The therapeutic efficacy of increasing [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-RM26 concentrations was determined via viability assay in vitro. Ex vivo biodistribution of [57Co]Co-DOTA-RM26 (17.2 ± 2.7 kBq, 33 ± 5.2 pmol/mouse) was investigated in 12 mice (n= 4/group) with orthotopic breast cancer tumors. The mice were sacrificed at 4 and 24 h post-injection (pi), including a blocking group (20 nmol of unlabeled [Tyr4]-Bombesin) at 4 h pi. For imaging, two tumor-bearing mice underwent [55Co]Co-DOTA-RM26 PET/CT, 4 and 24 h pi (2.8 ± 0.2 MBq, 167.5 ± 0.5 pmol/mouse), with or without GRPR blocking.

Results: In vitro studies revealed high, specific binding of [57Co]Co-DOTA-RM26 (43 ± 1 % of total added activity per 106cells (%IA/106)) and [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-RM26 (37 ± 4 %IA/106). The activity was predominantly localized at the cell surface: 71 ± 3 % and 80 ± 6 % for [57Co]Co-DOTA-RM26 and [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-RM26, respectively. [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-RM26 significantly reduced cell viability at all activity concentrations >0.625 MBq/mL (p < 0.0001), with cell viability below 1 % at concentrations ≥5 MBq/mL. Biodistribution data (n = 12) indicated a high, specific tumor uptake of [57Co]Co-DOTA-RM26, surpassing all other tissues significantly at both time points, 3.7 ± 0.6 % of the injected activity per gram (%IA/g) 4 h pi and 0.98 ± 0.05 %IA/g 24 h pi. The kidneys showed the second-highest uptake (2.0 ± 0.1 %IA/g 4 h pi), followed by the pancreas (1.4 ± 0.4 %IA/g 4 h pi). PET/CT imaging with [55Co]Co-DOTA-RM26 supported the biodistribution data and, distinctly visualized the tumor 24 h pi and showed an improved tumor-to-background compared to the earlier time points. Effective GRPR blocking significantly reduced tumor uptake in the PET images 24 h pi.

Conclusion: These findings suggest that the theranostic pair [55Co]Co-/[177Lu]Lu-DOTA-RM26 holds significant promise as a theranostic agent for estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer.

TITLE: Cyclohexanediamine Triazole (CHDT) Functionalization Enables Labeling of Target Molecules with Al18F/68Ga/111In

JOURNAL: Bioconjugate chemistry

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
The Al18F-labeling approach offers a one-step access to radiofluorinated biomolecules by mimicking the labeling process for radiometals. Although these labeling conditions are considered to be mild compared to classic radiofluorinations, improvements of the chelating units have led to the discovery of(±)-H3RESCA, which allows Al18F-labeling already at ambient temperature. While the suitability of(±)-H3RESCAfor functionalization and radiofluorination of proteins is well established, its use for small molecules or peptides is less explored. Herein, we advanced this acyclic pentadentate ligand by introducing an alkyne moiety for the late-stage functionalization of biomolecules via click chemistry. We show that in addition to Al18F-labeling, the cyclohexanediamine triazole (CHDT) moiety allows stable complexation of68Ga and111In. Three novel CHDT-functionalized PSMA inhibitors were synthesized and their Al18F-,68Ga-, and111In-labeled analogs were subjected to a detailedin vitroradiopharmacological characterization. Stability studiesin vitroin human serum revealed among others a high kinetic inertness of all radiometal complexes. Furthermore, the Al18F-labeled PSMA ligands were characterized for their biodistribution in a LNCaP derived tumor xenograft mouse model by PET imaging. One radioligand,Al[18F]F-CHDT-PSMA-1, bearing a small azidoacetyl linker at the glutamate-urea-lysine motif, provided anin vivoperformance comparable to that of[18F]PSMA-1007but with even higher tumor-to-blood and tumor-to-muscle ratios at 120 minp.i.Overall, our results highlight the suitability of the novel CHDT moiety for functionalization and radiolabeling of small molecules or peptides with Al18F,68Ga, and111In and the triazole ring seems to entail favorable pharmacokinetic properties for molecular imaging purposes.

ABSTRACT:
TheN-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) plays a crucial role in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease and in the treatment of major depression by fast-acting antidepressants such as ketamine. Given their broad implications, GluN2B-containing NMDARs have been of interest as diagnostic and therapeutic targets. Recently, (R)-11C-Me-NB1 was investigated preclinically and shown to be a promising radioligand for imaging GluN2B subunits. Here, we report on the performance characteristics of this radioligand in a first-in-humans PET study.Methods:Six healthy male subjects were scanned twice on a fully integrated PET/MR scanner with (R)-11C-Me-NB1 for 120 min. Brain uptake and tracer distribution over time were investigated by SUVs. Test-retest reliability was assessed with the absolute percentage difference and the coefficient of variation. Exploratory total volumes of distribution (VT) were computed using an arterial input function and the Logan plot as well as a constrained 2-tissue-compartment model with the ratio of rate constants between plasma and tissue compartments (K1/k2) coupled (2TCM). SUV was correlated with VTto investigate its potential as a surrogate marker of GluN2B expression.Results:High and heterogeneous radioligand uptake was observed across the entire gray matter with reversible kinetics within the scan time. SUV absolute percentage difference ranged from 6.9% to 8.5% and coefficient of variation from 4.9% to 6.0%, indicating a high test-retest reliability. A moderate correlation was found between SUV averaged from 70 to 90 min and VTusing Logan plot (Spearman ρ = 0.44). Correlation between VTLogan and 2TCM wasr= 0.76.Conclusion:The radioligand (R)-11C-Me-NB1 was highly effective in mapping GluN2B-enriched NMDARs in the human brain. With a heterogeneous uptake and a high test-retest reliability, this radioligand offers promise to deepen our understanding of the GluN2B-containing NMDAR in the pathophysiology and treatment of neuropsychiatric disease such as Alzheimer disease and major depression. Additionally, it could help in the selection of appropriate doses of GluN2B-targeting drugs.

ABSTRACT:
Global plastic production exceeded 400 million tons in 2022, urgently demanding improved waste management and recycling strategies for a circular plastic economy. While the enzymatic hydrolysis of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) has become feasible on industrial scales, efficient enzymes targeting other hydrolyzable plastic types, such as polyurethanes (PURs), are lacking. Recently, enzymes of the amidase signature (AS) family, capable of cleaving urethane bonds in a polyether-PUR analog and a linear polyester-PUR, have been identified. Herein, we present high-resolution crystal structures of the AS enzyme UMG-SP3 in three states: ligand-free, bound with a suicidal inhibitor mimicking the transition state, and bound with a monomeric PUR degradation product. Besides revealing the conserved core and catalytic triad akin to other AS family members, the UMG-SP3 structures show remarkable flexibility of loop regions. Particularly, Arg209 in loop 3 adopts two induced-fit conformations upon ligand binding. Through structure-guided kinetic studies and enzyme engineering, we mapped structural key elements that determine the enhanced hydrolysis of urethane and amide bonds in various small molecules, including a linear PUR fragment analog. Our findings contribute critical insights into urethanase activity, aiding PUR degradation campaigns and sustainable plastic recycling efforts in the future.

ABSTRACT:
Background: The amyloid probability score (APS) is the model read-out of the analytically validated mass spectrometry-based PrecivityAD®blood test that incorporates the plasma Aβ42/40 ratio, ApoE proteotype, and age to identify the likelihood of brain amyloid plaques among cognitively impaired individuals being evaluated for Alzheimer's disease.

Purpose: This study aimed to provide additional independent evidence that the pre-established APS algorithm, along with its cutoff values, discriminates between amyloid positive and negative individuals.

Methods: The diagnostic performance of the PrecivityAD test was analyzed in a cohort of 200 nonrandomly selected Australian Imaging, Biomarker & Lifestyle Flagship Study of Aging (AIBL) study participants, who were either cognitively impaired or healthy controls, and for whom a blood sample and amyloid PET imaging were available.

Results: In a subset of the dataset aligned with the Intended Use population (patients aged 60 and older with CDR ≥0.5), the pre-established APS algorithm predicted amyloid PET with a sensitivity of 84.9% (CI: 72.9-92.1%) and specificity of 96% (CI: 80.5-99.3%), exclusive of 13 individuals for whom the test was inconclusive.

Interpretation: The study shows individuals with a high APS are more likely than those with a low APS to have abnormal amounts of amyloid plaques and be on an amyloid accumulation trajectory, a dynamic and evolving process characteristic of progressive AD pathology. Exploratory data suggest APS retains its diagnostic performance in healthy individuals, supporting further screening studies in the cognitively unimpaired.

TITLE: Sensor-based physical activity, sedentary time, and reported cell phone screen time: A hierarchy of correlates in youth

AUTHORS: Pedro B Júdice, João P Magalhães, Gil B Rosa, Duarte Henriques-Neto, Megan Hetherington-Rauth, Luís B Sardinha

JOURNAL: Journal of sport and health science

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Background: Evidence on correlates relies on subjective metrics and fails to include correlates across all levels of the ecologic model. We determined which correlates best predict sensor-based physical activity (PA), sedentary time (ST), and self-reported cell phone screen time (CST) in a large sample of youth, while considering a multiplicity of correlates.

Methods: Using sensor-based accelerometry, we assessed the PA and ST of 2179 youths. A χ2automatic interaction detection algorithm was used to hierarchize the correlates associated with too much ST (> 50th percentile), insufficient moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) (<60 min/day), and prolonged CST (≥2 h/day).

Results: Among youth 10-14 years old, the correlates for being inactive consisted of being a girl, not having sport facilities in the neighborhood, and not perceiving the neighborhood as a safe place, whereas in the youth 15-18 years old, the correlate for being inactive was not performing sports (9.7% chance of being active). The correlates for predicting high ST in the younger group was not performing sports (55.8% chance for high ST), and in the older group, the correlates were not owning a pet, perceiving the neighborhood as safe, and having inactive parents (63.7% chance for high ST). In the younger group, the greatest chances of having high CST were among those who were in the last elementary school years, who were girls, and who did not have friends in the neighborhood (73.1% chance for high CST), whereas in the older group, the greatest chance for having high CST was among those who were girls and had a TV in the bedroom (74.3% chance for high CST).

Conclusion: To counteract ST and boost MVPA among youths, a specific focus on girls, the promotion of sport participation and facilities, neighborhood safety, and involvement of family must be prioritized.

TITLE: [18F]FMISO-PET imaging reveals the role of hypoxia severity in checkpoint blockade response

AUTHORS: Kaytlyn C McNeal, Kirsten M Reeves, Patrick N Song, Suzanne E Lapi, Anna G Sorace, Benjamin M Larimer

JOURNAL: Nuclear medicine and biology

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Context: Hypoxia within the tumor microenvironment is a critical factor influencing the efficacy of immunotherapy, including immune checkpoint inhibition. Insufficient oxygen supply, characteristic of hypoxia, has been recognized as a central determinant in the progression of various cancers. The reemergence of evofosfamide, a hypoxia-activated prodrug, as a potential treatment strategy has sparked interest in addressing the role of hypoxia in immunotherapy response. This investigation sought to understand the kinetics and heterogeneity of tumor hypoxia and their implications in affecting responses to immunotherapeutic interventions with and without evofosfamide.

Purpose: This study aimed to investigate the influence of hypoxia on immune checkpoint inhibition, evofosfamide monotherapy, and their combination on colorectal cancer (CRC). Employing positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, we developed novel analytical methods to quantify and characterize tumor hypoxia severity and distribution.

Procedures: Murine CRC models were longitudinally imaged with [18F]-fluoromisonidazole (FMISO)-PET to quantify tumor hypoxia during checkpoint blockade (anti-CTLA-4 + and anti-PD1 +/- evofosfamide). Metrics including maximum tumor [18F]FMISO uptake (FMISOmax) and mean tumor [18F]FMISO uptake (FMISOmean) were quantified and compared with normal muscle tissue (average muscle FMISO uptake (mAvg) and muscle standard deviation (mSD)). Histogram distributions were used to evaluate heterogeneity of tumor hypoxia.

Findings: Severe hypoxia significantly impeded immunotherapy effectiveness consistent with an immunosuppressive microenvironment. Hypoxia-specific PET imaging revealed a striking degree of spatial heterogeneity in tumor hypoxia, with some regions exhibiting significantly more severe hypoxia than others. The study identified FMISOmax as a robust predictor of immunotherapy response, emphasizing the impact of localized severe hypoxia on tumor volume control during therapy. Interestingly, evofosfamide did not directly reduce hypoxia but markedly improved the response to immunotherapy, uncovering an alternative mechanism for its efficacy.

Conclusions: These results enhance our comprehension of the interplay between hypoxia and immune checkpoint inhibition within the tumor microenvironment, offering crucial insights for the development of personalized cancer treatment strategies. Non-invasive hypoxia quantification through molecular imaging evaluating hypoxia severity may be an effective tool in guiding treatment planning, predicting therapy response, and ultimately improving patient outcomes across diverse cancer types and tumor microenvironments. It sets the stage for the translation of these findings into clinical practice, facilitating the optimization of immunotherapy regimens by addressing tumor hypoxia and thereby enhancing the efficacy of cancer treatments.

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Background Visual assessment of amyloid PET scans relies on the availability of radiologist expertise, whereas quantification of amyloid burden typically involves MRI for processing and analysis, which can be computationally expensive. Purpose To develop a deep learning model to classify minimally processed brain PET scans as amyloid positive or negative, evaluate its performance on independent data sets and different tracers, and compare it with human visual reads. Materials and Methods This retrospective study used 8476 PET scans (6722 patients) obtained from late 2004 to early 2023 that were analyzed across five different data sets. A deep learning model, AmyloidPETNet, was trained on 1538 scans from 766 patients, validated on 205 scans from 95 patients, and internally tested on 184 scans from 95 patients in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) fluorine 18 (18F) florbetapir (FBP) data set. It was tested on ADNI scans using different tracers and scans from independent data sets. Scan amyloid positivity was based on mean cortical standardized uptake value ratio cutoffs. To compare with model performance, each scan from both the Centiloid Project and a subset of the Anti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic Alzheimer's Disease (A4) study were visually interpreted with a confidence level (low, intermediate, high) of amyloid positivity/negativity. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and other performance metrics were calculated, and Cohen κ was used to measure physician-model agreement. Results The model achieved an AUC of 0.97 (95% CI: 0.95, 0.99) on test ADNI18F-FBP scans, which generalized well to18F-FBP scans from the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (AUC, 0.95; 95% CI: 0.93, 0.97) and the A4 study (AUC, 0.98; 95% CI: 0.98, 0.98). Model performance was high when applied to data sets with different tracers (AUC ≥ 0.97). Other performance metrics provided converging evidence. Physician-model agreement ranged from fair (Cohen κ = 0.39; 95% CI: 0.16, 0.60) on a sample of mostly equivocal cases from the A4 study to almost perfect (Cohen κ = 0.93; 95% CI: 0.86, 1.0) on the Centiloid Project. Conclusion The developed model was capable of automatically and accurately classifying brain PET scans as amyloid positive or negative without relying on experienced readers or requiring structural MRI.

TITLE: In vitro fermentation characteristics of dietary fibers using fecal inoculum from dogs consuming commercial or grain kefir

AUTHORS: Breanna N Metras, Patricia M Oba, Dalton A Holt, Laura L Bauer, Michael J Miller, Ryan N Dilger, Kelly S Swanson

JOURNAL: Journal of animal science

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Traditional grain kefir is produced from the fermentation of milk with yeast- and bacteria-containing cultures. To maintain consistency and adhere to food safety guidelines, commercial kefir products are based on starter bacterial cultures. Bacterial profiles of starter vs. grain kefirs differ, and their influence on health effects is unknown. Our objectives were to determine the in vitro fermentation characteristics of common dietary fibers using fecal inoculum from dogs supplemented with kefir or kefir bacterial culture as inoculum. Healthy adult dogs were allotted to one of 3 treatments and supplemented for 14 d (n = 4/treatment): 1) 2% reduced-fat milk treated with lactase (CNTL), 2) starter kefir (S-Kefir), or 3) grain kefir (G-Kefir). After 14 d, fresh fecal samples were collected and frozen in a 20% glycerol solution. For the in vitro experiment, fecal samples were thawed, diluted in an anaerobic diluting solution, and used to inoculate tubes containing semi-defined medium and either cellulose (CEL), pectin (PC), beet pulp (BP), or chicory pulp (CP). Tubes were incubated for 0, 6, 12, or 18 h, with short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), pH, and microbiota measured at each time point. A second in vitro experiment was conducted using similar methods and measurements but with S-Kefir and G-Kefir as inoculum sources. Effects of treatment (inoculum), time, and treatment*time interactions within the fiber source were analyzed statistically using Mixed Models and repeated measures, with P < 0.05 being significant. Using fecal inoculum, BP and PC were rapidly fermented, leading to large pH reductions, SCFA increases, and microbiota shifts. pH change was of greater (P < 0.05) magnitude (PC) and higher (P < 0.05) kinetic rate (CP) when using feces from dogs fed S-Kefir or G-Kefir than controls. Butyrate increases were greater (P < 0.05) in tubes inoculated with G-Kefir feces than in S-Kefir or control feces. When PC and BP were fermented, tubes with S-Kefir feces had greater (P < 0.05) acetate, propionate, and total SCFA increases than G-Kefir or control feces. Fermentations were slower when using kefir cultures as inoculum, but some differences were noted. Bacterial beta diversity and relative abundances shifted over time within each substrate and were unique to the inoculum source. Our data suggest that the activity of kefir bacterial populations differs and that kefir consumption changes the abundance and activity of the fecal microbiota of dogs, justifying in vivo investigation.

JOURNAL: JAMA network open

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Importance: The diagnostic evaluation for Alzheimer disease may be improved by a blood-based diagnostic test identifying presence of brain amyloid plaque pathology.

Objective: To determine the clinical performance associated with a diagnostic algorithm incorporating plasma amyloid-β (Aβ) 42:40 ratio, patient age, and apoE proteotype to identify brain amyloid status.

Design, setting, and participants: This cohort study includes analysis from 2 independent cross-sectional cohort studies: the discovery cohort of the Plasma Test for Amyloidosis Risk Screening (PARIS) study, a prospective add-on to the Imaging Dementia-Evidence for Amyloid Scanning study, including 249 patients from 2018 to 2019, and MissionAD, a dataset of 437 biobanked patient samples obtained at screenings during 2016 to 2019. Data were analyzed from May to November 2020.

Exposures: Amyloid detected in blood and by positron emission tomography (PET) imaging.

Main outcomes and measures: The main outcome was the diagnostic performance of plasma Aβ42:40 ratio, together with apoE proteotype and age, for identifying amyloid PET status, assessed by accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).

Results: All 686 participants (mean [SD] age 73.2 [6.3] years; 368 [53.6%] men; 378 participants [55.1%] with amyloid PET findings) had symptoms of mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia. The AUC of plasma Aβ42:40 ratio for PARIS was 0.79 (95% CI, 0.73-0.85) and 0.86 (95% CI, 0.82-0.89) for MissionAD. Ratio cutoffs for Aβ42:40 based on the Youden index were similar between cohorts (PARIS: 0.089; MissionAD: 0.092). A logistic regression model (LRM) incorporating Aβ42:40 ratio, apoE proteotype, and age improved diagnostic performance within each cohort (PARIS: AUC, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.81-0.91]; MissionAD: AUC, 0.89 [95% CI, 0.86-0.92]), and overall accuracy was 78% (95% CI, 72%-83%) for PARIS and 83% (95% CI, 79%-86%) for MissionAD. The model developed on the prospectively collected samples from PARIS performed well on the MissionAD samples (AUC, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.84-0.91]; accuracy, 78% [95% CI, 74%-82%]). Training the LRM on combined cohorts yielded an AUC of 0.88 (95% CI, 0.85-0.91) and accuracy of 81% (95% CI, 78%-84%). The output of this LRM is the Amyloid Probability Score (APS). For clinical use, 2 APS cutoff values were established yielding 3 categories, with low, intermediate, and high likelihood of brain amyloid plaque pathology.

Conclusions and relevance: These findings suggest that this blood biomarker test could allow for distinguishing individuals with brain amyloid-positive PET findings from individuals with amyloid-negative PET findings and serve as an aid for Alzheimer disease diagnosis.

TITLE: Identification and Characterization of ML321: A Novel and Highly Selective D2 Dopamine Receptor Antagonist with Efficacy in Animal Models That Predict Atypical Antipsychotic Activity

JOURNAL: ACS pharmacology & translational science

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
We have developed and characterized a novel D2R antagonist with exceptional GPCR selectivity - ML321. In functional profiling screens of 168 different GPCRs, ML321 showed little activity beyond potent inhibition of the D2R and to a lesser extent the D3R, demonstrating excellent receptor selectivity. The D2R selectivity of ML321 may be related to the fact that, unlike other monoaminergic ligands, ML321 lacks a positively charged amine group and adopts a unique binding pose within the orthosteric binding site of the D2R. PET imaging studies in non-human primates demonstrated that ML321 penetrates the CNS and occupies the D2R in a dose-dependent manner. Behavioral paradigms in rats demonstrate that ML321 can selectively antagonize a D2R-mediated response (hypothermia) while not affecting a D3R-mediated response (yawning) using the same dose of drug, thus indicating exceptionalin vivoselectivity. We also investigated the effects of ML321 in animal models that are predictive of antipsychotic efficacy in humans. We found that ML321 attenuates both amphetamine- and phencyclidine-induced locomotor activity and restored pre-pulse inhibition (PPI) of acoustic startle in a dose-dependent manner. Surprisingly, using doses that were maximally effective in both the locomotor and PPI studies, ML321 was relatively ineffective in promoting catalepsy. Kinetic studies revealed that ML321 exhibits slow-on and fast-off receptor binding rates, similar to those observed with atypical antipsychotics with reduced extrapyramidal side effects. Taken together, these observations suggest that ML321, or a derivative thereof, may exhibit ″atypical″ antipsychotic activity in humans with significantly fewer side effects than observed with the currently FDA-approved D2R antagonists.

ABSTRACT:
To enhance tumor uptake and retention, we designed and developed bi-specific heterodimeric radiotracers targeting both FAP and αvβ3, [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-RGD. The present study aimed to evaluate the specificity, pharmacokinetics, and dosimetry of [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-RGD by preclinical and preliminary clinical studies.Methods:FAPI-RGD was designed and synthesized with the quinoline-based FAPI-02 and the cyclic RGDfK peptide. Preclinical pharmacokinetics were determined in Panc02 xenograft model using microPET and biodistribution experiments. The safety and effective dosimetry of [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-RGD was evaluated in 6 cancer patients, and compared with 2-[18F]FDG imaging.Results:The [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-RGD had good stability in saline for at least 4 h, and showed favorable binding affinity and specificityin vitroandin vivo. Compared to [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-02 and [68Ga]Ga-RGDfK, the tumor uptake and retention of [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-RGD were very much enhanced than its monomeric counterparts at all the time points examined by microPET imaging. A total of 6 patients with various malignant tumors were prospectively enrolled. The effective dose of [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-RGD was 1.94E-02 mSv/MBq. The biodistribution of [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-RGD from 0 to 2 h after injection demonstrated rapid and high tumor uptake, prolonged tumor retention, and high tumor-to-background ratios (TBRs) which further increased over time. No significant difference in mean SUVmax of [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-RGD and 2-[18F]FDG was present in primary tumors (8.9±3.2vs.10.3 ± 6.9; p = 0.459).Conclusion:The dual targeting PET tracer [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-RGD showed significantly improved tumor uptake and retention, as well as cleaner background over68Ga-labeled FAPI and RGD monospecific tracers. The first-in-human biodistribution study showed high TBRs over time, suggesting high diagnostic performance and favorable tracer kinetics for potential therapeutic applications.

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: This study explored the feasibility of reducing the scan time of Patlak parametric imaging on the uEXPLORER.

Methods: A total of 65 patients (27 females and 38 males, age 56.1 ± 10.4) were recruited in this study. 18F fluorodeoxyglucose was injected, and its dose was adjusted by body weight (4.07 MBq/kg). Total-body dynamic scanning was performed on the uEXPLORER total-body Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (CT) scanner with a total scan time of 60 min from the injection. The image derived input function (IDIF) was obtained from the aortic arch. The voxelwise Patlak analysis was applied to generate the Kiimages designated as GIDIFwith different acquisition times (20-60, 30-60, 40-60, and 44-60 min). The population-based input function (PBIF) was constructed from the mean value of the IDIF from the population, and Kiimages designated as GPBIFwere generated using the PBIF. Nonlocalmeans (NLM) denoising was applied to the generated images to get two extra groups of (NLM-designated) images: GIDIF+NLMand GPBIF+NLM. Two radiologists evaluated the overall image quality, noise, and lesion detectability of the Kiimages from different groups. The 20-60 min scans in GIDIFwere selected as the gold standard for each patient. We determined that image quality is at sufficient level if all the lesions can be recognized and meet the clinical criteria. Kivalues in muscle and lesion were compared across different groups to evaluate the quantitative accuracy.

Results: The overall image quality, image noise, and lesion conspicuity were significantly better in long time series than short time series in all four groups (all p < 0.001). The Kiimages in the GIDIFand GPBIFgroups generated from 30-min scans showed diagnostic value equivalent to the 40-min scans of GIDIF. While the image quality of the 16-min scans was poor, all lesions could still be detected. No significant difference was found between Kivalues estimated with GIDIFand GPBIFin muscle and lesion regions (all p > 0.5). After applying the NLM filter, the coefficient of variation could be reduced on the order of (1%, 15%, 19%, and 37%) and (110%, 125%, 94%, and 69%) with four acquisition time schemes for lesion and muscle. The reduction percentage did not have a substantial difference in IDIF and PBIF group. The Kiimages in the GIDIF+NLMand GPBIF+NLMgroups generated from the 20-min acquisitions showed acceptable quality. All lesions could be found on the NLM processed images of the 16-min scans. No significant difference was found between Kivalues produced with GIDIF+NLMand GPBIF+NLMin muscle and lesion regions(all p > 0.7).

Conclusions: The Kiimages generated by the PBIF-based Patlak model using a 20-min dynamic scan with the NLM filter achieved a similar diagnostic efficiency to images with GIDIFfrom 40-min dynamic data, and there is no significant difference between Kiimages generated using IDIF or PBIF (p > 0.5).

ABSTRACT:
Intravitreal injections are the standard procedure in the treatment of retinal pathologies, such as the administration of the anti-VEGF antibodies in age-related macular degeneration. The aim of this study is to evaluate the intraocular and blood pharmacokinetics after an intravitreal injection of89Zr-labelled bevacizumab and89Zr-labelled aflibercept in Sprague-Dawley rats using Positron Emission Tomography. First, both antibodies were radiolabelled to zirconium-89 with a maximum specific activity of 15 Mbq/mg for bevacizumab and 10 Mbq/mg for aflibercept. Four µL containing 1-1.2 Mq of89Zr-labelled compound were injected into the vitreous through a 35 G needle. A microPET acquisition was carried out immediately after the injection and at different time points through a 12-day study and blood samples were obtained through the tail vein. Radiolabelling was successfully performed with a radiochemical purity after ultrafiltration above 95% for both agents. Both antibodies ocular curves followed a two-compartment model in which an intraocular elimination half-life of 16.44 h was found for89Zr-bevacizumab and 4.51 h for89Zr-aflibercept, considering the alpha phase as the elimination phase. Regarding the beta phase, a half-life of 3.23 days for89Zr-bevacizumab and 4.69 days for89Zr-aflibercept were observed. With regards to blood concentration,89Zr-bevacizumab showed a blood half-life of 7.08 days, whereas89Zr-aflibercept's was 3.18 days, by a one-compartment model with first-order absorption kinetics. In conclusion, this study shows for the first time the ocular and blood pharmacokinetic analysis after intravitreal injection of aflibercept and bevacizumab in rats.

ABSTRACT:
To evaluate tumor blood flow using15O-water positron emission tomography (PET) in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) before and after chemotherapy with bevacizumab, and to investigate the effects of bevacizumab on tumor blood flow changes and progression-free survival (PFS). Twelve patients with NSCLC were enrolled. Six patients underwent chemotherapy with bevacizumab and the other six without bevacizumab.15O-water dynamic PET scans were performed within 1 week before the start of chemotherapy and within 1 week after the first day of chemotherapy. Tumor blood flow was analyzed quantitatively using a single one-tissue compartment model with the correction of pulmonary circulation blood volume and arterial blood volume via an image-derived input function. In the bevacizumab group, mean tumor blood flow was statistically significantly reduced post-chemotherapy (pre-chemotherapy 0.27 ± 0.14 mL/cm3/min, post-chemotherapy 0.18 ± 0.12 mL/cm3/min). In the no bevacizumab group, there was no significant difference between mean tumor perfusion pre-chemotherapy (0.42 ± 0.42 mL/cm3/min) and post-chemotherapy (0.40 ± 0.27 mL/cm3/min). In the bevacizumab group, there was a positive correlation between the blood flow ratio (tumor blood flow post-chemotherapy/tumor blood flow pre-chemotherapy) and PFS (correlation coefficient 0.94). Mean tumor blood flow decreases after bevacizumab administration and was positively correlated with longer PFS.

TITLE: Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-Cell Therapy and Imaging Applications for Large B-Cell Lymphoma

AUTHORS: Nicola Mulholland, Julie Chandra, Robin Sanderson, Andrea Kuhnl

JOURNAL: Radiology

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has revolutionized the treatment of large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL) and other hematologic malignancies. Its mechanism of action relies on recent biotechnological advances that allow clinicians to harness and enhance a patient's immune system to fight cancerous cells. The indications for CAR T-cell therapy continue to expand, with ongoing trials evaluating their use in other hematologic and solid organ malignancies. This review explores the vital role of diagnostic imaging in patient selection and treatment response in CAR T-cell therapy for LBCL and the management of specific therapy-related adverse events. For a patient-centered and cost-effective use of CAR T-cell therapy, it is crucial to select patients who are likely to derive long-term benefit and optimize their care during a lengthy treatment pathway. Metabolic tumor volume and kinetics assessed at PET/CT have emerged as powerful tools to predict outcome after CAR T-cell therapy in LBCL, allowing for the early identification of lesions refractory to treatment and identification of the severity of CAR T-cell therapy toxicity. Radiologists should be aware that the success of CAR T-cell therapy is mitigated by adverse events, most importantly neurotoxicity, which remains poorly understood and challenging to treat. Neuroimaging, with experienced clinical evaluation, is critical in the diagnosis and management of neurotoxicity and the exclusion of other central nervous system complications that can occur in this clinically vulnerable patient group. This review discusses current applications of imaging in the standard CAR T-cell therapy pathway for the treatment of LBCL, which serves as a model disease in the integration of diagnostic imaging and radiomic risk markers.

TITLE: Multimodal brain age estimates relate to Alzheimer disease biomarkers and cognition in early stages: a cross-sectional observational study

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Background: Estimates of 'brain-predicted age' quantify apparent brain age compared to normative trajectories of neuroimaging features. The brain age gap (BAG) between predicted and chronological age is elevated in symptomatic Alzheimer disease (AD) but has not been well explored in presymptomatic AD. Prior studies have typically modeled BAG with structural MRI, but more recently other modalities, including functional connectivity (FC) and multimodal MRI, have been explored.

Methods: We trained three models to predict age from FC, structural (S), or multimodal MRI (S+FC) in 390 amyloid-negative cognitively normal (CN/A-) participants (18-89 years old). In independent samples of 144 CN/A-, 154 CN/A+, and 154 cognitively impaired (CI; CDR > 0) participants, we tested relationships between BAG and AD biomarkers of amyloid and tau, as well as a global cognitive composite.

Results: All models predicted age in the control training set, with the multimodal model outperforming the unimodal models. All three BAG estimates were significantly elevated in CI compared to controls. FC-BAG was significantly reduced in CN/A+ participants compared to CN/A-. In CI participants only, elevated S-BAG and S+FC BAG were associated with more advanced AD pathology and lower cognitive performance.

Conclusions: Both FC-BAG and S-BAG are elevated in CI participants. However, FC and structural MRI also capture complementary signals. Specifically, FC-BAG may capture a unique biphasic response to presymptomatic AD pathology, while S-BAG may capture pathological progression and cognitive decline in the symptomatic stage. A multimodal age-prediction model improves sensitivity to healthy age differences.

JOURNAL: Cancer research

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Clinical localization of primary tumors and sites of metastasis by PET is based on the enhanced cellular uptake of 2-deoxy-2-[18F]-fluoro-D-glucose (FDG). In prostate cancer, however, PET-FDG imaging has shown limited clinical applicability, suggesting that prostate cancer cells may utilize hexoses other than glucose, such as fructose, as the preferred energy source. Our previous studies suggested that prostate cancer cells overexpress fructose transporters, but not glucose transporters, compared with benign cells. Here, we focused on validating the functional expression of fructose transporters and determining whether fructose can modulate the biology of prostate cancer cellsin vitroandin vivo. Fructose transporters, Glut5 and Glut9, were significantly upregulated in clinical specimens of prostate cancer when compared with their benign counterparts. Fructose levels in the serum of patients with prostate cancer were significantly higher than healthy subjects. Functional expression of fructose transporters was confirmed in prostate cancer cell lines. A detailed kinetic characterization indicated that Glut5 represents the main functional contributor in mediating fructose transport in prostate cancer cells. Fructose stimulated proliferation and invasion of prostate cancer cellsin vitro. In addition, dietary fructose increased the growth of prostate cancer cell line-derived xenograft tumors and promoted prostate cancer cell proliferation in patient-derived xenografts. Gene set enrichment analysis confirmed that fructose stimulation enriched for proliferation-related pathways in prostate cancer cells. These results demonstrate that fructose promotes prostate cancer cell growth and aggressivenessin vitroandin vivoand may represent an alternative energy source for prostate cancer cells. SIGNIFICANCE: This study identifies increased expression of fructose transporters in prostate cancer and demonstrates a role for fructose as a key metabolic substrate supporting prostate cancer cells, revealing potential therapeutic targets and biomarkers.

TITLE: Optimisation of the Synthesis and Cell Labelling Conditions for [89Zr]Zr-oxine and [89Zr]Zr-DFO-NCS: a Direct In Vitro Comparison in Cell Types with Distinct Therapeutic Applications

AUTHORS: Ida Friberger, Emma Jussing, Jinming Han, Jeroen A C M Goos, Jonathan Siikanen, Helen Kaipe, Mélanie Lambert, Robert A Harris, Erik Samén, Mattias Carlsten, Staffan Holmin, Thuy A Tran

JOURNAL: Molecular imaging and biology

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Background: There is a need to better characterise cell-based therapies in preclinical models to help facilitate their translation to humans. Long-term high-resolution tracking of the cells in vivo is often impossible due to unreliable methods. Radiolabelling of cells has the advantage of being able to reveal cellular kinetics in vivo over time. This study aimed to optimise the synthesis of the radiotracers [89Zr]Zr-oxine (8-hydroxyquinoline) and [89Zr]Zr-DFO-NCS (p-SCN-Bn-Deferoxamine) and to perform a direct comparison of the cell labelling efficiency using these radiotracers.

Procedures: Several parameters, such as buffers, pH, labelling time and temperature, were investigated to optimise the synthesis of [89Zr]Zr-oxine and [89Zr]Zr-DFO-NCS in order to reach a radiochemical conversion (RCC) of >95 % without purification. Radio-instant thin-layer chromatography (iTLC) and radio high-performance liquid chromatography (radio-HPLC) were used to determine the RCC. Cells were labelled with [89Zr]Zr-oxine or [89Zr]Zr-DFO-NCS. The cellular retention of89Zr and the labelling impact was determined by analysing the cellular functions, such as viability, proliferation, phagocytotic ability and phenotypic immunostaining.

Results: The optimised synthesis of [89Zr]Zr-oxine and [89Zr]Zr-DFO-NCS resulted in straightforward protocols not requiring additional purification. [89Zr]Zr-oxine and [89Zr]Zr-DFO-NCS were synthesised with an average RCC of 98.4 % (n = 16) and 98.0 % (n = 13), respectively. Cell labelling efficiencies were 63.9 % (n = 35) and 70.2 % (n = 30), respectively.89Zr labelling neither significantly affected the cell viability (cell viability loss was in the range of 1-8 % compared to its corresponding non-labelled cells, P value > 0.05) nor the cells' proliferation rate. The phenotype of human decidual stromal cells (hDSC) and phagocytic function of rat bone-marrow-derived macrophages (rMac) was somewhat affected by radiolabelling.

Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that [89Zr]Zr-oxine and [89Zr]Zr-DFO-NCS are equally effective in cell labelling. However, [89Zr]Zr-oxine was superior to [89Zr]Zr-DFO-NCS with regard to long-term stability, cellular retention, minimal variation between cell types and cell labelling efficiency.

TITLE: Evaluation of 68Ga-DOTA-Ubiquicidin (29-41) for imaging Staphylococcus aureus (Staph A) infection and turpentine-induced inflammation in a preclinical setting

AUTHORS: Dilip Kumar Boddeti, Vijay Kumar

JOURNAL: World journal of nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Synthetic antimicrobial peptide fragment,99mTc-Ubiquicidin 29-41, is shown to be sensitive and also specific for imaging bacterial infections. We undertook this study to explore the advantage of using a positron emission agent,68Ga-DOTA-Ubiquicidin 29-41 (68Ga-DOTA-UBI), for detecting Staph-A infection in an animal model, and also evaluated its ability to distinguish a turpentine-induced sterile inflammation in an animal model. Pure Ga-68 was freshly eluted from a68Ge/68Ga generator (IGG-100). DOTA-UBI (50 μg) was ra diolabeled with pure Ga-68 (500MBq) by incubating the reaction mixture at pH 4.5 for 10 min, 95°C. Rats were infected with Staph-A at the hind leg joint of rats to form bacterial abscess. Sterile inflammation was induced in the right thigh muscle by injecting 200 μl of 100% turpentine oil. Rats were injected intravenously with 10-15 MBq of tracer, and images were acquired at different time intervals with Siemens (Biograph mCT) positron emission tomography computed tomography scanner. The early images at 6 min postinjection clearly indicated mild uptake of the agent corresponding to the infection site, which increased dramatically at 20, 30, and 60 min postinjection. The target to background ratio (T/B) increased significantly over the same time period of study (1.6, 4.2, and 6.1, respectively). There was a mild uptake of68Ga-DOTA-UBI at the site corresponding to sterile inflammation at 6 min postinjection, which was rapidly washed off as seen at 25 and 45 min images. The images indicated fast clearance of the agent from liver and soft tissues within 6 min. Control rats showed similar biodistribution of activity. The mild uptake of68Ga-DOTA-UBI at the corresponding Staph-A infection lesion and very fast kinetics of clearance from the blood pool and soft tissues suggested a very high clinical potential for this agent. The absence of uptake of the agent at sterile inflammation site suggests that the agent may be useful in distinguishing infection from inflammation.

TITLE: Fluoride transport in Arabidopsis thaliana plants is impaired in Fluoride EXporter (FEX) mutants

AUTHORS: S Lori Tausta, Kathryn Fontaine, Ansel T Hillmer, Scott A Strobel

JOURNAL: Plant molecular biology

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Fluoride is an environmental toxin prevalent in water, soil, and air. A fluoride transporter called Fluoride EXporter (FEX) has been discovered across all domains of life, including bacteria, single cell eukaryotes, and all plants, that is required for fluoride tolerance. How FEX functions to protect multicellular plants is unknown. In order to distinguish between different models, the dynamic movement of fluoride in wildtype (WT) and fex mutant plants was monitored using [18F]fluoride with positron emission tomography. Significant differences were observed in the washout behavior following initial fluoride uptake between plants with and without a functioning FEX. [18F]Fluoride traveled quickly up the floral stem and into terminal tissues in WT plants. In contrast, the fluoride did not move out of the lower regions of the stem in mutant plants resulting in clearance rates near zero. The roots were not the primary locus of FEX action, nor did FEX direct fluoride to a specific tissue. Fluoride efflux by WT plants was saturated at high fluoride concentrations resulting in a pattern like the fex mutant. The kinetics of fluoride movement suggested that FEX mediates a fluoride transport mechanism throughout the plant where each individual cell benefits from FEX expression.

JOURNAL: Diabetologia

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Aims/hypothesis: Postprandial hypoglycaemia (PPHG) is a frequent late complication of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) in people without diabetes. We aimed to examine the pathogenetic mechanisms of PPHG and its clinical consequences in people with a history of type 2 diabetes.

Methods: In this case-control study, 24 participants with type 2 diabetes treated with RYGB (14 women; median [IQR] age 53.5 [13.8] years, BMI 29.3 [6.3] kg/m2, HbA1c36.0 [6.2] mmol/mol [5.4% (0.6%)]) underwent a dual-tracer, frequently sampled, 300 min, 75 g OGTT for the diagnosis of PPHG (glucose nadir <3.0 mmol/l, or <3.3 mmol/l with symptoms). Plasma glucose, glucose tracers, insulin, C-peptide, glucagon-like peptide-1, gastric inhibitory polypeptide, glucagon, adrenaline (epinephrine), noradrenaline (norepinephrine), cortisol and NEFAs were measured. Mathematical models were implemented to estimate glucose metabolic fluxes and beta cell function. ECG recordings, cognitive testing and hypoglycaemia awareness assessments were repeated during the OGTT. Glycaemic levels and dietary habits were assessed under free-living conditions.

Results: PPHG occurred in 12 (50%) participants, mostly without symptoms, due to excessive tracer-derived glucose clearance (mean group difference ± SE in AUC0-180 min+261±72 ml min-1kg-1× min) driven by higher whole-body insulin sensitivity and early glucose-stimulated hyperinsulinaemia, the latter depending on lower insulin clearance and enhanced beta cell function, regardless of incretin hormones. PPHG participants also had defective counterregulatory hormone responses to hypoglycaemia, preventing a physiological increase in endogenous glucose production and the appearance of symptoms and signs of sympathetic cardiovascular activation and neuroglycopenia. PPHG was associated with more frequent and prolonged hypoglycaemia on 14 day continuous glucose monitoring and alterations in free-living dietary habits.

Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that post-bypass PPHG occurs frequently in individuals with a history of type 2 diabetes, often without warning symptoms, and expose its complex pathogenetic mechanisms, revealing potential therapeutic targets.

TITLE: High molecular weight hyaluronic acid-liposome delivery system for efficient transdermal treatment of acute and chronic skin photodamage

AUTHORS: Hui Xing, Xiangjun Pan, Yihan Hu, Yuhui Yang, Ziyi Zhao, Huanqi Peng, Jianjin Wang, Shanying Li, Yunfeng Hu, Guowei Li, Dong Ma

JOURNAL: Acta biomaterialia

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Photodamage is one of the most common causes of skin injury. High molecular weight hyaluronic acid (HHA) has shown immense potential in the treatment of skin photodamage by virtue of its anti-inflammatory, reparative, and antioxidative properties. However, due to its large molecular structure of HHA, HHA solution could only form a protective film on the skin surface in conventional application, failing to effectively penetrate the skin, which necessitates the development of new delivery strategies. Liposomes, with a structure similar to biological membranes, have garnered extensive attention as transdermal drug delivery carriers because of their advantages in permeability, dermal compatibility, and biosafety. Herein, we have developed a HHA-liposome transdermal system (HHL) by embedding HHA into the liposome structure using reverse evaporation, high-speed homogenization, and micro-jet techniques. The effective penetration and long-term residence of HHA in skin tissue were multidimensionally verified, and the kinetics of HHA in the skin were extensively studied. Moreover, it was demonstrated that HHL significantly strengthened the activity of human keratinocytes and effectively inhibits photo-induced cellular aging in vitro. Furthermore, a murine model of acute skin injury induced by laser ablation was established, where the transdermal system showed significant anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties, promoting skin proliferation and scar repair, thereby demonstrating immense potential in accelerating skin wound healing. Meanwhile, HHL significantly ameliorated skin barrier dysfunction caused by simulated sunlight exposure, inhibited skin erythema, inflammatory responses, and oxidative stress, and promoted collagen expression in a chronic photodamage skin model. Therefore, this transdermal delivery system with biocompatibility represents a promising new strategy for the non-invasive application of HHA in skin photodamage, revealing the significant potential for clinical translation and broad application prospects. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: The transdermal system utilizing hyaluronic acid-based liposomes enhances skin permeability and retains high molecular weight hyaluronic acid (HHL). In vitro experiments with human keratinocytes demonstrate significant skin repair effects of HHL and its effective inhibition of cellular aging. In an acute photodamage model, HHL exhibits stronger anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties, promoting skin proliferation and scar repair. In a chronic photodamage model, HHL significantly improves skin barrier dysfunction, reduces oxidative stress induced by simulated sunlight, and enhances collagen expression.

TITLE: Sodium Multivitamin Transporter-Targeted Fluorochrome Facilitates Enhanced Metabolic Evaluation of Tumors Through Coenzyme-R Dependent Intracellular Signaling Pathways

JOURNAL: Molecular imaging and biology

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Background: Intraoperative molecular imaging (IMI)-guided resections have been shown to improve oncologic outcomes for patients undergoing surgery for solid malignancies. The technology utilizes fluorescent tracers targeting cancer cells without the use of any ionizing radiation. However, currently available targeted IMI tracers are effective only for tumors with a highly specific receptor expression profile, and there is an unmet need for IMI tracers to label a broader range of tumor types. Here, we describe the development and testing of a novel tracer (CR)-S0456) targeted to the sodium multivitamin transporter (SMVT).

Methods: Preclinical models of fibrosarcoma (HT-1080), lung (A549), breast (4T1), and renal cancers (HEK-293 T) in vitro and in vivo were used for assessment of (CR)-S0456 specific tumor labeling via sodium-mediated SMVT uptake in dipotassium phosphate or choline chloride-containing media buffer. Additionally, pharmacologic inhibition of multiple intracellular coenzyme-R obligate signaling pathways, including holocarboxylase synthetase (sulconazole nitrate), PI3K/AKT/mTOR (omipalisib), and calmodulin-dependent phosphatase (calmidazolium), were investigated to assess (CR)-S0456 uptake kinetics. Human fibrosarcoma-bearing xenografts in athymic nude mice were used for tumor and metabolic-specific labeling. Novel NIR needle confocal laser endomicroscopic (nCLE) intratumoral sampling was performed to demonstrate single-cell specific labeling by CR-S0456.

Results: CR-S0456 localization in vitro correlated with highly proliferative cell lines (MTT) and doubling time (p < 0.05) with the highest microscopic fluorescence detected in aggressive human fibrosarcomas (HT-1080). Coenzyme-R-specific localization was demonstrated to be SMVT-specific after competitive inhibition of internal localization with excess administration of pantothenic acid. Inhibiting the activity of SMVT by affecting sodium ion hemostasis prevented the complete uptake of CR-S0456. In vivo validation demonstrated (CR)-S0456 localization to xenograft models with accurate identification of primary tumors as well as margin assessment down to 1 mm3tumor volume. Systemic treatment of xenograft-bearing mice with a dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor suppressed intratumoral cell signaling and (CR)-S0456 uptake via a reduction in SMVT expression. Novel analysis of in vivo intratumoral cytologic fluorescence using near-infrared confocal laser endomicroscopy demonstrated the absence of coenzyme-R-mediated NIR fluorescence but not fibroblast activation protein (FAP)-conjugated fluorochrome, indicating specific intracellular inhibition of coenzyme-R obligate pathways.

Conclusion: These findings suggest that a SMVT-targeted NIR contrast agent can be a suitable tracer for imaging a wide range of malignancies as well as evaluating metabolic response to systemic therapies, similar to PET imaging with immune checkpoint inhibitors.

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Background: Cerebral dopamine neurotrophic factor (CDNF) is an unconventional neurotrophic factor that protects dopamine neurons and improves motor function in animal models of Parkinson's disease (PD).

Objective: The primary objectives of this study were to assess the safety and tolerability of both CDNF and the drug delivery system (DDS) in patients with PD of moderate severity.

Methods: We assessed the safety and tolerability of monthly intraputamenal CDNF infusions in patients with PD using an investigational DDS, a bone-anchored transcutaneous port connected to four catheters. This phase 1 trial was divided into a placebo-controlled, double-blind, 6-month main study followed by an active-treatment 6-month extension. Eligible patients, aged 35 to 75 years, had moderate idiopathic PD for 5 to 15 years and Hoehn and Yahr score ≤ 3 (off state). Seventeen patients were randomized to placebo (n = 6), 0.4 mg CDNF (n = 6), or 1.2 mg CDNF (n = 5). The primary endpoints were safety and tolerability of CDNF and DDS and catheter implantation accuracy. Secondary endpoints were measures of PD symptoms, including Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, and DDS patency and port stability. Exploratory endpoints included motor symptom assessment (PKG, Global Kinetics Pty Ltd, Melbourne, Australia) and positron emission tomography using dopamine transporter radioligand [18F]FE-PE2I.

Results: Drug-related adverse events were mild to moderate with no difference between placebo and treatment groups. No severe adverse events were associated with the drug, and device delivery accuracy met specification. The severe adverse events recorded were associated with the infusion procedure and did not reoccur after procedural modification. There were no significant changes between placebo and CDNF treatment groups in secondary endpoints between baseline and the end of the main and extension studies.

Conclusions: Intraputamenally administered CDNF was safe and well tolerated, and possible signs of biological response to the drug were observed in individual patients. © 2023 The Authors.
