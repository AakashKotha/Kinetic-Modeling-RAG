TITLE: AI for PET image reconstruction

AUTHORS: Andrew J Reader, Bolin Pan

JOURNAL: The British journal of radiology

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Image reconstruction for positron emission tomography (PET) has been developed over many decades, with advances coming from improved modelling of the data statistics and improved modelling of the imaging physics. However, high noise and limited spatial resolution have remained issues in PET imaging, and state-of-the-art PET reconstruction has started to exploit other medical imaging modalities (such as MRI) to assist in noise reduction and enhancement of PET's spatial resolution. Nonetheless, there is an ongoing drive towards not only improving image quality, but also reducing the injected radiation dose and reducing scanning times. While the arrival of new PET scanners (such as total body PET) is helping, there is always a need to improve reconstructed image quality due to the time and count limited imaging conditions. Artificial intelligence (AI) methods are now at the frontier of research for PET image reconstruction. While AI can learn the imaging physics as well as the noise in the data (when given sufficient examples), one of the most common uses of AI arises from exploiting databases of high-quality reference examples, to provide advanced noise compensation and resolution recovery. There are three main AI reconstruction approaches: (i) direct data-driven AI methods which rely on supervised learning from reference data, (ii) iterative (unrolled) methods which combine our physics and statistical models with AI learning from data, and (iii) methods which exploit AI with our known models, but crucially can offer benefits even in the absence of any example training data whatsoever. This article reviews these methods, considering opportunities and challenges of AI for PET reconstruction.

TITLE: Deep learning-based PET image denoising and reconstruction: a review

AUTHORS: Fumio Hashimoto, Yuya Onishi, Kibo Ote, Hideaki Tashima, Andrew J Reader, Taiga Yamaya

JOURNAL: Radiological physics and technology

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
This review focuses on positron emission tomography (PET) imaging algorithms and traces the evolution of PET image reconstruction methods. First, we provide an overview of conventional PET image reconstruction methods from filtered backprojection through to recent iterative PET image reconstruction algorithms, and then review deep learning methods for PET data up to the latest innovations within three main categories. The first category involves post-processing methods for PET image denoising. The second category comprises direct image reconstruction methods that learn mappings from sinograms to the reconstructed images in an end-to-end manner. The third category comprises iterative reconstruction methods that combine conventional iterative image reconstruction with neural-network enhancement. We discuss future perspectives on PET imaging and deep learning technology.

TITLE: List-Mode PET Image Reconstruction Using Deep Image Prior

AUTHORS: Kibo Ote, Fumio Hashimoto, Yuya Onishi, Takashi Isobe, Yasuomi Ouchi

JOURNAL: IEEE transactions on medical imaging

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
List-mode positron emission tomography (PET) image reconstruction is an important tool for PET scanners with many lines-of-response and additional information such as time-of-flight and depth-of-interaction. Deep learning is one possible solution to enhance the quality of PET image reconstruction. However, the application of deep learning techniques to list-mode PET image reconstruction has not been progressed because list data is a sequence of bit codes and unsuitable for processing by convolutional neural networks (CNN). In this study, we propose a novel list-mode PET image reconstruction method using an unsupervised CNN called deep image prior (DIP) which is the first trial to integrate list-mode PET image reconstruction and CNN. The proposed list-mode DIP reconstruction (LM-DIPRecon) method alternatively iterates the regularized list-mode dynamic row action maximum likelihood algorithm (LM-DRAMA) and magnetic resonance imaging conditioned DIP (MR-DIP) using an alternating direction method of multipliers. We evaluated LM-DIPRecon using both simulation and clinical data, and it achieved sharper images and better tradeoff curves between contrast and noise than the LM-DRAMA, MR-DIP and sinogram-based DIPRecon methods. These results indicated that the LM-DIPRecon is useful for quantitative PET imaging with limited events while keeping accurate raw data information. In addition, as list data has finer temporal information than dynamic sinograms, list-mode deep image prior reconstruction is expected to be useful for 4D PET imaging and motion correction.

TITLE: PET image reconstruction with deep progressive learning

AUTHORS: Yang Lv, Chen Xi

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have recently achieved state-of-the-art results for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging problems. However direct learning from input image to target image is challenging if the gap is large between two images. Previous studies have shown that CNN can reduce image noise, but it can also degrade contrast recovery for small lesions. In this work, a deep progressive learning (DPL) method for PET image reconstruction is proposed to reduce background noise and improve image contrast. DPL bridges the gap between low quality image and high quality image through two learning steps. In the iterative reconstruction process, two pre-trained neural networks are introduced to control the image noise and contrast in turn. The feedback structure is adopted in the network design, which greatly reduces the parameters. The training data come from uEXPLORER, the world's first total-body PET scanner, in which the PET images show high contrast and very low image noise. We conducted extensive phantom and patient studies to test the algorithm for PET image quality improvement. The experimental results show that DPL is promising for reducing noise and improving contrast of PET images. Moreover, the proposed method has sufficient versatility to solve various imaging and image processing problems.

TITLE: PET Image Reconstruction With Kernel and Kernel Space Composite Regularizer

AUTHORS: Shiyao Guo, Yuxia Sheng, Li Chai, Jingxin Zhang

JOURNAL: IEEE transactions on medical imaging

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Led by the kernelized expectation maximization (KEM) method, the kernelized maximum-likelihood (ML) expectation maximization (EM) methods have recently gained prominence in PET image reconstruction, outperforming many previous state-of-the-art methods. But they are not immune to the problems of non-kernelized MLEM methods in potentially large reconstruction variance and high sensitivity to iteration numbers, and the difficulty in preserving image details and suppressing image variance simultaneously. To solve these problems, this paper derives, using the ideas of data manifold and graph regularization, a novel regularized KEM (RKEM) method with a kernel space composite regularizer for PET image reconstruction. The composite regularizer consists of a convex kernel space graph regularizer that smooths the kernel coefficients, a concave kernel space energy regularizer that enhances the coefficients' energy, and a composition constant that is analytically set to guarantee the convexity of composite regularizer. The composite regularizer renders easy use of PET-only image priors to overcome KEM's difficulty caused by the mismatch of MR prior and underlying PET images. Using this kernel space composite regularizer and the technique of optimization transfer, a globally convergent iterative algorithm is derived for RKEM reconstruction. Tests and comparisons on the simulated and in vivo data are presented to validate and evaluate the proposed algorithm, and demonstrate its better performance and advantages over KEM and other conventional methods.

TITLE: The Evolution of Image Reconstruction in PET: From Filtered Back-Projection to Artificial Intelligence

AUTHORS: Kuang Gong, Kyungsang Kim, Jianan Cui, Dufan Wu, Quanzheng Li

JOURNAL: PET clinics

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
PET can provide functional images revealing physiologic processes in vivo. Although PET has many applications, there are still some limitations that compromise its precision: the absorption of photons in the body causes signal attenuation; the dead-time limit of system components leads to the loss of the count rate; the scattered and random events received by the detector introduce additional noise; the characteristics of the detector limit the spatial resolution; and the low signal-to-noise ratio caused by the scan-time limit (eg, dynamic scans) and dose concern. The early PET reconstruction methods are analytical approaches based on an idealized mathematical model.

TITLE: Penalized-Likelihood PET Image Reconstruction Using Similarity-Driven Median Regularization

AUTHORS: Xue Ren, Ji Eun Jung, Wen Zhu, Soo-Jin Lee

JOURNAL: Tomography (Ann Arbor, Mich.)

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
In this paper, we present a new regularized image reconstruction method for positron emission tomography (PET), where an adaptive weighted median regularizer is used in the context of a penalized-likelihood framework. The motivation of our work is to overcome the limitation of the conventional median regularizer, which has proven useful for tomographic reconstruction but suffers from the negative effect of removing fine details in the underlying image when the edges occupy less than half of the window elements. The crux of our method is inspired by the well-known non-local means denoising approach, which exploits the measure of similarity between the image patches for weighted smoothing. However, our method is different from the non-local means denoising approach in that the similarity measure between the patches is used for the median weights rather than for the smoothing weights. As the median weights, in this case, are spatially variant, they provide adaptive median regularization achieving high-quality reconstructions. The experimental results indicate that our similarity-driven median regularization method not only improves the reconstruction accuracy, but also has great potential for super-resolution reconstruction for PET.

TITLE: Positronium Lifetime Image Reconstruction for TOF PET

AUTHORS: Jinyi Qi, Bangyan Huang

JOURNAL: IEEE transactions on medical imaging

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Positron emission tomography is widely used in clinical and preclinical applications. Positronium lifetime carries information about the tissue microenvironment where positrons are emitted, but such information has not been captured because of two technical challenges. One challenge is the low sensitivity in detecting triple coincidence events. This problem has been mitigated by the recent developments of PET scanners with long (1-2 m) axial field of view. The other challenge is the low spatial resolution of the positronium lifetime images formed by existing methods that is determined by the time-of-flight (TOF) resolution (200-500 ps) of existing PET scanners. This paper solves the second challenge by developing a new image reconstruction method to generate high-resolution positronium lifetime images using existing TOF PET. Simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed method can reconstruct positronium lifetime images at much better spatial resolution than the limit set by the TOF resolution of the PET scanner. The proposed method opens up the possibility of performing positronium lifetime imaging using existing TOF PET scanners. The lifetime information can be used to understand the tissue microenvironment in vivo which could facilitate the study of disease mechanism and selection of proper treatments.

TITLE: Image reconstruction using UNET-transformer network for fast and low-dose PET scans

AUTHORS: Sanaz Kaviani, Amirhossein Sanaat, Mersede Mokri, Claire Cohalan, Jean-Francois Carrier

JOURNAL: Computerized medical imaging and graphics : the official journal of the Computerized Medical Imaging Society

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Introduction: Low-dose and fast PET imaging (low-count PET) play a significant role in enhancing patient safety, healthcare efficiency, and patient comfort during medical imaging procedures. To achieve high-quality images with low-count PET scans, effective reconstruction models are crucial for denoising and enhancing image quality. The main goal of this paper is to develop an effective and accurate deep learning-based method for reconstructing low-count PET images, which is a challenging problem due to the limited amount of available data and the high level of noise in the acquired images. The proposed method aims to improve the quality of reconstructed PET images while preserving important features, such as edges and small details, by combining the strengths of UNET and Transformer networks.

Material and methods: The proposed TrUNET-MAPEM model integrates a residual UNET-transformer regularizer into the unrolled maximum a posteriori expectation maximization (MAPEM) algorithm for PET image reconstruction. A loss function based on a combination of structural similarity index (SSIM) and mean squared error (MSE) is utilized to evaluate the accuracy of the reconstructed images. The simulated dataset was generated using the Brainweb phantom, while the real patient dataset was acquired using a Siemens Biograph mMR PET scanner. We also implemented state-of-the-art methods for comparison purposes: OSEM, MAPOSEM, and supervised learning using 3D-UNET network. The reconstructed images are compared to ground truth images using metrics such as peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index (SSIM), and relative root mean square error (rRMSE) to quantitatively evaluate the accuracy of the reconstructed images.

Results: Our proposed TrUNET-MAPEM approach was evaluated using both simulated and real patient data. For the patient data, our model achieved an average PSNR of 33.72 dB, an average SSIM of 0.955, and an average rRMSE of 0.39. These results outperformed other methods which had average PSNRs of 36.89 dB, 34.12 dB, and 33.52 db, average SSIMs of 0.944, 0.947, and 0.951, and average rRMSEs of 0.59, 0.49, and 0.42. For the simulated data, our model achieved an average PSNR of 31.23 dB, an average SSIM of 0.95, and an average rRMSE of 0.55. These results also outperformed other state-of-the-art methods, such as OSEM, MAPOSEM, and 3DUNET-MAPEM. The model demonstrates the potential for clinical use by successfully reconstructing smooth images while preserving edges. The comparison with other methods demonstrates the superiority of our approach, as it outperforms all other methods for all three metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed TrUNET-MAPEM model presents a significant advancement in the field of low-count PET image reconstruction. The results demonstrate the potential for clinical use, as the model can produce images with reduced noise levels and better edge preservation compared to other reconstruction and post-processing algorithms. The proposed approach may have important clinical applications in the early detection and diagnosis of various diseases.

TITLE: MRI tractography-guided PET image reconstruction regularisation using connectome-based nonlocal means filtering

AUTHORS: Zhuopin Sun, Georgios Angelis, Steven Meikle, Fernando Calamante

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Positron emission tomography (PET) molecular biomarkers and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) derived information show associations and highly complementary information in a number of neurodegenerative conditions, including Alzheimer's disease. Diffusion MRI provides valuable information about the microstructure and structural connectivity (SC) of the brain which could guide and improve the PET image reconstruction when such associations exist. However, this potental has not been previously explored. In the present study, we propose a CONNectome-based non-local means one-atep late maximuma posteriori(CONN-NLM-OSLMAP) method, which allows diffusion MRI-derived connectivity information to be incorporated into the PET iterative image reconstruction process, thus regularising the estimated PET images. The proposed method was evaluated using a realistic tau-PET/MRI simulated phantom, demonstrating more effective noise reduction and lesion contrast improvement, as well as the lowest overall bias compared with both a median filter applied as an alternative regulariser and CONNectome-based non-local means as a post-reconstruction filter. By adding complementary SC information from diffusion MRI, the proposed regularisation method offers more useful and targeted denoising and regularisation, demonstrating the feasibility and effectiveness of integrating connectivity information into PET image reconstruction.

TITLE: Deep Kernel Representation for Image Reconstruction in PET

AUTHORS: Siqi Li, Guobao Wang

JOURNAL: IEEE transactions on medical imaging

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Image reconstruction for positron emission tomography (PET) is challenging because of the ill-conditioned tomographic problem and low counting statistics. Kernel methods address this challenge by using kernel representation to incorporate image prior information in the forward model of iterative PET image reconstruction. Existing kernel methods construct the kernels commonly using an empirical process, which may lead to unsatisfactory performance. In this paper, we describe the equivalence between the kernel representation and a trainable neural network model. A deep kernel method is then proposed by exploiting a deep neural network to enable automated learning of an improved kernel model and is directly applicable to single subjects in dynamic PET. The training process utilizes available image prior data to form a set of robust kernels in an optimized way rather than empirically. The results from computer simulations and a real patient dataset demonstrate that the proposed deep kernel method can outperform the existing kernel method and neural network method for dynamic PET image reconstruction.

TITLE: Dynamic PET image reconstruction utilizing intrinsic data-driven HYPR4D denoising kernel

AUTHORS: Ju-Chieh Kevin Cheng, Connor Bevington, Arman Rahmim, Ivan Klyuzhin, Julian Matthews, Ronald Boellaard, Vesna Sossi

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Reconstructed PET images are typically noisy, especially in dynamic imaging where the acquired data are divided into several short temporal frames. High noise in the reconstructed images translates to poor precision/reproducibility of image features. One important role of "denoising" is therefore to improve the precision of image features. However, typical denoising methods achieve noise reduction at the expense of accuracy. In this work, we present a novel four-dimensional (4D) denoised image reconstruction framework, which we validate using 4D simulations, experimental phantom, and clinical patient data, to achieve 4D noise reduction while preserving spatiotemporal patterns/minimizing error introduced by denoising.

Methods: Our proposed 4D denoising operator/kernel is based on HighlY constrained backPRojection (HYPR), which is applied either after each update of OSEM reconstruction of dynamic 4D PET data or within the recently proposed kernelized reconstruction framework inspired by kernel methods in machine learning. Our HYPR4D kernel makes use of the spatiotemporal high frequency features extracted from a 4D composite, generated within the reconstruction, to preserve the spatiotemporal patterns and constrain the 4D noise increment of the image estimate.

Results: Results from simulations, experimental phantom, and patient data showed that the HYPR4D kernel with our proposed 4D composite outperformed other denoising methods, such as the standard OSEM with spatial filter, OSEM with 4D filter, and HYPR kernel method with the conventional 3D composite in conjunction with recently proposed High Temporal Resolution kernel (HYPRC3D-HTR), in terms of 4D noise reduction while preserving the spatiotemporal patterns or 4D resolution within the 4D image estimate. Consequently, the error in outcome measures obtained from the HYPR4D method was less dependent on the region size, contrast, and uniformity/functional patterns within the target structures compared to the other methods. For outcome measures that depend on spatiotemporal tracer uptake patterns such as the nondisplaceable Binding Potential (BPND), the root mean squared error in regional mean of voxel BPNDvalues was reduced from ~8% (OSEM with spatial or 4D filter) to ~3% using HYPRC3D-HTR and was further reduced to ~2% using our proposed HYPR4D method for relatively small target structures (~10 mm in diameter). At the voxel level, HYPR4D produced two to four times lower mean absolute error in BPNDrelative to HYPRC3D-HTR.

Conclusion: As compared to conventional methods, our proposed HYPR4D method can produce more robust and accurate image features without requiring any prior information.

TITLE: Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning for Advancing PET Image Reconstruction: State-of-the-Art and Future Directions

AUTHORS: Dirk Hellwig, Nils Constantin Hellwig, Steven Boehner, Timo Fuchs, Regina Fischer, Daniel Schmidt

JOURNAL: Nuklearmedizin. Nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Positron emission tomography (PET) is vital for diagnosing diseases and monitoring treatments. Conventional image reconstruction (IR) techniques like filtered backprojection and iterative algorithms are powerful but face limitations. PET IR can be seen as an image-to-image translation. Artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning (DL) using multilayer neural networks enable a new approach to this computer vision task. This review aims to provide mutual understanding for nuclear medicine professionals and AI researchers. We outline fundamentals of PET imaging as well as state-of-the-art in AI-based PET IR with its typical algorithms and DL architectures. Advances improve resolution and contrast recovery, reduce noise, and remove artifacts via inferred attenuation and scatter correction, sinogram inpainting, denoising, and super-resolution refinement. Kernel-priors support list-mode reconstruction, motion correction, and parametric imaging. Hybrid approaches combine AI with conventional IR. Challenges of AI-assisted PET IR include availability of training data, cross-scanner compatibility, and the risk of hallucinated lesions. The need for rigorous evaluations, including quantitative phantom validation and visual comparison of diagnostic accuracy against conventional IR, is highlighted along with regulatory issues. First approved AI-based applications are clinically available, and its impact is foreseeable. Emerging trends, such as the integration of multimodal imaging and the use of data from previous imaging visits, highlight future potentials. Continued collaborative research promises significant improvements in image quality, quantitative accuracy, and diagnostic performance, ultimately leading to the integration of AI-based IR into routine PET imaging protocols.

TITLE: MRI-aided kernel PET image reconstruction method based on texture features

AUTHORS: Dongfang Gao, Xu Zhang, Chao Zhou, Wei Fan, Tianyi Zeng, Qian Yang, Jianmin Yuan, Qiang He, Dong Liang, Xin Liu, Yongfeng Yang, Hairong Zheng, Zhanli Hu

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
We investigate the reconstruction of low-count positron emission tomography (PET) projection, which is an important, but challenging, task. Using the texture feature extraction method of radiomics, i.e. the gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), texture features can be extracted from magnetic resonance imaging images with high-spatial resolution. In this work, we propose a kernel reconstruction method combining autocorrelation texture features derived from the GLCM. The new kernel function includes the correlations of both the intensity and texture features from the prior image. By regarding the GLCM as a discrete approximation of a probability density function, the asymptotically gray-level-invariant autocorrelation texture feature is generated, which can maintain the accuracy of texture features extracted from small image regions by reducing the number of quantized image gray levels. A computer simulation shows that the proposed method can effectively reduce the noise in the reconstructed image compared to the maximum likelihood expectation maximum method and improve the image quality and tumor region accuracy compared to the original kernel method for low-count PET reconstruction. A simulation study on clinical patient images also shows that the proposed method can improve the whole image quality and that the reconstruction of a high-uptake lesion is more accurate than that achieved by the original kernel method.

TITLE: Approximating anatomically-guided PET reconstruction in image space using a convolutional neural network

AUTHORS: Georg Schramm, David Rigie, Thomas Vahle, Ahmadreza Rezaei, Koen Van Laere, Timothy Shepherd, Johan Nuyts, Fernando Boada

JOURNAL: NeuroImage

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
In the last two decades, it has been shown that anatomically-guided PET reconstruction can lead to improved bias-noise characteristics in brain PET imaging. However, despite promising results in simulations and first studies, anatomically-guided PET reconstructions are not yet available for use in routine clinical because of several reasons. In light of this, we investigate whether the improvements of anatomically-guided PET reconstruction methods can be achieved entirely in the image domain with a convolutional neural network (CNN). An entirely image-based CNN post-reconstruction approach has the advantage that no access to PET raw data is needed and, moreover, that the prediction times of trained CNNs are extremely fast on state of the art GPUs which will substantially facilitate the evaluation, fine-tuning and application of anatomically-guided PET reconstruction in real-world clinical settings. In this work, we demonstrate that anatomically-guided PET reconstruction using the asymmetric Bowsher prior can be well-approximated by a purely shift-invariant convolutional neural network in image space allowing the generation of anatomically-guided PET images in almost real-time. We show that by applying dedicated data augmentation techniques in the training phase, in which 16 [18F]FDG and 10 [18F]PE2I data sets were used, lead to a CNN that is robust against the used PET tracer, the noise level of the input PET images and the input MRI contrast. A detailed analysis of our CNN in 36 [18F]FDG, 18 [18F]PE2I, and 7 [18F]FET test data sets demonstrates that the image quality of our trained CNN is very close to the one of the target reconstructions in terms of regional mean recovery and regional structural similarity.

TITLE: PET image reconstruction using weighted nuclear norm maximization and deep learning prior

AUTHORS: Xiaodong Kuang, Bingxuan Li, Tianling Lyu, Yitian Xue, Hailiang Huang, Qingguo Xie, Wentao Zhu

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
The ill-posed Positron emission tomography (PET) reconstruction problem usually results in limited resolution and significant noise. Recently, deep neural networks have been incorporated into PET iterative reconstruction framework to improve the image quality. In this paper, we propose a new neural network-based iterative reconstruction method by using weighted nuclear norm (WNN) maximization, which aims to recover the image details in the reconstruction process. The novelty of our method is the application of WNN maximization rather than WNN minimization in PET image reconstruction. Meanwhile, a neural network is used to control the noise originated from WNN maximization. Our method is evaluated on simulated and clinical datasets. The simulation results show that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art neural network-based iterative methods by achieving the best contrast/noise tradeoff with a remarkable contrast improvement on the lesion contrast recovery. The study on clinical datasets also demonstrates that our method can recover lesions of different sizes while suppressing noise in various low-dose PET image reconstruction tasks.

TITLE: Penalized-Likelihood PET Image Reconstruction Using 3D Structural Convolutional Sparse Coding

AUTHORS: Nuobei Xie, Kuang Gong, Ning Guo, Zhixing Qin, Zhifang Wu, Huafeng Liu, Quanzheng Li

JOURNAL: IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Positron emission tomography (PET) is widely used for clinical diagnosis. As PET suffers from low resolution and high noise, numerous efforts try to incorporate anatomical priors into PET image reconstruction, especially with the development of hybrid PET/CT and PET/MRI systems. In this work, we proposed a cube-based 3D structural convolutional sparse coding (CSC) concept for penalized-likelihood PET image reconstruction, named 3D PET-CSC. The proposed 3D PET-CSC takes advantage of the convolutional operation and manages to incorporate anatomical priors without the need of registration or supervised training. As 3D PET-CSC codes the whole 3D PET image, instead of patches, it alleviates the staircase artifacts commonly presented in traditional patch-based sparse coding methods. Compared with traditional coding methods in Fourier domain, the proposed method extends the 3D CSC to a straightforward approach based on the pursuit of localized cubes. Moreover, we developed the residual-image and order-subset mechanisms to further reduce the computational cost and accelerate the convergence for the proposed 3D PET-CSC method. Experiments based on computer simulations and clinical datasets demonstrate the superiority of 3D PET-CSC compared with other reference methods.

ABSTRACT:
Presented and discussed are challenges that had to be addressed for generation of the first long axial field-of-view (LAFOV) PET static and dynamic images. A brief comparison between the two main "schools of thought" behind the development of the only two implemented scanners at the time of writing is given. Although both aim to achieve the best possible quantitative static PET images and high-quality dynamic time-activity curves, their methods are different and reflect their history and future. As the benefits of the LAFOV are appealing to many, some popular strategies for cost management are briefly presented.

TITLE: Low-count PET image reconstruction based on truncated inverse radon layer and U-shaped network

AUTHORS: Jianbo Ye, Zhonghua Kuang, Yongfeng Yang, Ke Cui, Xiangyu Li

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Objective.Positron emission tomography (PET) is a functional imaging widely used in various applications such as tumour detection. PET image reconstruction is an ill-posed inverse problem, and the model-based iterative reconstruction methods commonly used in clinical practice have disadvantages such as long time consumption and low signal-to-noise ratio, especially at low doses.Approach.In this study, we propose a deep learning-based reconstruction method that is capable of reconstructing images directly from low-count sinograms. Our network consists of two parts, a truncated inverse radon layer for implementing domain transform and a U-shaped network for image enhancement.Main result.We validated our method on both simulation data and real data. Compared to ordered subset expectation maximization with a post-Guassian filter, the structural similarity can be improved from 0.9357 to 0.9613 and the peak signal-to-noise ratio can be improved by 5 dB.Significance.The proposed method can directly convert low-count sinograms into PET images, while obtaining improved image quality and having less time consumption than iterative reconstruction algorithms and the state-of-the-art convolutional neural network.

TITLE: An iterative reconstruction algorithm for unsupervised PET image

AUTHORS: Siqi Wang, Bing Liu, Furan Xie, Li Chai

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Objective.In recent years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown great potential in positron emission tomography (PET) image reconstruction. However, most of them rely on many low-quality and high-quality reference PET image pairs for training, which are not always feasible in clinical practice. On the other hand, many works improve the quality of PET image reconstruction by adding explicit regularization or optimizing the network structure, which may lead to complex optimization problems.Approach.In this paper, we develop a novel iterative reconstruction algorithm by integrating the deep image prior (DIP) framework, which only needs the prior information (e.g. MRI) and sinogram data of patients. To be specific, we construct the objective function as a constrained optimization problem and utilize the existing PET image reconstruction packages to streamline calculations. Moreover, to further improve both the reconstruction quality and speed, we introduce the Nesterov's acceleration part and the restart mechanism in each iteration.Main results.2D experiments on PET data sets based on computer simulations and real patients demonstrate that our proposed algorithm can outperform existing MLEM-GF, KEM and DIPRecon methods.Significance.Unlike traditional CNN methods, the proposed algorithm does not rely on large data sets, but only leverages inter-patient information. Furthermore, we enhance reconstruction performance by optimizing the iterative algorithm. Notably, the proposed method does not require much modification of the basic algorithm, allowing for easy integration into standard implementations.

TITLE: PET-enabled dual-energy CT: image reconstruction and a proof-of-concept computer simulation study

AUTHORS: Guobao Wang

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Standard dual-energy computed tomography (CT) uses two different x-ray energies to obtain energy-dependent tissue attenuation information to allow quantitative material decomposition. The combined use of dual-energy CT and positron emission tomography (PET) may provide a more comprehensive characterization of disease states in cancer and other diseases. However, the integration of dual-energy CT with PET is not trivial, either requiring costly hardware upgrades or increasing radiation exposure. This paper proposes a different dual-energy CT imaging method that is enabled by PET. Instead of using a second x-ray CT scan with a different energy, this method exploits time-of-flight PET image reconstruction via the maximum likelihood attenuation and activity (MLAA) algorithm to obtain a 511 keV gamma-ray attenuation image from PET emission data. The high-energy gamma-ray attenuation image is then combined with the low-energy x-ray CT of PET/CT to provide a pair of dual-energy CT images. A major challenge with the standard MLAA reconstruction is the high noise present in the reconstructed 511 keV attenuation map, which would not compromise the PET activity reconstruction too much but may significantly affect the performance of the gamma-ray attenuation image for material decomposition. To overcome the problem, we further propose a kernel MLAA algorithm to exploit the prior information from the available x-ray CT image. We conducted a computer simulation to test the concept and algorithm for the task of material decomposition. The simulation results demonstrate that this PET-enabled dual-energy CT method is promising for quantitative material decomposition. The proposed method can be readily implemented on time-of-flight PET/CT scanners to enable simultaneous PET and dual-energy CT imaging.

TITLE: Deep learning-based image reconstruction for TOF PET with DIRECT data partitioning format

AUTHORS: Tao Feng, Shulin Yao, Chen Xi, Yizhang Zhao, Ruimin Wang, Shina Wu, Can Li, Baixuan Xu

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Conventional positron emission tomography (PET) image reconstruction is achieved by the statistical iterative method. Deep learning provides another opportunity for speeding up the image reconstruction process. However, conventional deep learning-based image reconstruction requires a fully connected network for learning the Radon transform. The use of fully connected networks greatly complicated the network and increased hardware cost. In this study, we proposed a novel deep learning-based image reconstruction method by utilizing the DIRECT data partitioning method. The U-net structure with only convolutional layers was used in our approach. Patch-based model training and testing were used to achieve 3D reconstructions within current hardware limitations. Time-of-flight (TOF)-histoimages were first generated from the listmode data to replace conventional sinograms. Different projection angles were used as different channels in the input. A total of 15 patient data were used in this study. For each patient, the dynamic whole-body scanning protocol was used to expand the training dataset and a total of 372 separate scans were included. The leave-one-patient-out validation method was used. Two separate studies were carried out. In the first study, the measured TOF-histoimages were directly used for model training and testing, to study the performance of the method in real-world applications. In the second study, TOF-histoimages were simulated from already reconstructed images to exclude the scatters, randoms, attenuation-activity mismatch effects. This study was used to evaluate the optimal performance when all other corrections are ideal. Volumes of interests were placed in the liver and lesion region to study image noise and lesion quantitations. The reconstructed images using the proposed deep learning method showed similar image quality when compared with the conventional expectation-maximization approach. A minimal difference was observed when the simulated TOF-histoimages were used as model input and testing, suggesting the deep learning model can indeed learn the reconstruction process. Some quantitative difference was observed when the measured TOF-histoimages were used. The two studies suggested that the major difference is caused by inaccurate corrections performed by the network itself, which indicated that physics-based corrections are still required for better quantitative performance. In conclusion, we have proposed a novel deep learning-based image reconstruction method for TOF PET. With the help of the DIRECT data partitioning method, no fully connected layers were used and 3D image reconstruction can be directly achieved within the limits of the current hardware.

ABSTRACT:
The rapid expansion of machine learning is offering a new wave of opportunities for nuclear medicine. This paper reviews applications of machine learning for the study of attenuation correction (AC) and low-count image reconstruction in quantitative positron emission tomography (PET). Specifically, we present the developments of machine learning methodology, ranging from random forest and dictionary learning to the latest convolutional neural network-based architectures. For application in PET attenuation correction, two general strategies are reviewed: 1) generating synthetic CT from MR or non-AC PET for the purposes of PET AC, and 2) direct conversion from non-AC PET to AC PET. For low-count PET reconstruction, recent deep learning-based studies and the potential advantages over conventional machine learning-based methods are presented and discussed. In each application, the proposed methods, study designs and performance of published studies are listed and compared with a brief discussion. Finally, the overall contributions and remaining challenges are summarized.

TITLE: Anatomically aided PET image reconstruction using deep neural networks

AUTHORS: Zhaoheng Xie, Tiantian Li, Xuezhu Zhang, Wenyuan Qi, Evren Asma, Jinyi Qi

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: The developments of PET/CT and PET/MR scanners provide opportunities for improving PET image quality by using anatomical information. In this paper, we propose a novel co-learning three-dimensional (3D) convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract modality-specific features from PET/CT image pairs and integrate complementary features into an iterative reconstruction framework to improve PET image reconstruction.

Methods: We used a pretrained deep neural network to represent PET images. The network was trained using low-count PET and CT image pairs as inputs and high-count PET images as labels. This network was then incorporated into a constrained maximum likelihood framework to regularize PET image reconstruction. Two different network structures were investigated for the integration of anatomical information from CT images. One was a multichannel CNN, which treated PET and CT volumes as separate channels of the input. The other one was multibranch CNN, which implemented separate encoders for PET and CT images to extract latent features and fed the combined latent features into a decoder. Using computer-based Monte Carlo simulations and two real patient datasets, the proposed method has been compared with existing methods, including the maximum likelihood expectation maximization (MLEM) reconstruction, a kernel-based reconstruction and a CNN-based deep penalty method with and without anatomical guidance.

Results: Reconstructed images showed that the proposed constrained ML reconstruction approach produced higher quality images than the competing methods. The tumors in the lung region have higher contrast in the proposed constrained ML reconstruction than in the CNN-based deep penalty reconstruction. The image quality was further improved by incorporating the anatomical information. Moreover, the liver standard deviation was lower in the proposed approach than all the competing methods at a matched lesion contrast.

Conclusions: The supervised co-learning strategy can improve the performance of constrained maximum likelihood reconstruction. Compared with existing techniques, the proposed method produced a better lesion contrast versus background standard deviation trade-off curve, which can potentially improve lesion detection.

TITLE: Improving 90Y PET Scan Image Quality Through Optimized Reconstruction Algorithms

AUTHORS: Pei Ing Ngam, Eelin Tan, Gabriel Lim, Sean Xuexian Yan

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear medicine technology

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
This study aimed to improve the quality of90Y PET imaging by optimizing the reconstruction algorithm.Methods:We recruited 10 patients with neuroendocrine tumor metastatic to the liver or primary hepatocellular carcinoma who were qualified for90Y-labeled selective internal radiation therapy or peptide receptor radionuclide therapy. They underwent posttherapeutic PET/CT imaging using 3 different reconstruction parameters: VUE Point HD with a 6.4-mm filter cutoff, 24 subsets, and 2 iterations (algorithm A); VUE Point FX with a 6.0-mm filter cutoff, 18 subsets, and 3 iterations using time of flight (algorithm B); and VUE Point HD (LKYG) with a 5-mm filter cutoff, 32 subsets, and 1 iteration (algorithm C). The reconstructed PET/CT images were assessed by 10 nuclear medicine physicians using 4-point semiqualitative scoring criteria. APvalue of less than 0.05 was considered significant.Results:The median quality assessment scores for algorithm C were consistently scored the highest, with algorithms A, B, and C, scoring 3, 2, and 4, respectively. The90Y PET scans using algorithm C were deemed diagnostic 91% of the time. There was a statistically significant difference in quality assessment scores among the algorithms by the Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test ([Formula: see text] = 86.5,P< 0.001), with a mean rank quality score of 130.03 for algorithm A, 109.76 for algorithm B, and 211.71 for algorithm C. Subgroup analysis for quality assessment scoring of post-peptide receptor radionuclide therapy imaging alone showed a statistically significant difference between different scanning algorithms ([Formula: see text] = 35.35,P< 0.001), with mean rank quality scores of 45.85 for algorithm A, 50.05 for algorithm B, and 85.6 for algorithm C. Similar results were observed for quality assessment scoring of imaging after selective internal radiation therapy ([Formula: see text] = 79.90,P< 0.001), with mean ranks of 82.33 for algorithm A, 55.79 for algorithm B, and 133.38 for algorithm C.Conclusion:The new LKYG algorithm that was featured by decreasing the number of iterations, decreasing the cutoff of the filter thickness, and increasing the number of subsets successfully improved image quality.

TITLE: Anatomically Guided PET Image Reconstruction Using Conditional Weakly-Supervised Multi-Task Learning Integrating Self-Attention

AUTHORS: Bao Yang, Kuang Gong, Huafeng Liu, Quanzheng Li, Wentao Zhu

JOURNAL: IEEE transactions on medical imaging

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
To address the lack of high-quality training labels in positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, weakly-supervised reconstruction methods that generate network-based mappings between prior images and noisy targets have been developed. However, the learned model has an intrinsic variance proportional to the average variance of the target image. To suppress noise and improve the accuracy and generalizability of the learned model, we propose a conditional weakly-supervised multi-task learning (MTL) strategy, in which an auxiliary task is introduced serving as an anatomical regularizer for the PET reconstruction main task. In the proposed MTL approach, we devise a novel multi-channel self-attention (MCSA) module that helps learn an optimal combination of shared and task-specific features by capturing both local and global channel-spatial dependencies. The proposed reconstruction method was evaluated on NEMA phantom PET datasets acquired at different positions in a PET/CT scanner and 26 clinical whole-body PET datasets. The phantom results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art learning-free and weakly-supervised approaches obtaining the best noise/contrast tradeoff with a significant noise reduction of approximately 50.0% relative to the maximum likelihood (ML) reconstruction. The patient study results demonstrate that our method achieves the largest noise reductions of 67.3% and 35.5% in the liver and lung, respectively, as well as consistently small biases in 8 tumors with various volumes and intensities. In addition, network visualization reveals that adding the auxiliary task introduces more anatomical information into PET reconstruction than adding only the anatomical loss, and the developed MCSA can abstract features and retain PET image details.

ABSTRACT:
This work demonstrates how computational and physical modelling of the positron emission tomography (PET) image acquisition process for a state-of-the-art integrated PET and magnetic resonance imaging (PET-MR) system can produce images comparable to the manufacturer. The GE SIGNA PET/MR scanner is manufactured by General Electric and has time-of-flight (TOF) capabilities of about 390 ps. All software development took place in the Software for Tomographic Image Reconstruction (STIR: http://stir.sf.net) library, which is a widely used open source software to reconstruct data as exported from emission tomography scanners. The new software developments will be integrated into STIR, providing the opportunity for researchers worldwide to establish and expand their image reconstruction methods. Furthermore, this work is of particular significance as it provides the first validation of TOF PET image reconstruction for real scanner datasets using the STIR library. This paper presents the methodology, analysis, and critical issues encountered in implementing an independent reconstruction software package. Acquired PET data were processed via several appropriate algorithms which are necessary to produce an accurate and precise quantitative image. This included mathematical, physical and anatomical modelling of the patient and simulation of various aspects of the acquisition. These included modelling of random coincidences using 'singles' rates per crystals, detector efficiencies and geometric effects. Attenuation effects were calculated by using the STIR's attenuation correction model. Modelling all these effects within the system matrix allowed the reconstruction of PET images which demonstrates the metabolic uptake of the administered radiopharmaceutical. These implementations were validated using measured phantom and clinical datasets. The developments are tested using the ordered subset expectation maximisation (OSEM) and the more recently proposed kernelised expectation maximisation (KEM) algorithm which incorporates anatomical information from MR images into PET reconstruction.

TITLE: A Lightweight Low-dose PET Image Super-resolution Reconstruction Method based on Convolutional Neural Network

AUTHORS: Kun Liu, Haiyun Yu, Mingyang Zhang, Lei Zhao, Xianghui Wang, Shuang Liu, Haoran Li, Kun Yang

JOURNAL: Current medical imaging

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Background: PET imaging is one of the most widely used neurological disease screening and diagnosis techniques.

Aims: Since PET involves the radiation and tolerance of different people, the improvement that has always been focused on is to cut down radiation, in the meantime, ensuring that the generated images with low-dose tracer and generated images with standard-dose tracer have the same details of images.

Methods: We propose a lightweight low-dose PET super-resolution network (SRPET-Net) based on a convolutional neural network. In this research, We propose a method for accurately recovering highresolution (HR) PET images from low-resolution (LR) PET images. The network learns the details and structure of the image between low-dose PET images and standard-dose PET images and, afterward, reconstructs the PET image by the trained network model.

Results: The experiments indicate that the SRPET-Net can achieve a superior peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index measurement (SSIM) values. Moreover, our method has less memory consumption and lower computational cost.

Conclusion: In our follow-up work, the technology can be applied to medical imaging in many different directions.

TITLE: Deep Learning Based Joint PET Image Reconstruction and Motion Estimation

AUTHORS: Tiantian Li, Mengxi Zhang, Wenyuan Qi, Evren Asma, Jinyi Qi

JOURNAL: IEEE transactions on medical imaging

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Respiratory motion is one of the main sources of motion artifacts in positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. The emission image and patient motion can be estimated simultaneously from respiratory gated data through a joint estimation framework. However, conventional motion estimation methods based on registration of a pair of images are sensitive to noise. The goal of this study is to develop a robust joint estimation method that incorporates a deep learning (DL)-based image registration approach for motion estimation. We propose a joint estimation framework by incorporating a learned image registration network into a regularized PET image reconstruction. The joint estimation was formulated as a constrained optimization problem with moving gated images related to a fixed image via the deep neural network. The constrained optimization problem is solved by the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm. The effectiveness of the algorithm was demonstrated using simulated and real data. We compared the proposed DL-ADMM joint estimation algorithm with a monotonic iterative joint estimation. Motion compensated reconstructions using pre-calculated deformation fields by DL-based (DL-MC recon) and iterative (iterative-MC recon) image registration were also included for comparison. Our simulation study shows that the proposed DL-ADMM joint estimation method reduces bias compared to the ungated image without increasing noise and outperforms the competing methods. In the real data study, our proposed method also generated higher lesion contrast and sharper liver boundaries compared to the ungated image and had lower noise than the reference gated image.

TITLE: Efficient image reconstruction for a small animal PET system with dual-layer-offset detector design

AUTHORS: Li Cheng, Zhenlei Lyu, Hui Liu, Jing Wu, Chao Jia, Yuanguang Wu, Yingcai Ji, Nianming Jiang, Tianyu Ma, Yaqiang Liu

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Background: A compact PET/SPECT/CT system Inliview-3000B has been developed to provide multi-modality information on small animals for biomedical research. Its PET subsystem employed a dual-layer-offset detector design for depth-of-interaction capability and higher detection efficiency, but the irregular design caused some difficulties in calculating the normalization factors and the sensitivity map. Besides, the relatively larger (2 mm) crystal cross-section size also posed a challenge to high-resolution image reconstruction.

Purpose: We present an efficient image reconstruction method to achieve high imaging performance for the PET subsystem of Inliview-3000B.

Methods: List mode reconstruction with efficient system modeling was used for the PET imaging. We adopt an on-the-fly multi-ray tracing method with random crystal sampling to model the solid angle, crystal penetration and object attenuation effect, and modify the system response model during each iteration to improve the reconstruction performance and computational efficiency. We estimate crystal efficiency with a novel iterative approach that combines measured cylinder phantom data with simulated line-of-response (LOR)-based factors for normalization correction before reconstruction. Since it is necessary to calculate normalization factors and the sensitivity map, we stack the two crystal layers together and extend the conventional data organization method here to index all useful LORs. Simulations and experiments were performed to demonstrate the feasibility and advantage of the proposed method.

Results: Simulation results showed that the iterative algorithm for crystal efficiency estimation could achieve good accuracy. NEMA image quality phantom studies have demonstrated the superiority of random sampling, which is able to achieve good imaging performance with much less computation than traditional uniform sampling. In the spatial resolution evaluation based on the mini-Derenzo phantom, 1.1 mm hot rods could be identified with the proposed reconstruction method. Reconstruction of double mice and a rat showed good spatial resolution and a high signal-to-noise ratio, and organs with higher uptake could be recognized well.

Conclusion: The results validated the superiority of introducing randomness into reconstruction, and demonstrated its reliability for high-performance imaging. The Inliview-3000B PET subsystem with the proposed image reconstruction can provide rich and detailed information on small animals for preclinical research.

ABSTRACT:
In this paper we introduce a semi-analytic algorithm for 3-dimensional image reconstruction for positron emission tomography (PET). The method consists of the back-projection of the acquired data into the most likely image voxel according to time-of-flight (TOF) information, followed by the filtering step in the image space using an iterative optimization algorithm with a total variation (TV) regularization. TV regularization in image space is more computationally efficient than usual iterative optimization methods for PET reconstruction with full system matrix that use TV regularization. The efficiency comes from the one-time TOF back-projection step that might also be described as a reformatting of the acquired data. An important aspect of our work concerns the evaluation of the filter operator of the linear transform mapping an original radioactive tracer distribution into the TOF back-projected image. We obtain concise, closed-form analytical formula for the filter operator. The proposed method is validated with the Monte Carlo simulations of the NEMA IEC phantom using a one-layer, 50 cm-long cylindrical device called Jagiellonian PET scanner. The results show a better image quality compared with the reference TOF maximum likelihood expectation maximization algorithm.

TITLE: Virtual cylindrical PET for efficient DOI image reconstruction with sub-millimetre resolution

AUTHORS: Francisco E Enríquez-Mier-Y-Terán, Andre Z Kyme, Georgios Angelis, Steven R Meikle

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Objective.Image reconstruction in high resolution, narrow bore PET scanners with depth of interaction (DOI) capability presents a substantial computational challenge due to the very high sampling in detector and image space. The aim of this study is to evaluate the use of a virtual cylinder in reducing the number of lines of response (LOR) for DOI-based reconstruction in high resolution PET systems while maintaining uniform sub-millimetre spatial resolution.Approach.Virtual geometry was investigated using the awake animal mousePET as a high resolution test case. Using GEANT4 Application for Tomographic Emission (GATE), we simulated the physical scanner and three virtual cylinder implementations with detector size 0.74 mm, 0.47 mm and 0.36 mm (vPET1, vPET2 and vPET3, respectively). The virtual cylinder condenses physical LORs stemming from various crystal pairs and DOI combinations, and which intersect a single virtual detector pair, into a single virtual LOR. Quantitative comparisons of the point spread function (PSF) at various positions within the field of view (FOV) were compared for reconstructions based on the vPET implementations and the physical scanner. We also assessed the impact of the anisotropic PSFs by reconstructing images of a micro Derenzo phantom.Main results.All virtual cylinder implementations achieved LOR data compression of at least 50% for DOI PET reconstruction. PSF anisotropy in radial and tangential profiles was chiefly influenced by DOI resolution and only marginally by virtual detector size. Spatial degradation introduced by virtual cylinders was most prominent in the axial profile. All virtual cylinders achieved sub-millimetre volumetric resolution across the FOV when 6-bin DOI reconstructions (3.3 mm DOI resolution) were performed. Using vPET2 with 6 DOI bins yielded nearly identical reconstructions to the non-virtual case in the transaxial plane, with an LOR compression factor of 86%. Resolution modelling significantly reduced the effects of the asymmetric PSF arising from the non-cylindrical geometry of mousePET.Significance.Narrow bore and high resolution PET scanners require detectors with DOI capability, leading to computationally demanding reconstructions due to the large number of LORs. In this study, we show that DOI PET reconstruction with 50%-86% LOR compression is possible using virtual cylinders while maintaining sub-millimetre spatial resolution throughout the FOV. The methodology and analysis can be extended to other scanners with DOI capability intended for high resolution PET imaging.

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Objective. In this paper, we propose positron emission tomography image reconstruction using a multi-resolution triangular mesh. The mesh can be adapted based on patient specific anatomical information that can be in the form of a computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging image in the hybrid imaging systems. The triangular mesh can be adapted to high resolution in localized anatomical regions of interest (ROI) and made coarser in other regions, leading to an imaging model with high resolution in the ROI with clearly reduced number of degrees of freedom compared to a conventional uniformly dense imaging model.Approach.We compare maximum likelihood expectation maximization reconstructions with the multi-resolution model to reconstructions using a uniformly dense mesh, a sparse mesh and regular rectangular pixel mesh. Two simulated cases are used in the comparison, with the first one using the NEMA image quality phantom and the second the XCAT human phantom.Main results.When compared to the results with the uniform imaging models, the locally refined multi-resolution mesh retains the accuracy of the dense mesh reconstruction in the ROI while being faster to compute than the reconstructions with the uniformly dense mesh. The locally dense multi-resolution model leads also to more accurate reconstruction than the pixel-based mesh or the sparse triangular mesh.Significance.The findings suggest that triangular multi-resolution mesh, which can be made patient and application specific, is a potential alternative for pixel-based reconstruction.

TITLE: Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm for PET Image Reconstruction: Concept

AUTHORS: Mohamed Abouhawwash, Adam M Alessio

JOURNAL: IEEE transactions on medical imaging

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
In many diagnostic imaging settings, including positron emission tomography (PET), images are typically used for multiple tasks such as detecting disease and quantifying disease. Unlike conventional image reconstruction that optimizes a single objective, this work proposes a multi-objective optimization algorithm for PET image reconstruction to identify a set of images that are optimal for more than one task. This work is reliant on a genetic algorithm to evolve a set of solutions that satisfies two distinct objectives. In this paper, we defined the objectives as the commonly used Poisson log-likelihood function, typically reflective of quantitative accuracy, and a variant of the generalized scan-statistic model, to reflect detection performance. The genetic algorithm uses new mutation and crossover operations at each iteration. After each iteration, the child population is selected with non-dominated sorting to identify the set of solutions along the dominant front or fronts. After multiple iterations, these fronts approach a single non-dominated optimal front, defined as the set of PET images for which none the objective function values can be improved without reducing the opposing objective function. This method was applied to simulated 2D PET data of the heart and liver with hot features. We compared this approach to conventional, single-objective approaches for trading off performance: maximum likelihood estimation with increasing explicit regularization and maximum a posteriori estimation with varying penalty strength. Results demonstrate that the proposed method generates solutions with comparable to improved objective function values compared to the conventional approaches for trading off performance amongst different tasks. In addition, this approach identifies a diverse set of solutions in the multi-objective function space which can be challenging to estimate with single-objective formulations.

AUTHORS: Kibo Ote, Fumio Hashimoto

JOURNAL: Radiological physics and technology

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Although deep learning for application in positron emission tomography (PET) image reconstruction has attracted the attention of researchers, the image quality must be further improved. In this study, we propose a novel convolutional neural network (CNN)-based fast time-of-flight PET (TOF-PET) image reconstruction method to fully utilize the direction information of coincidence events. The proposed method inputs view-grouped histo-images into a 3D CNN as a multi-channel image to use the direction information of such events. We evaluated the proposed method using Monte Carlo simulation data obtained from a digital brain phantom. Compared with a case without direction information, the peak signal-to-noise ratio and structural similarity were improved by 1.2 dB and 0.02, respectively, at a coincidence time resolution of 300 ps. The calculation times of the proposed method were significantly lower than those of a conventional iterative reconstruction. These results indicate that the proposed method improves both the speed and image quality of a TOF-PET image reconstruction.

JOURNAL: Radiological physics and technology

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Deep learning, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), has advanced positron emission tomography (PET) image reconstruction. However, it requires extensive, high-quality training datasets. Unsupervised learning methods, such as deep image prior (DIP), have shown promise for PET image reconstruction. Although DIP-based PET image reconstruction methods demonstrate superior performance, they involve highly time-consuming calculations. This study proposed a two-step optimization method to accelerate end-to-end DIP-based PET image reconstruction and improve PET image quality. The proposed two-step method comprised a pre-training step using conditional DIP denoising, followed by an end-to-end reconstruction step with fine-tuning. Evaluations using Monte Carlo simulation data demonstrated that the proposed two-step method significantly reduced the computation time and improved the image quality, thereby rendering it a practical and efficient approach for end-to-end DIP-based PET image reconstruction.

TITLE: Dynamic low-count PET image reconstruction using spatio-temporal primal dual network

AUTHORS: Rui Hu, Jianan Cui, Chenxu Li, Chengjin Yu, Yunmei Chen, Huafeng Liu

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Objective.Dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, which can provide information on dynamic changes in physiological metabolism, is now widely used in clinical diagnosis and cancer treatment. However, the reconstruction from dynamic data is extremely challenging due to the limited counts received in individual frame, especially in ultra short frames. Recently, the unrolled model-based deep learning methods have shown inspiring results for low-count PET image reconstruction with good interpretability. Nevertheless, the existing model-based deep learning methods mainly focus on the spatial correlations while ignore the temporal domain.Approach.In this paper, inspired by the learned primal dual (LPD) algorithm, we propose the spatio-temporal primal dual network (STPDnet) for dynamic low-count PET image reconstruction. Both spatial and temporal correlations are encoded by 3D convolution operators. The physical projection of PET is embedded in the iterative learning process of the network, which provides the physical constraints and enhances interpretability.Main results.The experiments of both simulation data and real rat scan data have shown that the proposed method can achieve substantial noise reduction in both temporal and spatial domains and outperform the maximum likelihood expectation maximization, spatio-temporal kernel method, LPD and FBPnet.Significance.Experimental results show STPDnet better reconstruction performance in the low count situation, which makes the proposed method particularly suitable in whole-body dynamic imaging and parametric PET imaging that require extreme short frames and usually suffer from high level of noise.

TITLE: Neural KEM: A Kernel Method With Deep Coefficient Prior for PET Image Reconstruction

AUTHORS: Siqi Li, Kuang Gong, Ramsey D Badawi, Edward J Kim, Jinyi Qi, Guobao Wang

JOURNAL: IEEE transactions on medical imaging

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Image reconstruction of low-count positron emission tomography (PET) data is challenging. Kernel methods address the challenge by incorporating image prior information in the forward model of iterative PET image reconstruction. The kernelized expectation-maximization (KEM) algorithm has been developed and demonstrated to be effective and easy to implement. A common approach for a further improvement of the kernel method would be adding an explicit regularization, which however leads to a complex optimization problem. In this paper, we propose an implicit regularization for the kernel method by using a deep coefficient prior, which represents the kernel coefficient image in the PET forward model using a convolutional neural-network. To solve the maximum-likelihood neural network-based reconstruction problem, we apply the principle of optimization transfer to derive a neural KEM algorithm. Each iteration of the algorithm consists of two separate steps: a KEM step for image update from the projection data and a deep-learning step in the image domain for updating the kernel coefficient image using the neural network. This optimization algorithm is guaranteed to monotonically increase the data likelihood. The results from computer simulations and real patient data have demonstrated that the neural KEM can outperform existing KEM and deep image prior methods.

TITLE: Image reconstruction parameters and the standardized uptake value ratios in brain amyloid PET

AUTHORS: Nii Takeshi, Hosokawa Shota, Kotani Tomoya, Nakamura Yasunori, Kondo Ryotaro, Takahashi Yasuyuki

JOURNAL: Nuclear medicine communications

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Objectives: The present study investigated various image reconstruction protocols for amyloid PET using phantom test criteria published by the Japanese Society of Nuclear Medicine (JSNM) and compared them with the composite standardized uptake value ratio (cSUVR) in clinical imaging.

Methods: Hoffman 3D phantoms and cylindrical phantoms were collected for 30 min according to the JSNM guidelines. Images were created under various reconstruction protocols by three physical evaluation items in the guidelines and were assessed: gray matter/white matter contrast (%contrast), uniformity (SDuROImean), and image noise [coefficient of variation (CV)]. We compared the cSUVR of images reconstructed under 15 protocols using 18F-flutemetamol and 18F-florbetapir in 15 cases each and the guidelines for physical evaluation of reconstruction parameters.

Results: No significant differences were observed in cSUVR between reconstruction protocols that satisfied the guidelines' criteria for %contrast and CV and those that did not; however, the visual impression of images differed. SDuROImean, which evaluated uniformity, met the criteria in all data.

Conclusion: Reconstruction protocols should be selected appropriately using guidelines and other information, as cSUVR remains largely the same even if the visual impression of the images differs between different reconstruction protocols. When the relationship between %contrast and CV is expressed in terms of several reconstruction protocols, the graph shows a curved shape, and the optimal protocols for both %contrast and CV are near its center. Since cSUVR is similar to optimal parameters, even under parameters outside this range, multiple parameters need to be considered when selecting image reconstruction protocols for amyloid PET.

TITLE: Direct Reconstruction of Linear Parametric Images From Dynamic PET Using Nonlocal Deep Image Prior

AUTHORS: Kuang Gong, Ciprian Catana, Jinyi Qi, Quanzheng Li

JOURNAL: IEEE transactions on medical imaging

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Direct reconstruction methods have been developed to estimate parametric images directly from the measured PET sinograms by combining the PET imaging model and tracer kinetics in an integrated framework. Due to limited counts received, signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) and resolution of parametric images produced by direct reconstruction frameworks are still limited. Recently supervised deep learning methods have been successfully applied to medical imaging denoising/reconstruction when large number of high-quality training labels are available. For static PET imaging, high-quality training labels can be acquired by extending the scanning time. However, this is not feasible for dynamic PET imaging, where the scanning time is already long enough. In this work, we proposed an unsupervised deep learning framework for direct parametric reconstruction from dynamic PET, which was tested on the Patlak model and the relative equilibrium Logan model. The training objective function was based on the PET statistical model. The patient's anatomical prior image, which is readily available from PET/CT or PET/MR scans, was supplied as the network input to provide a manifold constraint, and also utilized to construct a kernel layer to perform non-local feature denoising. The linear kinetic model was embedded in the network structure as a 1 ×1 ×1 convolution layer. Evaluations based on dynamic datasets of18F-FDG and11C-PiB tracers show that the proposed framework can outperform the traditional and the kernel method-based direct reconstruction methods.

TITLE: Rapid high-quality PET Patlak parametric image generation based on direct reconstruction and temporal nonlocal neural network

AUTHORS: Nuobei Xie, Kuang Gong, Ning Guo, Zhixing Qin, Zhifang Wu, Huafeng Liu, Quanzheng Li

JOURNAL: NeuroImage

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Parametric imaging based on dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) has wide applications in neurology. Compared to indirect methods, direct reconstruction methods, which reconstruct parametric images directly from the raw PET data, have superior image quality due to better noise modeling and richer information extracted from the PET raw data. For low-dose scenarios, the advantages of direct methods are more obvious. However, the wide adoption of direct reconstruction is inevitably impeded by the excessive computational demand and deficiency of the accessible raw data. In addition, motion modeling inside dynamic PET image reconstruction raises more computational challenges for direct reconstruction methods. In this work, we focused on the18F-FDG Patlak model, and proposed a data-driven approach which can estimate the motion corrected full-dose direct Patlak images from the dynamic PET reconstruction series, based on a proposed novel temporal non-local convolutional neural network. During network training, direct reconstruction with motion correction based on full-dose dynamic PET sinograms was performed to obtain the training labels. The reconstructed full-dose /low-dose dynamic PET images were supplied as the network input. In addition, a temporal non-local block based on the dynamic PET images was proposed to better recover the structural information and reduce the image noise. During testing, the proposed network can directly output high-quality Patlak parametric images from the full-dose /low-dose dynamic PET images in seconds. Experiments based on 15 full-dose and 15 low-dose18F-FDG brain datasets were conducted and analyzed to validate the feasibility of the proposed framework. Results show that the proposed framework can generate better image quality than reference methods.

JOURNAL: IEEE transactions on medical imaging

ABSTRACT:
Low-count positron emission tomography (PET) imaging is challenging because of the ill-posedness of this inverse problem. Previous studies have demonstrated that deep learning (DL) holds promise for achieving improved low-count PET image quality. However, almost all data-driven DL methods suffer from fine structure degradation and blurring effects after denoising. Incorporating DL into the traditional iterative optimization model can effectively improve its image quality and recover fine structures, but little research has considered the full relaxation of the model, resulting in the performance of this hybrid model not being sufficiently exploited. In this paper, we propose a learning framework that deeply integrates DL and an alternating direction of multipliers method (ADMM)-based iterative optimization model. The innovative feature of this method is that we break the inherent forms of the fidelity operators and use neural networks to process them. The regularization term is deeply generalized. The proposed method is evaluated on simulated data and real data. Both the qualitative and quantitative results show that our proposed neural network method can outperform partial operator expansion-based neural network methods, neural network denoising methods and traditional methods.

TITLE: Texture features-guided image reconstruction kernel method for18F-FDG delayed PET imaging

AUTHORS: Zhichao Song, Jianping Zhang, Zixiang Chen, Zhenxing Huang, Wenbo Li, Xi Fang, Catherine C Liu, Yunlong Gao, Yihan Wang, Yongfeng Yang, Hairong Zheng, Dong Liang, Shaoli Song, Zhanli Hu

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Objective.Positron emission tomography (PET) is a crucial imaging technology that is widely used for cancer staging and treatment response assessment. Delayed PET imaging (or dual-time-point imaging) involves a second PET acquisition step approximately 33 min after the initial scan in this study, providing more dynamic biological information, improving lesion detectability, and allowing patients to rest during the scan. However, with increasing time, the number of photons in the second scan decreases, which raises the difficulty of the second PET image reconstruction process. Due to the extended time between the tracer injection step and the second PET scan, the photon count during the second scan decreases, leading to difficulties when reconstructing the second PET image. To effectively reconstruct the second image, we propose a new reconstruction algorithm that utilizes texture features from the first PET image to assist in reconstructing the second PET image.Approach.In this study, to effectively reconstruct delayed-scan PET images, we propose a novel reconstruction method. This method introduces texture features from the first PET image to assist in the process of reconstructing the second PET image, thereby enabling the PET images to more effectively retain their clinical significance. We extract texture features using the gray level co-occurrence matrix, then combine these features with additional gray-level characteristics to form a new feature vector, which is subsequently incorporated into the kernel-based reconstruction method, enhancing the reconstruction process and improving the quality of the delayed PET image reconstruction. We used the peak signal-to-noise ratio, the mean absolute error and structural similarity index measure (SSIM) as image quality assessment metrics and compared our method with other existing reconstruction methods. In addition, we conducted a more detailed comparison across regions of interest (ROIs).Main results.Our experiments were conducted with data acquired from 32 real patients. Compared with other competing methods, our approach achieved a certain level of improvement, with a PSNR value of 32.53 dB and an SSIM of 0.904. Relative to those of the maximum likelihood expectation maximization method, these metrics improved by 13% and 7%, respectively. Within the ROIs, our method also showed closer agreement with the ground truth, preserving the highly metabolic regions in the images.Significance.Our method represents a novel application of reconstruction techniques to delayed imaging, incorporating heterogeneous texture features from prior images for the first time. This approach significantly advances the field of medical image processing by improving the reconstruction quality of delayed PET images, providing clinicians with more reliable and detailed information for patient care. Clinically, the texture features in delayed imaging provide structural information that eliminates the need for CT attenuation correction during delayed PET scans, thereby reducing patient radiation exposure and minimizing the risks associated with repeated scanning.

TITLE: An encoder-decoder network for direct image reconstruction on sinograms of a long axial field of view PET

AUTHORS: Ruiyao Ma, Jiaxi Hu, Hasan Sari, Song Xue, Clemens Mingels, Marco Viscione, Venkata Sai Sundar Kandarpa, Wei Bo Li, Dimitris Visvikis, Rui Qiu, Axel Rominger, Junli Li, Kuangyu Shi

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Deep learning is an emerging reconstruction method for positron emission tomography (PET), which can tackle complex PET corrections in an integrated procedure. This paper optimizes the direct PET reconstruction from sinogram on a long axial field of view (LAFOV) PET.

Methods: This paper proposes a novel deep learning architecture to reduce the biases during direct reconstruction from sinograms to images. This architecture is based on an encoder-decoder network, where the perceptual loss is used with pre-trained convolutional layers. It is trained and tested on data of 80 patients acquired from recent Siemens Biograph Vision Quadra long axial FOV (LAFOV) PET/CT. The patients are randomly split into a training dataset of 60 patients, a validation dataset of 10 patients, and a test dataset of 10 patients. The 3D sinograms are converted into 2D sinogram slices and used as input to the network. In addition, the vendor reconstructed images are considered as ground truths. Finally, the proposed method is compared with DeepPET, a benchmark deep learning method for PET reconstruction.

Results: Compared with DeepPET, the proposed network significantly reduces the root-mean-squared error (NRMSE) from 0.63 to 0.6 (p &lt; 0.01) and increases the structural similarity index (SSIM) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) from 0.93 to 0.95 (p &lt; 0.01) and from 82.02 to 82.36 (p &lt; 0.01), respectively. The reconstruction time is approximately 10 s per patient, which is shortened by 23 times compared with the conventional method. The errors of mean standardized uptake values (SUVmean) for lesions between ground truth and the predicted result are reduced from 33.5 to 18.7% (p = 0.03). In addition, the error of max SUV is reduced from 32.7 to 21.8% (p = 0.02).

Conclusion: The results demonstrate the feasibility of using deep learning to reconstruct images with acceptable image quality and short reconstruction time. It is shown that the proposed method can improve the quality of deep learning-based reconstructed images without additional CT images for attenuation and scattering corrections. This study demonstrated the feasibility of deep learning to rapidly reconstruct images without additional CT images for complex corrections from actual clinical measurements on LAFOV PET. Despite improving the current development, AI-based reconstruction does not work appropriately for untrained scenarios due to limited extrapolation capability and cannot completely replace conventional reconstruction currently.

TITLE: Dynamic PET image reconstruction incorporating a median nonlocal means kernel method

AUTHORS: Shuangliang Cao, Yuru He, Hao Sun, Huiqin Wu, Wufan Chen, Lijun Lu

JOURNAL: Computers in biology and medicine

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
In dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, the reconstructed image of a single frame often exhibits high noise due to limited counting statistics of projection data. This study proposed a median nonlocal means (MNLM)-based kernel method for dynamic PET image reconstruction. The kernel matrix is derived from median nonlocal means of pre-reconstructed composite images. Then the PET image intensities in all voxels were modeled as a kernel matrix multiplied by coefficients and incorporated into the forward model of PET projection data. Then, the coefficients of each feature were estimated by the maximum likelihood method. Using simulated low-count dynamic data of Zubal head phantom, the quantitative performance of the proposed MNLM kernel method was investigated and compared with the maximum-likelihood method, conventional kernel method with and without median filter, and nonlocal means (NLM) kernel method. Simulation results showed that the MNLM kernel method achieved visual and quantitative accuracy improvements (in terms of the ensemble mean squared error, bias versus variance, and contrast versus noise performances). Especially for frame 2 with the lowest count level of a single frame, the MNLM kernel method achieves lower ensemble mean squared error (10.43%) than the NLM kernel method (13.68%), conventional kernel method with and without median filter (11.88% and 23.50%), and MLEM algorithm (24.77%). The study on real low-dose18F-FDG rat data also showed that the MNLM kernel method outperformed other methods in visual and quantitative accuracy improvements (in terms of regional noise versus intensity mean performance).

JOURNAL: BMC cancer

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Background: New-generation silicon-photomultiplier (SiPM)-based PET/CT systems exhibit an improved lesion detectability and image quality due to a higher detector sensitivity. Consequently, the acquisition time can be reduced while maintaining diagnostic quality. The aim of this study was to determine the lowest18F-FDG PET acquisition time without loss of diagnostic information and to optimise image reconstruction parameters (image reconstruction algorithm, number of iterations, voxel size, Gaussian filter) by phantom imaging. Moreover, patient data are evaluated to confirm the phantom results.

Methods: Three phantoms were used: a soft-tissue tumour phantom, a bone-lung tumour phantom, and a resolution phantom. Phantom conditions (lesion sizes from 6.5 mm to 28.8 mm in diameter, lesion activity concentration of 15 kBq/mL, and signal-to-background ratio of 5:1) were derived from patient data. PET data were acquired on an SiPM-based Biograph Vision PET/CT system for 10 min in list-mode format and resampled into time frames from 30 to 300 s in 30-s increments to simulate different acquisition times. Different image reconstructions with varying iterations, voxel sizes, and Gaussian filters were probed. Contrast-to-noise-ratio (CNR), maximum, and peak signal were evaluated using the 10-min acquisition time image as reference. A threshold CNR value ≥ 5 and a maximum (peak) deviation of ± 20% were considered acceptable. 20 patient data sets were evaluated regarding lesion quantification as well as agreement and correlation between reduced and full acquisition time standard uptake values (assessed by Pearson correlation coefficient, intraclass correlation coefficient, Bland-Altman analyses, and Krippendorff's alpha).

Results: An acquisition time of 60 s per bed position yielded acceptable detectability and quantification results for clinically relevant phantom lesions ≥ 9.7 mm in diameter using OSEM-TOF or OSEM-TOF+PSF image reconstruction, a 4-mm Gaussian filter, and a 1.65 × 1.65 x 2.00-mm3or 3.30 × 3.30 x 3.00-mm3voxel size. Correlation and agreement of patient lesion quantification between full and reduced acquisition times were excellent.

Conclusion: A threefold reduction in acquisition time is possible. Patients might benefit from more comfortable examinations or reduced radiation exposure, if instead of the acquisition time the applied activity is reduced.

TITLE: Impact of list-mode reconstruction and image-space point spread function correction on PET image contrast and quantitative value using SiPM-based PET/CT system

AUTHORS: Yuya Shirakawa, Norikazu Matsutomo

JOURNAL: Radiological physics and technology

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
We evaluate the effects of list-mode reconstruction and the image-space point spread function (iPSF) on the contrast and quantitative values of positron emission tomography (PET) images using a SiPM-PET/CT system. The evaluation is conducted on an NEMA body phantom and clinical images using a Cartesion Prime SiPM-PET/CT system. The signal-to-background ratio (SBR) of the phantom is set to 2, 4, 6, and 8, and all the PET image data are obtained and reconstructed using 3D-OSEM, time-of-flight, iPSF (-/ +), and a 4-mm Gaussian filter with several iterations. The evaluation criteria include % background variability (NB,10 mm), % contrast (QH,10 mm), iPSF change in QH,10 mm(ΔQH,10 mm) for edge artifact evaluation, profile curves, visual evaluation of edge artifacts, clinical imaging for the standardized uptake value (SUV) of lung nodules, and SNRliver. NB,10 mmdemonstrates no significant difference in all SBRs with and without iPSF, whereas QH,10 mmis higher based on the SBR with and without iPSF. ΔQH,10 mmindicates increased iterations and a larger rate of change (> 5%) for small spheres of < 17 mm. The profile curves portrayed almost real concentrations, except for the 10-mm sphere of SBR2 without iPSF; however, with iPSF, an overshoot was observed in the 13-mm sphere of all SBRs. The degree of overshoot increased with increasing iteration and SBR. Edge artifacts were detected at values ≥ 17-22 mm in SBRs other than SBR2 with iPSF. Irrespective of the nodal size, SUV and SNRliverimproved considerably after iPSF adjustment. Therefore, the effects of list-mode reconstruction and iPSF on PET image contrast were limited, and the overcorrection of the quantitative values was validated using iPSF.

TITLE: ReconU-Net: a direct PET image reconstruction using U-Net architecture with back projection-induced skip connection

AUTHORS: Fumio Hashimoto, Kibo Ote

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Objective.This study aims to introduce a novel back projection-induced U-Net-shaped architecture, called ReconU-Net, based on the original U-Net architecture for deep learning-based direct positron emission tomography (PET) image reconstruction. Additionally, our objective is to visualize the behavior of direct PET image reconstruction by comparing the proposed ReconU-Net architecture with the original U-Net architecture and existing DeepPET encoder-decoder architecture without skip connections.Approach. The proposed ReconU-Net architecture uniquely integrates the physical model of the back projection operation into the skip connection. This distinctive feature facilitates the effective transfer of intrinsic spatial information from the input sinogram to the reconstructed image via an embedded physical model. The proposed ReconU-Net was trained using Monte Carlo simulation data from the Brainweb phantom and tested on both simulated and real Hoffman brain phantom data.Main results. The proposed ReconU-Net method provided better reconstructed image in terms of the peak signal-to-noise ratio and contrast recovery coefficient than the original U-Net and DeepPET methods. Further analysis shows that the proposed ReconU-Net architecture has the ability to transfer features of multiple resolutions, especially non-abstract high-resolution information, through skip connections. Unlike the U-Net and DeepPET methods, the proposed ReconU-Net successfully reconstructed the real Hoffman brain phantom, despite limited training on simulated data.Significance. The proposed ReconU-Net can improve the fidelity of direct PET image reconstruction, even with small training datasets, by leveraging the synergistic relationship between data-driven modeling and the physics model of the imaging process.

TITLE: Impact of image reconstruction method on dose distributions derived from 90Y PET images: phantom and liver radioembolization patient studies

AUTHORS: Xinchi Hou, Hillgan Ma, Pedro L Esquinas, Carlos Uribe, Stefano Tolhurst, François Bénard, David Liu, Arman Rahmim, Anna Celler

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
PET images acquired after liver90Y radioembolization therapies are typically very noisy, which significantly challenges both visualization and quantification of activity distributions. To improve their noise characteristics, regularized iterative reconstruction algorithms such as block sequential regularized expectation maximization (Q.Clear for GE Healthcare, USA) have been proposed. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects which different reconstruction algorithms may have on patient images, with reconstruction parameters initially narrowed down using phantom studies. Moreover, we evaluated the impact of these reconstruction methods on voxel-based dose distribution in phantom and patient studies (lesions and healthy livers). The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC)/NEMA phantom, containing six spheres, was filled with90Y and imaged using a GE Discovery 690 PET/CT scanner with time-of-flight enabled. The images were reconstructed using Q.Clear (with β parameter ranging from 0 to 8000) and ordered subsets expectation maximization. The image quality and quantification accuracy were evaluated by computing the hot ([Formula: see text]) and cold ([Formula: see text]) contrast recovery coefficients, background variability (BV) and activity bias. Next, dose distributions and dose volume histograms were generated using MIM® software's SurePlan LiverY90 toolbox. Subsequently, parameters optimized in these phantom studies were applied to five patient datasets. Dose parameters, such as Dmax, Dmean, D70, and V100Gy, were estimated, and their variability for different reconstruction methods was investigated. Based on phantom studies, the β parameter values optimized for image quality and quantification accuracy were 2500 and 300, respectively. When all investigated reconstructions were applied to patient studies, Dmean, D50, D70, and V100Gyshowed coefficients of variation below 8%; whereas the variability of Dmaxwas up to 30% for both phantom and patient images. Although β = 300-1000 would provide accurate activity quantification for a region of interest, when considering activity/dose voxelized distribution, higher β value (e.g. 4000-5000) would provide the greatest accuracy for dose distributions. In this90Y radioembolization PET/CT study, the β parameter in regularized iterative (Q.Clear) reconstruction was investigated for image quality, accurate quantification and dose distributions based on phantom experiments and then applied to patient studies. Our results indicate that more accurate dose distribution can be achieved from smoother PET images, reconstructed with larger β values than those yielding the best activity quantifications but noisy images. Most importantly, these results suggest that quantitative measures, which are commonly used in clinics, such as SUVmaxor SUVpeak( equivalent of Dmax), should not be employed for90Y PET images, since their values would highly depend on the image reconstruction.

ABSTRACT:
Positron emission tomography (PET) is a noninvasive functional imaging modality that involves in vivo detection of spatiotemporal changes in the binding of radioactive pharmaceuticals (a.k.a. PET tracers) to their target sites in different organs. The development of new PET tracers commonly involves their preclinical evaluation in small rodents. Moreover, laboratory animal PET research is now being used with progressively greater frequency to complement human PET studies, to investigate in greater depth the underlying pathophysiology of human diseases, and to monitor the efficiency of novel therapeutic interventions. Here we describe the steps toward a successful small animal PET study, from tracer formulation and image acquisition to data reconstruction and analysis of the acquired scans, with a particular focus on its utility for the brain.

TITLE: PET/CT Image Artifacts Caused by the Arms

AUTHORS: Ismet Sarikaya, Ali Sarikaya

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear medicine technology

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
PET/CT images are usually obtained in the arms-up position in patients with no head and neck pathology and in the arms-down position to image the head and neck area. The arms usually cause artifacts regardless of up or down positioning. These artifacts include beam hardening, scatter, truncation, and cold areas (cold artifacts) in obese or large patients; motion artifacts; implanted-metal-object artifacts; and artifacts related to radiotracer extravasation at the injection site. In this review article, we will discuss the mechanisms of these artifacts and suggest solutions to reduce or eliminate them, such as reviewing the non-attenuation-corrected PET images, performing extended-field-of-view reconstruction, not applying scatter correction, and using software to correct beam-hardening, scatter, and truncation artifacts. We will present various PET/CT images before and after corrections for such artifacts.

TITLE: Technical Note: A preliminary study of dual-tracer PET image reconstruction guided by FDG and/or MR kernels

AUTHORS: Haiyan Wang, Zhenxing Huang, Qiyang Zhang, Dongfang Gao, Zhanglei OuYang, Dong Liang, Xin Liu, Yongfeng Yang, Hairong Zheng, Zhanli Hu

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Clinically, single radiotracer positron emission tomography (PET) imaging is a commonly used examination method; however, since each radioactive tracer reflects the information of only one kind of cell, it easily causes false negatives or false positives in disease diagnosis. Therefore, reasonably combining two or more radiotracers is recommended to improve the accuracy of diagnosis and the sensitivity and specificity of the disease when conditions permit.

Methods: This paper proposes incorporating18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) as a higher-quality PET image to guide the reconstruction of other lower-count11C-methionine (MET) PET datasets to compensate for the lower image quality by a popular kernel algorithm. Specifically, the FDG prior is needed to extract kernel features, and these features were used to build a kernel matrix using a k-nearest-neighbor (kNN) search for MET image reconstruction. We created a 2-D brain phantom to validate the proposed method by simulating sinogram data containing Poisson random noise and quantitatively compared the performance of the proposed FDG-guided kernelized expectation maximization (KEM) method with the performance of Gaussian and non-local means (NLM) smoothed maximum likelihood expectation maximization (MLEM), MR-guided KEM, and multi-guided-S KEM algorithms. Mismatch experiments between FDG/MR and MET data were also carried out to investigate the outcomes of possible clinical situations.

Results: In the simulation study, the proposed method outperformed the other algorithms by at least 3.11% in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and 0.68% in the contrast recovery coefficient (CRC), and it reduced the mean absolute error (MAE) by 8.07%. Regarding the tumor in the reconstructed image, the proposed method contained more pathological information. Furthermore, the proposed method was still superior to the MR-guided KEM method in the mismatch experiments.

Conclusions: The proposed FDG-guided KEM algorithm can effectively utilize and compensate for the tissue metabolism information obtained from dual-tracer PET to maximize the advantages of PET imaging.

TITLE: Single-Subject Deep-Learning Image Reconstruction With a Neural Optimization Transfer Algorithm for PET-Enabled Dual-Energy CT Imaging

AUTHORS: Siqi Li, Yansong Zhu, Benjamin A Spencer, Guobao Wang

JOURNAL: IEEE transactions on image processing : a publication of the IEEE Signal Processing Society

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Combining dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) with positron emission tomography (PET) offers many potential clinical applications but typically requires expensive hardware upgrades or increases radiation doses on PET/CT scanners due to an extra X-ray CT scan. The recent PET-enabled DECT method allows DECT imaging on PET/CT without requiring a second X-ray CT scan. It combines the already existing X-ray CT image with a 511 keV γ -ray CT (gCT) image reconstructed from time-of-flight PET emission data. A kernelized framework has been developed for reconstructing gCT image but this method has not fully exploited the potential of prior knowledge. Use of deep neural networks may explore the power of deep learning in this application. However, common approaches require a large database for training, which is impractical for a new imaging method like PET-enabled DECT. Here, we propose a single-subject method by using neural-network representation as a deep coefficient prior to improving gCT image reconstruction without population-based pre-training. The resulting optimization problem becomes the tomographic estimation of nonlinear neural-network parameters from gCT projection data. This complicated problem can be efficiently solved by utilizing the optimization transfer strategy with quadratic surrogates. Each iteration of the proposed neural optimization transfer algorithm includes: PET activity image update; gCT image update; and least-square neural-network learning in the gCT image domain. This algorithm is guaranteed to monotonically increase the data likelihood. Results from computer simulation, real phantom data and real patient data have demonstrated that the proposed method can significantly improve gCT image quality and consequent multi-material decomposition as compared to other methods.

TITLE: Joint motion estimation and penalized image reconstruction algorithm with anatomical priors for gated TOF-PET/CT

AUTHORS: Yu-Jung Tsai, Chi Liu

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
The presence of respiratory motion not only degrades the reconstructed image but also limits the utilization of anatomical priors in emission tomography. In this study, we explore the potential application of a joint motion estimation and penalized image reconstruction algorithm using anatomical priors in gated time-of-flight positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT). The algorithm is able to warp both the activity image and the attenuation map to align them with the measured data with the facilitation of anatomical information contained in the attenuation map. Five patient datasets, three acquired in single-bed position and two acquired in whole-body continuous-bed-motion mode, are included. For each patient, the attenuation map is derived from a breath-hold CT. The Parallel Levels Sets (PLS) is chosen as a representative anatomical prior. In addition to demonstrating the reliability of the estimated motion and the benefits of incorporating anatomical prior, preliminary results also indicate that the algorithm shows the potential to reconstruct an activity image in the space corresponding to that of the attenuation map, which could be applied to address the potential misalignment issue in applications involving multiple PET acquisitions but a single CT.

TITLE: Total variation regularized expectation maximization reconstruction improves 68Ga-FAPI-04 PET/CT image quality as compared to ordered subset expectation maximization reconstruction

AUTHORS: Hanxiang Liu, Lin Liu, Shijie Xu, Zhonglin Lu, Greta S Mok, Yingwei Wang, Yi Tao, Yue Chen

JOURNAL: The quarterly journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging : official publication of the Italian Association of Nuclear Medicine (AIMN) [and] the International Association of Radiopharmacology (IAR), [and] Section of the Society of...

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Background: This study aimed to investigate improvements in68Ga-FAPI PET/CT image quality due to using total variation regularized expectation maximization (TVR-EM) and ordered subset expectation maximization (OS-EM) reconstruction.

Methods: Data from a total of 24 patients were retrospectively analyzed in this study. Positron emission tomography (PET) images were reconstructed using OS-EM and TVR-EM for 2 and 3 minutes-per-bed (min/bed) acquisition. The SUV<inf>mean</inf> of a region-of-interest on the liver, image noise, signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), the SUV<inf>max</inf> of the lesions and the tumour-to-background ratios (TBR) were measured and compared between the 2 methods. Subjective image qualities were evaluated by two experienced radiologists using a 5-point score scale (5-excellent, 1-poor).

Results: In total, 132 lesions were analyzed. The image noise in TVR-EM reconstruction groups was lower than in the OS-EM groups (all P<0.05). The SNR, SUV<inf>max</inf> of lesions and the TBR were higher for the TVR-EM reconstruction groups compared to OS-EM groups (all P<0.05). Also, the SUV<inf>max</inf> of the lesions in the TVR-EM groups increased by at least 12% compared to OS-EM 3 min/bed group. The SUV<inf>max</inf> for small (<10 mm) and large lesions (>10 mm) in the TVR-EM 2 min/bed group were significantly larger compared to the OS-EM 3 min/bed groups (all P<0.05). The highest image quality score resulted from the TVR-EM 3 min/bed group with a penalization factor of 0.25 (3.92±0.19).

Conclusions: TVR-EM reduces image noise and improved the SNR, SUV<inf>max</inf> and TBR of the lesions. It also enables fast acquisition without compromising image quality compared to standard OS-EM.

TITLE: Fully 3D implementation of the end-to-end deep image prior-based PET image reconstruction using block iterative algorithm

AUTHORS: Fumio Hashimoto, Yuya Onishi, Kibo Ote, Hideaki Tashima, Taiga Yamaya

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Objective. Deep image prior (DIP) has recently attracted attention owing to its unsupervised positron emission tomography (PET) image reconstruction method, which does not require any prior training dataset. In this paper, we present the first attempt to implement an end-to-end DIP-based fully 3D PET image reconstruction method that incorporates a forward-projection model into a loss function.Approach. A practical implementation of a fully 3D PET image reconstruction could not be performed at present because of a graphics processing unit memory limitation. Consequently, we modify the DIP optimization to a block iteration and sequential learning of an ordered sequence of block sinograms. Furthermore, the relative difference penalty (RDP) term is added to the loss function to enhance the quantitative accuracy of the PET image.Main results. We evaluated our proposed method using Monte Carlo simulation with [18F]FDG PET data of a human brain and a preclinical study on monkey-brain [18F]FDG PET data. The proposed method was compared with the maximum-likelihood expectation maximization (EM), maximuma posterioriEM with RDP, and hybrid DIP-based PET reconstruction methods. The simulation results showed that, compared with other algorithms, the proposed method improved the PET image quality by reducing statistical noise and better preserved the contrast of brain structures and inserted tumors. In the preclinical experiment, finer structures and better contrast recovery were obtained with the proposed method.Significance.The results indicated that the proposed method could produce high-quality images without a prior training dataset. Thus, the proposed method could be a key enabling technology for the straightforward and practical implementation of end-to-end DIP-based fully 3D PET image reconstruction.

JOURNAL: Medical image analysis

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Medical image synthesis represents a critical area of research in clinical decision-making, aiming to overcome the challenges associated with acquiring multiple image modalities for an accurate clinical workflow. This approach proves beneficial in estimating an image of a desired modality from a given source modality among the most common medical imaging contrasts, such as Computed Tomography (CT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), and Positron Emission Tomography (PET). However, translating between two image modalities presents difficulties due to the complex and non-linear domain mappings. Deep learning-based generative modelling has exhibited superior performance in synthetic image contrast applications compared to conventional image synthesis methods. This survey comprehensively reviews deep learning-based medical imaging translation from 2018 to 2023 on pseudo-CT, synthetic MR, and synthetic PET. We provide an overview of synthetic contrasts in medical imaging and the most frequently employed deep learning networks for medical image synthesis. Additionally, we conduct a detailed analysis of each synthesis method, focusing on their diverse model designs based on input domains and network architectures. We also analyse novel network architectures, ranging from conventional CNNs to the recent Transformer and Diffusion models. This analysis includes comparing loss functions, available datasets and anatomical regions, and image quality assessments and performance in other downstream tasks. Finally, we discuss the challenges and identify solutions within the literature, suggesting possible future directions. We hope that the insights offered in this survey paper will serve as a valuable roadmap for researchers in the field of medical image synthesis.

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Objective.Unsupervised learning-based methods have been proven to be an effective way to improve the image quality of positron emission tomography (PET) images when a large dataset is not available. However, when the gap between the input image and the target PET image is large, direct unsupervised learning can be challenging and easily lead to reduced lesion detectability. We aim to develop a new unsupervised learning method to improve lesion detectability in patient studies.Approach.We applied the deep progressive learning strategy to bridge the gap between the input image and the target image. The one-step unsupervised learning is decomposed into two unsupervised learning steps. The input image of the first network is an anatomical image and the input image of the second network is a PET image with a low noise level. The output of the first network is also used as the prior image to generate the target image of the second network by iterative reconstruction method.Results.The performance of the proposed method was evaluated through the phantom and patient studies and compared with non-deep learning, supervised learning and unsupervised learning methods. The results showed that the proposed method was superior to non-deep learning and unsupervised methods, and was comparable to the supervised method.Significance.A progressive unsupervised learning method was proposed, which can improve image noise performance and lesion detectability.

TITLE: Direct parametric reconstruction in dynamic PET using deep image prior and a novel parameter magnification strategy

AUTHORS: Xiaotong Hong, Fanghu Wang, Hao Sun, Hossein Arabi, Lijun Lu

JOURNAL: Computers in biology and medicine

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Background/purpose: Multiple parametric imaging in positron emission tomography (PET) is challenging due to the noisy dynamic data and the complex mapping to kinetic parameters. Although methods like direct parametric reconstruction have been proposed to improve the image quality, limitations persist, particularly for nonlinear and small-value micro-parameters (e.g., k2, k3). This study presents a novel unsupervised deep learning approach to reconstruct and improve the quality of these micro-parameters.

Methods: We proposed a direct parametric image reconstruction model, DIP-PM, integrating deep image prior (DIP) with a parameter magnification (PM) strategy. The model employs a U-Net generator to predict multiple parametric images using a CT image prior, with each output channel subsequently magnified by a factor to adjust the intensity. The model was optimized with a log-likelihood loss computed between the measured projection data and forward projected data. Two tracer datasets were simulated for evaluation:82Rb data using the 1-tissue compartment (1 TC) model and18F-FDG data using the 2-tissue compartment (2 TC) model, with 10-fold magnification applied to the 1 TC k2and the 2 TC k3, respectively. DIP-PM was compared to the indirect method, direct algorithm (OTEM) and the DIP method without parameter magnification (DIP-only). Performance was assessed on phantom data using peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) and structural similarity index (SSIM), as well as on real18F-FDG scan from a male subject.

Results: For the 1 TC model, OTEM performed well in K1reconstruction, but both indirect and OTEM methods showed high noise and poor performance in k2. The DIP-only method suppressed noise in k2, but failed to reconstruct fine structures in the myocardium. DIP-PM outperformed other methods with well-preserved detailed structures, particularly in k2, achieving the best metrics (PSNR: 19.00, NRMSE: 0.3002, SSIM: 0.9289). For the 2 TC model, traditional methods exhibited high noise and blurred structures in estimating all nonlinear parameters (K1, k2, k3), while DIP-based methods significantly improved image quality. DIP-PM outperformed all methods in k3(PSNR: 21.89, NRMSE: 0.4054, SSIM: 0.8797), and consequently produced the most accurate 2 TC Kiimages (PSNR: 22.74, NRMSE: 0.4897, SSIM: 0.8391). On real FDG data, DIP-PM also showed evident advantages in estimating K1, k2and k3while preserving myocardial structures.

Conclusions: The results underscore the efficacy of the DIP-based direct parametric imaging in generating and improving quality of PET parametric images. This study suggests that the proposed DIP-PM method with the parameter magnification strategy can enhance the fidelity of nonlinear micro-parameter images.

TITLE: A deep neural network for parametric image reconstruction on a large axial field-of-view PET

AUTHORS: Y Li, J Hu, H Sari, S Xue, R Ma, S Kandarpa, D Visvikis, A Rominger, H Liu, K Shi

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: The PET scanners with long axial field of view (AFOV) having ~ 20 times higher sensitivity than conventional scanners provide new opportunities for enhanced parametric imaging but suffer from the dramatically increased volume and complexity of dynamic data. This study reconstructed a high-quality direct Patlak Ki image from five-frame sinograms without input function by a deep learning framework based on DeepPET to explore the potential of artificial intelligence reducing the acquisition time and the dependence of input function in parametric imaging.

Methods: This study was implemented on a large AFOV PET/CT scanner (Biograph Vision Quadra) and twenty patients were recruited with18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) dynamic scans. During training and testing of the proposed deep learning framework, the last five-frame (25 min, 40-65 min post-injection) sinograms were set as input and the reconstructed Patlak Ki images by a nested EM algorithm on the vendor were set as ground truth. To evaluate the image quality of predicted Ki images, mean square error (MSE), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), and structural similarity index measure (SSIM) were calculated. Meanwhile, a linear regression process was applied between predicted and true Ki means on avid malignant lesions and tumor volume of interests (VOIs).

Results: In the testing phase, the proposed method achieved excellent MSE of less than 0.03%, high SSIM, and PSNR of ~ 0.98 and ~ 38 dB, respectively. Moreover, there was a high correlation (DeepPET: [Formula: see text]= 0.73, self-attention DeepPET: [Formula: see text]=0.82) between predicted Ki and traditionally reconstructed Patlak Ki means over eleven lesions.

Conclusions: The results show that the deep learning-based method produced high-quality parametric images from small frames of projection data without input function. It has much potential to address the dilemma of the long scan time and dependency on input function that still hamper the clinical translation of dynamic PET.

AUTHORS: Cameron Dennis Pain, Gary F Egan, Zhaolin Chen

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Image processing plays a crucial role in maximising diagnostic quality of positron emission tomography (PET) images. Recently, deep learning methods developed across many fields have shown tremendous potential when applied to medical image enhancement, resulting in a rich and rapidly advancing literature surrounding this subject. This review encapsulates methods for integrating deep learning into PET image reconstruction and post-processing for low-dose imaging and resolution enhancement. A brief introduction to conventional image processing techniques in PET is firstly presented. We then review methods which integrate deep learning into the image reconstruction framework as either deep learning-based regularisation or as a fully data-driven mapping from measured signal to images. Deep learning-based post-processing methods for low-dose imaging, temporal resolution enhancement and spatial resolution enhancement are also reviewed. Finally, the challenges associated with applying deep learning to enhance PET images in the clinical setting are discussed and future research directions to address these challenges are presented.

JOURNAL: Medicinal research reviews

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Radiomics is the quantitative analysis of standard-of-care medical imaging; the information obtained can be applied within clinical decision support systems to create diagnostic, prognostic, and/or predictive models. Radiomics analysis can be performed by extracting hand-crafted radiomics features or via deep learning algorithms. Radiomics has evolved tremendously in the last decade, becoming a bridge between imaging and precision medicine. Radiomics exploits sophisticated image analysis tools coupled with statistical elaboration to extract the wealth of information hidden inside medical images, such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MR), and/or Positron emission tomography (PET) scans, routinely performed in the everyday clinical practice. Many efforts have been devoted in recent years to the standardization and validation of radiomics approaches, to demonstrate their usefulness and robustness beyond any reasonable doubts. However, the booming of publications and commercial applications of radiomics approaches warrant caution and proper understanding of all the factors involved to avoid "scientific pollution" and overly enthusiastic claims by researchers and clinicians alike. For these reasons the present review aims to be a guidebook of sorts, describing the process of radiomics, its pitfalls, challenges, and opportunities, along with its ability to improve clinical decision-making, from oncology and respiratory medicine to pharmacological and genotyping studies.

TITLE: A Fast Convergent Ordered-Subsets Algorithm With Subiteration-Dependent Preconditioners for PET Image Reconstruction

AUTHORS: Jianfeng Guo, C Ross Schmidtlein, Andrzej Krol, Si Li, Yizun Lin, Sangtae Ahn, Charles Stearns, Yuesheng Xu

JOURNAL: IEEE transactions on medical imaging

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
We investigated the imaging performance of a fast convergent ordered-subsets algorithm with subiteration-dependent preconditioners (SDPs) for positron emission tomography (PET) image reconstruction. In particular, we considered the use of SDP with the block sequential regularized expectation maximization (BSREM) approach with the relative difference prior (RDP) regularizer due to its prior clinical adaptation by vendors. Because the RDP regularization promotes smoothness in the reconstructed image, the directions of the gradients in smooth areas more accurately point toward the objective function's minimizer than those in variable areas. Motivated by this observation, two SDPs have been designed to increase iteration step-sizes in the smooth areas and reduce iteration step-sizes in the variable areas relative to a conventional expectation maximization preconditioner. The momentum technique used for convergence acceleration can be viewed as a special case of SDP. We have proved the global convergence of SDP-BSREM algorithms by assuming certain characteristics of the preconditioner. By means of numerical experiments using both simulated and clinical PET data, we have shown that the SDP-BSREM algorithms substantially improve the convergence rate, as compared to conventional BSREM and a vendor's implementation as Q.Clear. Specifically, SDP-BSREM algorithms converge 35%-50% faster in reaching the same objective function value than conventional BSREM and commercial Q.Clear algorithms. Moreover, we showed in phantoms with hot, cold and background regions that the SDP-BSREM algorithms approached the values of a highly converged reference image faster than conventional BSREM and commercial Q.Clear algorithms.

AUTHORS: Asim Afaq, David Faul, Venkata Veerendranadh Chebrolu, Simon Wan, Thomas A Hope, Patrick Veit Haibach, Jamshed Bomanji

JOURNAL: Seminars in nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
A decade of PET/MRI clinical imaging has passed and many of the pitfalls are similar to those on earlier studies. However, techniques to overcome them have emerged and continue to develop. Although clinically significant lung nodules are demonstrable, smaller nodules may be detected using ultrashort/zero echo-time (TE) lung MRI. Fast reconstruction ultrashort TE sequences have also been used to achieve high-resolution lung MRI even with free-breathing. The introduction and improvement of time-of-flight scanners and increasing the axial length of the PET detector arrays have more than doubled the sensitivity of the PET part of the system. MRI for attenuation correction has provided many potential pitfalls, including misclassification of tissue classes based on MRI information for attenuation correction. Although the use of short echo times have helped to address these pitfalls, one of the most exciting developments has been the use of deep learning algorithms and computational neural networks to rapidly provide soft tissue, fat, bone and air information for the attenuation correction as a supplement to the attenuation correction information from fat-water imaging. Challenges with motion correction, particularly respiratory and cardiac remain but are being addressed with respiratory monitors and using PET data. In order to address truncation artefacts, the system manufacturers have developed methods to extend the MR field-of-view for the purpose of the attenuation and scatter corrections. General pitfalls like stitching of body sections for individual studies, optimum delivery of images for viewing and reporting, and resource implications for the sheer volume of data generated remain Methods to overcome these pitfalls serve as a strong foundation for the future of PET/MRI. Advances in the underlying technology with significant evolution in hard-ware and software and the exiting developments in use of deep learning algorithms and computational neural networks will drive the next decade of PET/MRI imaging.

JOURNAL: Nuclear medicine communications

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Background: The study aimed to evaluate the beta penalization factor of the BSREM reconstruction algorithm on a five-ring BGO-based PET CT system and compared it with conventional reconstructions.

Methods: Retrospective study involves 30 breast cancer patient data of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose ( 18 F-FDG) PET CT for reconstruction with OSEM, OSEM + PSF, and BSREM under variable β factors ranging from 200 to 600 in the steps of 50. Liver noise, lesion SUVmax, SBR, and SNR for each reconstruction were calculated. Quantitative parameters of each beta factor of BSREM were compared with OSEM and OSEM + PSF, using the Wilcoxon sign rank test with Bonferroni correction, a value of P < 0.002 was considered statistically significant. Visual scoring by two readers was also evaluated.

Results: Thirty lesions of mean size 1.91 ± 0.58 cm range (0.7-3.6 cm) were identified. Liver noise and SBR were reduced, whereas SNR was increased with an increasing β value of BSREM. In comparison with OSEM, liver noise was not significantly different from β200 and β250. SNR of OSEM was significantly lower than any other β factors and SBR of β factor less than 500 was significantly higher than OSEM. In comparison with OSEM + PSF, liver noise was not significantly different from β400 and β350-500 do not show a significant difference in SNR and SBR compared with OSEM + PSF. β350 scored highest under visual scoring with a moderate agreement.

Conclusion: The study quantitatively indicates the optimum beta range of β250-450 and the qualitative evaluation indicates that β350 is an optimum beta factor of BSREM in breast cancer cases for 18 F-FDG WB-PET CT.

JOURNAL: NeuroImage

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Accurate regional brain quantitative PET measurements, particularly when using partial volume correction, rely on robust image registration between PET and MR images. We argue here that the precision, and hence the uncertainty, of MR-PET image registration is mainly driven by the registration implementation and the quality of PET images due to their lower resolution and higher noise compared to the structural MR images. We propose a dedicated uncertainty analysis for quantifying the precision of MR-PET registration, centred around the bootstrap resampling of PET list-mode events to generate multiple PET image realisations with different noise (count) levels. The effects of PET image reconstruction parameters, such as the use of attenuation and scatter corrections and different number of iterations, on the precision and accuracy of MR-PET registration were investigated. In addition, the performance of four software packages with their default settings for rigid inter-modality image registration were considered: NiftyReg, Vinci, FSL and SPM. Four distinct PET image distributions made of two early time frames (similar to cortical FDG) and two late frames using two amyloid PET dynamic acquisitions of one amyloid positive and one amyloid negative participants were investigated. For the investigated four PET frames, the biggest impact on the uncertainty was observed between registration software packages (up to 10-fold difference in precision) followed by the reconstruction parameters. On average, the lowest uncertainty for different PET frames and brain regions was observed with SPM and two iterations of fully quantitative image reconstruction. The observed uncertainty for the varying PET count-level (from 5% to 60%) was slightly lower than for the reconstruction parameters. We also observed that the registration uncertainty in quantitative PET analysis depends on amyloid status of the considered PET frames, with increased uncertainty (up to three times) when using post-reconstruction partial volume correction. This analysis is applicable for PET data obtained from either PET/MR or PET/CT scanners.

TITLE: Short-axis PET image quality improvement based on a uEXPLORER total-body PET system through deep learning

AUTHORS: Zhenxing Huang, Wenbo Li, Yaping Wu, Nannan Guo, Lin Yang, Na Zhang, Zhifeng Pang, Yongfeng Yang, Yun Zhou, Yue Shang, Hairong Zheng, Dong Liang, Meiyun Wang, Zhanli Hu

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: The axial field of view (AFOV) of a positron emission tomography (PET) scanner greatly affects the quality of PET images. Although a total-body PET scanner (uEXPLORER) with a large AFOV is more sensitive, it is more expensive and difficult to widely use. Therefore, we attempt to utilize high-quality images generated by uEXPLORER to optimize the quality of images from short-axis PET scanners through deep learning technology while controlling costs.

Methods: The experiments were conducted using PET images of three anatomical locations (brain, lung, and abdomen) from 335 patients. To simulate PET images from different axes, two protocols were used to obtain PET image pairs (each patient was scanned once). For low-quality PET (LQ-PET) images with a 320-mm AFOV, we applied a 300-mm FOV for brain reconstruction and a 500-mm FOV for lung and abdomen reconstruction. For high-quality PET (HQ-PET) images, we applied a 1940-mm AFOV during the reconstruction process. A 3D Unet was utilized to learn the mapping relationship between LQ-PET and HQ-PET images. In addition, the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index measure (SSIM) were employed to evaluate the model performance. Furthermore, two nuclear medicine doctors evaluated the image quality based on clinical readings.

Results: The generated PET images of the brain, lung, and abdomen were quantitatively and qualitatively compatible with the HQ-PET images. In particular, our method achieved PSNR values of 35.41 ± 5.45 dB (p < 0.05), 33.77 ± 6.18 dB (p < 0.05), and 38.58 ± 7.28 dB (p < 0.05) for the three beds. The overall mean SSIM was greater than 0.94 for all patients who underwent testing. Moreover, the total subjective quality levels of the generated PET images for three beds were 3.74 ± 0.74, 3.69 ± 0.81, and 3.42 ± 0.99 (the highest possible score was 5, and the minimum score was 1) from two experienced nuclear medicine experts. Additionally, we evaluated the distribution of quantitative standard uptake values (SUV) in the region of interest (ROI). Both the SUV distribution and the peaks of the profile show that our results are consistent with the HQ-PET images, proving the superiority of our approach.

Conclusion: The findings demonstrate the potential of the proposed technique for improving the image quality of a PET scanner with a 320 mm or even shorter AFOV. Furthermore, this study explored the potential of utilizing uEXPLORER to achieve improved short-axis PET image quality at a limited economic cost, and computer-aided diagnosis systems that are related can help patients and radiologists.

TITLE: Similarity-Driven Fine-Tuning Methods for Regularization Parameter Optimization in PET Image Reconstruction

AUTHORS: Wen Zhu, Soo-Jin Lee

JOURNAL: Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
We present an adaptive method for fine-tuning hyperparameters in edge-preserving regularization for PET image reconstruction. For edge-preserving regularization, in addition to the smoothing parameter that balances data fidelity and regularization, one or more control parameters are typically incorporated to adjust the sensitivity of edge preservation by modifying the shape of the penalty function. Although there have been efforts to develop automated methods for tuning the hyperparameters in regularized PET reconstruction, the majority of these methods primarily focus on the smoothing parameter. However, it is challenging to obtain high-quality images without appropriately selecting the control parameters that adjust the edge preservation sensitivity. In this work, we propose a method to precisely tune the hyperparameters, which are initially set with a fixed value for the entire image, either manually or using an automated approach. Our core strategy involves adaptively adjusting the control parameter at each pixel, taking into account the degree of patch similarities calculated from the previous iteration within the pixel's neighborhood that is being updated. This approach allows our new method to integrate with a wide range of existing parameter-tuning techniques for edge-preserving regularization. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method effectively enhances the overall reconstruction accuracy across multiple image quality metrics, including peak signal-to-noise ratio, structural similarity, visual information fidelity, mean absolute error, root-mean-square error, and mean percentage error.

JOURNAL: IEEE transactions on medical imaging

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Penalised PET image reconstruction algorithms are often accelerated during early iterations with the use of subsets. However, these methods may exhibit limit cycle behaviour at later iterations due to variations between subsets. Desirable converged images can be achieved for a subclass of these algorithms via the implementation of a relaxed step size sequence, but the heuristic selection of parameters will impact the quality of the image sequence and algorithm convergence rates. In this work, we demonstrate the adaption and application of a class of stochastic variance reduction gradient algorithms for PET image reconstruction using the relative difference penalty and numerically compare convergence performance to BSREM. The two investigated algorithms are: SAGA and SVRG. These algorithms require the retention in memory of recently computed subset gradients, which are utilised in subsequent updates. We present several numerical studies based on Monte Carlo simulated data and a patient data set for fully 3D PET acquisitions. The impact of the number of subsets, different preconditioners and step size methods on the convergence of regions of interest values within the reconstructed images is explored. We observe that when using constant preconditioning, SAGA and SVRG demonstrate reduced variations in voxel values between subsequent updates and are less reliant on step size hyper-parameter selection than BSREM reconstructions. Furthermore, SAGA and SVRG can converge significantly faster to the penalised maximum likelihood solution than BSREM, particularly in low count data.

TITLE: Delayed PET imaging using image synthesis network and nonrigid registration without additional CT scan

AUTHORS: Fan Rao, Zhuoxuan Wu, Lu Han, Bao Yang, Weidong Han, Wentao Zhu

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Attenuation correction is critical for positron emission tomography (PET) image reconstruction. The standard protocol for obtaining attenuation information in a clinical PET scanner is via coregistered computed tomography (CT) images. Therefore, for delayed PET imaging, the CT scan is repeated twice, which increases the radiation dose for the patient. In this paper, we propose a zero-extradose delayed PET imaging method that requires no additional CT scans.

Methods: A deep learning-based synthesis network is designed to convert PET data into pseudo-CT images for delayed scans. Then, nonrigid registration is performed between this pseudo CT image and the CT image of the first scan, warping the CT image of the first scan to an estimated CT image for the delayed scan. Finally, the PET image attenuation correction in the delayed scan is obtained from this estimated CT image. Experiments with clinical datasets are implemented to assess the effectiveness of the proposed method with the well-recognized Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) method. The average peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and the mean absolute percent error (MAPE) are used for comparison. We also use scoring from three experienced radiologists as subjective measurement means based on the diagnostic consistency of the PET images reconstructed from GAN and the proposed method with respect to the ground truth images.

Results: The experiments show that the average PSNR is 47.04 dB (the proposed method) vs. 44.41 dB (the traditional GAN method) for the reconstructed delayed PET images in our evaluation dataset. The average MAPEs are 1.59% for the proposed method and 3.32% for the traditional GAN method across five organ regions of interest (ROIs). The scores for the GAN and the proposed method rated by three experienced radiologists are 8.08±0.60 and 9.02±0.52, indicating that the proposed method yields more consistent PET images with the ground truth.

Conclusions: This work proposes a novel method for CT-less delayed PET imaging based on image synthesis network and nonrigid image registration. The PET image reconstructed using the proposed method yields delayed PET images with high image quality without artifacts and is quantitatively more accurate than the traditional GAN method.

TITLE: GapFill-Recon Net: A Cascade Network for simultaneously PET Gap Filling and Image Reconstruction

AUTHORS: Yanchao Huang, Huobiao Zhu, Xiaoman Duan, Xiaotong Hong, Hao Sun, Wenbing Lv, Lijun Lu, Qianjin Feng

JOURNAL: Computer methods and programs in biomedicine

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
PET image reconstruction from incomplete data, such as the gap between adjacent detector blocks generally introduces partial projection data loss, is an important and challenging problem in medical imaging. This work proposes an efficient convolutional neural network (CNN) framework, called GapFill-Recon Net, that jointly reconstructs PET images and their associated sinogram data. GapFill-Recon Net including two blocks: the Gap-Filling block first address the sinogram gap and the Image-Recon block maps the filled sinogram onto the final image directly. A total of 43,660 pairs of synthetic 2D PET sinograms with gaps and images generated from the MOBY phantom are utilized for network training, testing and validation. Whole-body mouse Monte Carlo (MC) simulated data are also used for evaluation. The experimental results show that the reconstructed image quality of GapFill-Recon Net outperforms filtered back-projection (FBP) and maximum likelihood expectation maximization (MLEM) in terms of the structural similarity index metric (SSIM), relative root mean squared error (rRMSE), and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). Moreover, the reconstruction speed is equivalent to that of FBP and was nearly 83 times faster than that of MLEM. In conclusion, compared with the traditional reconstruction algorithm, GapFill-Recon Net achieves relatively optimal performance in image quality and reconstruction speed, which effectively achieves a balance between efficiency and performance.

TITLE: Short-Axis PET Image Quality Improvement by Attention CycleGAN Using Total-Body PET

AUTHORS: Chong Shang, Guohua Zhao, Yamei Li, Jianmin Yuan, Meiyun Wang, Yaping Wu, Yusong Lin

JOURNAL: Journal of healthcare engineering

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
The quality of positron emission tomography (PET) imaging is positively correlated with scanner sensitivity, which is closely related to the axial field of view (FOV). Conventional short-axis PET scanners (200-350 mm FOV) reduce the imaging quality during fast scanning (2-3 minutes) due to the limitation of FOV, which reduce the reliability of diagnosis. To overcome hardware limitations and improve the image quality of short-axis PET scanners, we propose a supervised deep learning model, CycleAGAN, which is based on a cycle-consistent adversarial network (CycleGAN). We introduced the attention mechanism into the generator and focus on channel and spatial representative features and supervised learning using pairs of data to maintain the spatial consistency of the generated images with the ground truth. The imaging information of 386 patients from Henan Provincial People's Hospital was prospectively included as the dataset in this study. The training data come from the total-body PET scanner uEXPLORER. The proposed CycleAGAN is compared with traditional gray-level-based methods and learning-based methods. The results confirm that CycleAGAN achieved the best results on SSIM and NRMSE and achieved the closest distribution to ground truth in expert rating. The proposed method is not only able to improve the image quality of PET scanners with 320 mm FOV but also achieved good results on shorter FOV scanners. Patients and radiologists can benefit from the computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system integrated with CycleAGAN.

ABSTRACT:
The classical intent of PET imaging is to obtain the most accurate estimate of the amount of positron-emitting radiotracer in the smallest possible volume element located anywhere in the imaging subject at any time using the least amount of radioactivity. Reaching this goal, however, is confounded by an enormous array of interlinked technical issues that limit imaging system performance. As a result, advances in PET, human or animal, are the result of cumulative innovations across each of the component elements of PET, from data acquisition to image analysis. In the report that follows, we trace several of these advances across the imaging process with a focus on small animal PET.

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Nuclear medicine imaging modalities such as PET and SPECT are confounded by high noise levels and low spatial resolution, necessitating postreconstruction image enhancement to improve their quality and quantitative accuracy. Artificial intelligence (AI) models such as convolutional neural networks, U-Nets, and generative adversarial networks have shown promising outcomes in enhancing PET and SPECT images. This review article presents a comprehensive survey of state-of-the-art AI methods for PET and SPECT image enhancement and seeks to identify emerging trends in this field. We focus on recent breakthroughs in AI-based PET and SPECT image denoising and deblurring. Supervised deep-learning models have shown great potential in reducing radiotracer dose and scan times without sacrificing image quality and diagnostic accuracy. However, the clinical utility of these methods is often limited by their need for paired clean and corrupt datasets for training. This has motivated research into unsupervised alternatives that can overcome this limitation by relying on only corrupt inputs or unpaired datasets to train models. This review highlights recently published supervised and unsupervised efforts toward AI-based PET and SPECT image enhancement. We discuss cross-scanner and cross-protocol training efforts, which can greatly enhance the clinical translatability of AI-based image enhancement tools. We also aim to address the looming question of whether the improvements in image quality generated by AI models lead to actual clinical benefit. To this end, we discuss works that have focused on task-specific objective clinical evaluation of AI models for image enhancement or incorporated clinical metrics into their loss functions to guide the image generation process. Finally, we discuss emerging research directions, which include the exploration of novel training paradigms, curation of larger task-specific datasets, and objective clinical evaluation that will enable the realization of the full translation potential of these models in the future.

TITLE: Unsupervised PET logan parametric image estimation using conditional deep image prior

AUTHORS: Jianan Cui, Kuang Gong, Ning Guo, Kyungsang Kim, Huafeng Liu, Quanzheng Li

JOURNAL: Medical image analysis

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Recently, deep learning-based denoising methods have been gradually used for PET images denoising and have shown great achievements. Among these methods, one interesting framework is conditional deep image prior (CDIP) which is an unsupervised method that does not need prior training or a large number of training pairs. In this work, we combined CDIP with Logan parametric image estimation to generate high-quality parametric images. In our method, the kinetic model is the Logan reference tissue model that can avoid arterial sampling. The neural network was utilized to represent the images of Logan slope and intercept. The patient's computed tomography (CT) image or magnetic resonance (MR) image was used as the network input to provide anatomical information. The optimization function was constructed and solved by the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm. Both simulation and clinical patient datasets demonstrated that the proposed method could generate parametric images with more detailed structures. Quantification results showed that the proposed method results had higher contrast-to-noise (CNR) improvement ratios (PET/CT datasets: 62.25%±29.93%; striatum of brain PET datasets : 129.51%±32.13%, thalamus of brain PET datasets: 128.24%±31.18%) than Gaussian filtered results (PET/CT datasets: 23.33%±18.63%; striatum of brain PET datasets: 74.71%±8.71%, thalamus of brain PET datasets: 73.02%±9.34%) and nonlocal mean (NLM) denoised results (PET/CT datasets: 37.55%±26.56%; striatum of brain PET datasets: 100.89%±16.13%, thalamus of brain PET datasets: 103.59%±16.37%).

ABSTRACT:
This article reviews the current evolution and future directions in PET/CT technology focusing on three areas: time of flight, image reconstruction, and data-driven gating. Image reconstruction is considered with advances in point spread function modelling, Bayesian penalised likelihood reconstruction, and artificial intelligence approaches. Data-driven gating is examined with reference to respiratory motion, cardiac motion, and head motion. For each of these technological advancements, theory will be briefly discussed, benefits of their use in routine practice will be detailed and potential future developments will be discussed. Representative clinical cases will be presented, demonstrating the huge opportunities given to the PET community by hardware and software advances in PET technology when it comes to lesion detection, disease characterization, accurate quantitation and quicker scans. Through this review, hospitals are encouraged to embrace, evaluate and appropriately implement the wide range of new PET technologies that are available now or in the near future, for the improvement of patient care.

TITLE: Influence of image reconstruction on quantitative cardiac 15O-water positron emission tomography

AUTHORS: Jonny Nordström, Elin Lindström, Tanja Kero, Jens Sörensen, Mark Lubberink

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear cardiology : official publication of the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Background: The impact on quantitative15O-water PET/CT of a wide range of different reconstruction settings, including regularized reconstruction by block-sequential regularized expectation maximization (BSREM), was investigated.

Methods: Twenty clinical stress scans from patients referred for assessment of myocardial ischemia were included. Patients underwent a 4-min dynamic stress PET scan with15O-water on a digital PET/CT scanner. Twenty-two reconstructions were generated from each scan and a clinical reconstruction was used as reference. Varied parameters were number of iterations, filter, exclusion of time-of-flight and point-spread function, and regularization parameter with BSREM. Analyses were performed in aQuant utilizing two different methods and resulting regional myocardial blood flow (MBF), perfusable tissue fraction (PTF), and transmural MBF (MBFt) values were evaluated.

Results: Across the two analyses, correlations toward the reference reconstruction were strong for all parameters (ρ ≥ 0.83). Using automated analysis and the diagnostic threshold of hyperemic MBF at 2.3 mL⋅g-1⋅min-1, diagnosis was unchanged irrespective of reconstruction method in all patients except for one, where only four of the most extreme reconstruction methods resulted in a change of diagnosis.

Conclusion: The low sensitivity of MBF values to reconstruction method and, as previously shown, scanner type and PET/CT misalignment, confirms that diagnostic hyperemic MBF cutoff values can be consistently used for15O-water.

AUTHORS: F Lamare, A Bousse, K Thielemans, C Liu, T Merlin, H Fayad, D Visvikis

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Positron emission tomography (PET) respiratory motion correction has been a subject of great interest for the last twenty years, prompted mainly by the development of multimodality imaging devices such as PET/computed tomography (CT) and PET/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). PET respiratory motion correction involves a number of steps including acquisition synchronization, motion estimation and finally motion correction. The synchronization steps include the use of different external device systems or data driven approaches which have been gaining ground over the last few years. Patient specific or generic motion models using the respiratory synchronized datasets can be subsequently derived and used for correction either in the image space or within the image reconstruction process. Similar overall approaches can be considered and have been proposed for both PET/CT and PET/MRI devices. Certain variations in the case of PET/MRI include the use of MRI specific sequences for the registration of respiratory motion information. The proposed review includes a comprehensive coverage of all these areas of development in field of PET respiratory motion for different multimodality imaging devices and approaches in terms of synchronization, estimation and subsequent motion correction. Finally, a section on perspectives including the potential clinical usage of these approaches is included.

TITLE: PET image denoising based on denoising diffusion probabilistic model

AUTHORS: Kuang Gong, Keith Johnson, Georges El Fakhri, Quanzheng Li, Tinsu Pan

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Due to various physical degradation factors and limited counts received, PET image quality needs further improvements. The denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) was a distribution learning-based model, which tried to transform a normal distribution into a specific data distribution based on iterative refinements. In this work, we proposed and evaluated different DDPM-based methods for PET image denoising.

Methods: Under the DDPM framework, one way to perform PET image denoising was to provide the PET image and/or the prior image as the input. Another way was to supply the prior image as the network input with the PET image included in the refinement steps, which could fit for scenarios of different noise levels. 150 brain [[Formula: see text]F]FDG datasets and 140 brain [[Formula: see text]F]MK-6240 (imaging neurofibrillary tangles deposition) datasets were utilized to evaluate the proposed DDPM-based methods.

Results: Quantification showed that the DDPM-based frameworks with PET information included generated better results than the nonlocal mean, Unet and generative adversarial network (GAN)-based denoising methods. Adding additional MR prior in the model helped achieved better performance and further reduced the uncertainty during image denoising. Solely relying on MR prior while ignoring the PET information resulted in large bias. Regional and surface quantification showed that employing MR prior as the network input while embedding PET image as a data-consistency constraint during inference achieved the best performance.

Conclusion: DDPM-based PET image denoising is a flexible framework, which can efficiently utilize prior information and achieve better performance than the nonlocal mean, Unet and GAN-based denoising methods.

TITLE: Optimizing time-of-flight of PET/CT image quality via penalty β value in Bayesian penalized likelihood reconstruction algorithm

AUTHORS: H Murat, M A A Zulkifli, M A Said, M Awang Kechik, D Tahir, M K Abdul Karim

JOURNAL: Radiography (London, England : 1995)

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Introduction: Optimizing the image quality of Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (PET/CT) systems is crucial for effective monitoring, diagnosis, and treatment planning in oncology. This study evaluates the impact of time-of-flight (TOF) on PET/CT performance, focusing on varying penalty β values within Q. Clear reconstruction algorithm.

Methods: The study measured signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) using the Discovery MI PET/CT scanner and NEMA IQ phantom filled with the radiotracer fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG). PET/CT scans were performed with and without TOF using β values of 100, 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, and 3000. Pixel intensity values were measured using ImageJ software, and SNR and CNR were calculated.

Results: Results indicated that increasing β values improved SNR and CNR for both non-TOF and TOF images. At a β value of 100, SNR and CNR increased across all sphere sizes (10 mm, 13 mm, 17 mm, 22 mm, 28 mm, 37 mm) when comparing non-TOF and TOF images. However, β values of 500 or higher led to decreased SNR and CNR, particularly in larger spheres (22 mm, 28 mm, 37 mm), when TOF was utilized.

Conclusion: These findings underscore the importance of optimizing β values and employing TOF reconstruction in PET/CT scans to achieve the highest possible image quality.

Implications for practice: In clinical practice, practitioners should adjust β values in accordance with routine protocols, considering the size of the target region and the use of TOF reconstruction.

ABSTRACT:
Artificial intelligence (AI) has been applied to various medical imaging tasks, such as computer-aided diagnosis. Specifically, deep learning techniques such as convolutional neural network (CNN) and generative adversarial network (GAN) have been extensively used for medical image generation. Image generation with deep learning has been investigated in studies using positron emission tomography (PET). This article reviews studies that applied deep learning techniques for image generation on PET. We categorized the studies for PET image generation with deep learning into three themes as follows: (1) recovering full PET data from noisy data by denoising with deep learning, (2) PET image reconstruction and attenuation correction with deep learning and (3) PET image translation and synthesis with deep learning. We introduce recent studies based on these three categories. Finally, we mention the limitations of applying deep learning techniques to PET image generation and future prospects for PET image generation.

TITLE: ML-EM based dual tracer PET image reconstruction with inclusion of prompt gamma attenuation

AUTHORS: Elisabeth Pfaehler, Debora Niekämper, Jürgen Scheins, N Jon Shah, Christoph W Lerche

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Objective.Conventionally, if two metabolic processes are of interest for image analysis, two separate, sequential positron emission tomography (PET) scans are performed. However, sequential PET scans cannot simultaneously display the metabolic targets. The concurrent study of two simultaneous PET scans could provide new insights into the causes of diseases.Approach.In this work, we propose a reconstruction algorithm for the simultaneous injection of aβ+-emitter emitting only annihilation photons and aβ+-γ-emitter emitting annihilation photons and an additional promptγ-photon. As in previous works, theγ-photon is used to identify events originating from theβ+-γ-emitter. However, due to e.g. attenuation and down-scatter, theγ-photon is often not detected and not all events can correctly be associated with theβ+-γ-emitter as they are detected as double coincidences. In contrast to previous works, we estimate this number of double coincidences with origin in theβ+-γ, emitter including the attenuation of the promptγ, and incorporate this estimation in the forward-projection of the maximum likelihood expectation maximization algorithm. For evaluation, we simulate different scenarios with varying objects and attenuation maps. The nuclide18F serves asβ+-emitter, while44Sc functions asβ+-γemitter. The performance of the algorithm is assessed by calculating the residual error of theβ+-γ-emitter in the reconstructedβ+-emitter image. Additionally, the intensity values in the simulated cylinders of the ground truth (GT) and the reconstructed images are compared.Main results.The remaining activity in theβ+-emitter image varied from 0.4% to 3.7%. The absolute percentage difference between GT and reconstructed intensity for the pureβ+emitter images was found to be between 3.0% and 7.4% for all cases. The absolute percentage difference between the GT and the reconstructed intensity for theβ+-γemitter images ranged from 8.7% to 10.4% for all simulated cases.Significance.These results demonstrate that our approach can reconstruct two separate images with a good quantitation accuracy.

TITLE: Image reconstruction using small-voxel size improves small lesion detection for positron emission tomography

AUTHORS: Sebastijan Rep, Petra Tomse, Luka Jensterle, Leon Jarabek, Katja Zaletel, Luka Lezaic

JOURNAL: Radiology and oncology

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Background: PET/CT imaging is widely used in oncology and provides both metabolic and anatomic information. Because of the relatively poor spatial resolution of PET, the detection of small lesions is limited. The low spatial resolution introduces the partial-volume effect (PVE) which negatively affects images both qualitatively and quantitatively. The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of small-voxel (2 mm in-line pixel size)vs.standard-voxel (4 mm in-line pixel size) reconstruction on lesion detection and image quality in a range of activity ratios.

Materials and methods: The National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) body phantom and the Micro Hollow-Sphere phantom spheres were filled with a solution of [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]FDG) in sphere-to-background ratios of 2:1, 3:1, 4:1 and 8:1. In all images reconstructed with 2 mm and 4 mm in-line pixel size the visual lesion delineation, contrast recovery coefficient (CRC) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) were evaluated.

Results: For smaller (≤ 13 mm) phantom spheres, significantly higher CRC and CNR using small-voxel reconstructions were found, also improving visual lesion delineation. CRC did not differ significantly for larger (≥ 17 mm) spheres using 2 mm and 4 mm in-line pixel size, but CNR was significantly lower; however, lower CNR did not affect visual lesion delineation.

Conclusions: Small-voxel reconstruction consistently improves precise small lesion delineation, lesion contrast and image quality.

AUTHORS: Qian Wang, Yasser G Abdelhafez, Hande Nalbant, Benjamin A Spencer, Reimund Bayerlein, Jinyi Qi, Simon R Cherry, Lorenzo Nardo, Ramsey D Badawi

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Objective.Penalty parameters in penalized likelihood positron emission tomography (PET) reconstruction are typically determined empirically. The cross-validation log-likelihood (CVLL) method has been introduced to optimize these parameters by maximizing a CVLL function, which assesses the likelihood of reconstructed images using one subset of a list-mode dataset based on another subset. This study aims to validate the efficacy of the CVLL method in whole-body imaging for cancer patients using a conventional clinical PET scanner.Approach.Fifteen lung cancer patients were injected with 243.7 ± 23.8 MBq of [18F]FDG and underwent a 22 min PET scan on a Biograph mCT PET/CT scanner, starting at 60 ± 5 min post-injection. The PET list-mode data were partitioned by subsampling without replacement, with 20 minutes of data for image reconstruction using an in-house ordered subset expectation maximization algorithm and the remaining 2 minutes of data for cross-validation. Two penalty parameters, penalty strengthβand Fair penalty function parameterδ, were subjected to optimization. Whole-body images were reconstructed, and CVLL values were computed across various penalty parameter combinations. The optimal image corresponding to the maximum CVLL value was selected by a grid search for each patient.Main results.Theδvalue required to maximize the CVLL value was notably small (⩽10-6in this study). The influences of voxel size and scan duration on image optimization were investigated. A correlation analysis revealed a significant inverse relationship between optimalβand scan count level, with a correlation coefficient of -0.68 (p-value = 3.5 × 10-5). The optimal images selected by the CVLL method were compared with those chosen by two radiologists based on their diagnostic preferences. Differences were observed in the selection of optimal images.Significance.This study demonstrates the feasibility of incorporating the CVLL method into routine imaging protocols, potentially allowing for a wide range of combinations of injected radioactivity amounts and scan durations in modern PET imaging.

JOURNAL: Clinical nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Medical imaging artifacts compromise image quality and quantitative analysis and might confound interpretation and misguide clinical decision-making. The present work envisions and demonstrates a new paradigm PET image Quality Assurance NETwork (PET-QA-NET) in which various image artifacts are detected and disentangled from images without prior knowledge of a standard of reference or ground truth for routine PET image quality assurance.

Methods: The network was trained and evaluated using training/validation/testing data sets consisting of 669/100/100 artifact-free oncological 18 F-FDG PET/CT images and subsequently fine-tuned and evaluated on 384 (20% for fine-tuning) scans from 8 different PET centers. The developed DL model was quantitatively assessed using various image quality metrics calculated for 22 volumes of interest defined on each scan. In addition, 200 additional 18 F-FDG PET/CT scans (this time with artifacts), generated using both CT-based attenuation and scatter correction (routine PET) and PET-QA-NET, were blindly evaluated by 2 nuclear medicine physicians for the presence of artifacts, diagnostic confidence, image quality, and the number of lesions detected in different body regions.

Results: Across the volumes of interest of 100 patients, SUV MAE values of 0.13 ± 0.04, 0.24 ± 0.1, and 0.21 ± 0.06 were reached for SUV mean , SUV max , and SUV peak , respectively (no statistically significant difference). Qualitative assessment showed a general trend of improved image quality and diagnostic confidence and reduced image artifacts for PET-QA-NET compared with routine CT-based attenuation and scatter correction.

Conclusion: We developed a highly effective and reliable quality assurance tool that can be embedded routinely to detect and correct for 18 F-FDG PET image artifacts in clinical setting with notably improved PET image quality and quantitative capabilities.

ABSTRACT:
Background and objective: Generalizable and trustworthy deep learning models for PET/CT image segmentation necessitates large diverse multi-institutional datasets. However, legal, ethical, and patient privacy issues challenge sharing of datasets between different centers. To overcome these challenges, we developed a federated learning (FL) framework for multi-institutional PET/CT image segmentation.

Methods: A dataset consisting of 328 FL (HN) cancer patients who underwent clinical PET/CT examinations gathered from six different centers was enrolled. A pure transformer network was implemented as fully core segmentation algorithms using dual channel PET/CT images. We evaluated different frameworks (single center-based, centralized baseline, as well as seven different FL algorithms) using 68 PET/CT images (20% of each center data). In particular, the implemented FL algorithms include clipping with the quantile estimator (ClQu), zeroing with the quantile estimator (ZeQu), federated averaging (FedAvg), lossy compression (LoCo), robust aggregation (RoAg), secure aggregation (SeAg), and Gaussian differentially private FedAvg with adaptive quantile clipping (GDP-AQuCl).

Results: The Dice coefficient was 0.80±0.11 for both centralized and SeAg FL algorithms. All FL approaches achieved centralized learning model performance with no statistically significant differences. Among the FL algorithms, SeAg and GDP-AQuCl performed better than the other techniques. However, there was no statistically significant difference. All algorithms, except the center-based approach, resulted in relative errors less than 5% for SUVmaxand SUVmeanfor all FL and centralized methods. Centralized and FL algorithms significantly outperformed the single center-based baseline.

Conclusions: The developed FL-based (with centralized method performance) algorithms exhibited promising performance for HN tumor segmentation from PET/CT images.

ABSTRACT:
Introduction: Q.Clear is a Bayesian penalised-likelihood algorithm that uses a β-value for positron emission tomography(PET)/computed tomography(CT) image reconstruction(IR). Our study proposes a novel figure of merit, named CRBV, to compare the Q.Clear performances using68Ga PET/CT image with the ordered-subset-expectation-maximization(OSEM) algorithm and to identify the optimal β-values for these images using two phantoms mimicking normal and overweight patients.

Methods: NEMA IQ phantom with or without a ring of water-filled plastic bags (NEMAstdand NEMAow, respectively) was acquired and reconstructed with OSEM and Q.Clear at various β-values and minutes/bed position(min/bp). Contrast recovery(CR), background variability(BV) and CRBV were calculated. Highest CRBV values were used to identify optimal β-value ranges.

Results: Q.Clear with 250 ≤ β ≤ 800 improved CRBV compared to OSEM for all the investigated spheres and acquisition setups. Outside of this range, Q.Clear still outperformed OSEM with few exceptions depending on spheres diameters and phantoms(e.g.,β-value = 1600 for diameters ≤ 17 mm using the NEMAowphantom). Regarding the CRBV performance for IR optimization, for the 4 min/bp NEMAstdIR, β-values = 300 ÷ 350 allowed to simultaneously optimize all diameters(except for the 10 mm); for the NEMAowIR, β-values = 350 ÷ 500 were needed for diameters > 20 mm, while β-values = 200 ÷ 250 were selected for the remaining diameters. For the 2 min/bp, β-value = 500 was suitable for diameters > 17 mm in both NEMAstdand NEMAowIR, while for smaller diameters β-value = 200 and β-values = 250 ÷ 350 were obtained for NEMAstdand NEMAow, respectively.

Conclusion: Almost all tested β-values of Q.Clear improved the CRBV compared to OSEM. In both phantoms, simulating normal and over-weight patients, optimal β-values were found according to lesion sizes and investigated acquisition times.

TITLE: 4D deep image prior: dynamic PET image denoising using an unsupervised four-dimensional branch convolutional neural network

AUTHORS: Fumio Hashimoto, Hiroyuki Ohba, Kibo Ote, Akihiro Kakimoto, Hideo Tsukada, Yasuomi Ouchi

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Although convolutional neural networks (CNNs) demonstrate the superior performance in denoising positron emission tomography (PET) images, a supervised training of the CNN requires a pair of large, high-quality PET image datasets. As an unsupervised learning method, a deep image prior (DIP) has recently been proposed; it can perform denoising with only the target image. In this study, we propose an innovative procedure for the DIP approach with a four-dimensional (4D) branch CNN architecture in end-to-end training to denoise dynamic PET images. Our proposed 4D CNN architecture can be applied to end-to-end dynamic PET image denoising by introducing a feature extractor and a reconstruction branch for each time frame of the dynamic PET image. In the proposed DIP method, it is not necessary to prepare high-quality and large patient-related PET images. Instead, a subject's own static PET image is used as additional information, dynamic PET images are treated as training labels, and denoised dynamic PET images are obtained from the CNN outputs. Both simulation with [18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) and preclinical data with [18F]FDG and [11C]raclopride were used to evaluate the proposed framework. The results showed that our 4D DIP framework quantitatively and qualitatively outperformed 3D DIP and other unsupervised denoising methods. The proposed 4D DIP framework thus provides a promising procedure for dynamic PET image denoising.

TITLE: Optimal relaxation parameters of dynamic row-action maximum likelihood algorithm and post-smoothing filter for image reconstruction of dedicated breast PET

AUTHORS: Yoko Satoh, Masamichi Imai, Kenji Hirata, Yuzo Asakawa, Chihiro Ikegawa, Hiroshi Onishi

JOURNAL: Annals of nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Objective: This study aimed to determine the optimal β value of the relaxation control parameter and the post-smoothing filter in the list-mode dynamic row-action maximum likelihood algorithm (LM-DRAMA) to detect early stage breast cancer with high-resolution dedicated breast positron emission tomography (dbPET) in phantom and clinical studies.

Methods: A breast phantom containing four spheres (5, 7.5, 10, and 16 mm in diameter) was filled with18F-fluorodeoxyglucose solution (sphere-to-background ratio, 8:1) and scanned on a dbPET scanner. The images were reconstructed using LM-DRAMA with different β values (5, 20, or 100) and Gaussian post-filters (0, 0.78, 1.17, 1.56, 1.95, or 2.34 mm). Other conditions were according to those routinely used (1 iteration and 128 subsets including attenuation and scatter correction). Image quality was evaluated visually and by computing the coefficient of variation of the background (CVBG), detectability index (DI), and contrast recovery coefficient. Parameters optimized in these phantom studies were applied to 25 clinical data sets. Variabilities for different reconstruction methods in visual scores, the maximum standardized uptake value of breast cancer, and the tumor-to-background uptake ratio were estimated.

Results: The reconstruction images of the phantom with higher β values and smaller post-filters yielded higher visual scores for detectability and DI and lower smoothness and CVBGscores. Based on the phantom study, the β values and post-filter were optimized for clinical dbPET images except for β5 and 2.34 mm post-filter. Applying the other reconstructions to clinical studies showed that β100 provided higher quantitative parameter values. The detectability of lesions was similar for β100 and β20 and decreased with larger post-filters. The lesion detection rate was similar for β100 and β20 and decreased with larger post-filter.

Conclusion: The relaxation coefficient factor β20 and a 0.78- or 1.17-mm post-filter were optimal for dbPET image reconstruction with balanced spatial resolution and noise. However, they should be selected according to the impact on the dbPET image and the purpose of the examination.

JOURNAL: Computer methods and programs in biomedicine

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Background and objective: The Spline Reconstruction Technique (SRT) is a fast algorithm based on a novel numerical implementation of an analytic representation of the inverse Radon transform. The purpose of this study is to provide a comparison between SRT, Filtered Back-Projection (FBP), Ordered Subset Expectation Maximization 2D (2D-OSEM), and the Tera-Tomo 3D algorithm, using phantom data at various acquisition durations as well as small-animal data obtained from the Mediso nanoScan® PET/CT scanner.

Methods: For this purpose, the "NEMA NU 4-2008 standards" protocol was employed at five different realizations and acquisition durations. In addition to the image quality metrics described by the NEMA protocol, Cold Region Contrast was also considered as a figure-of-merit. Furthermore, Cold Region Contrast was measured in the myocardial infarction region of six male Wistar rats. The volumetric defect quantification was assessed with dedicated computer software. Lastly, plots of Recovery Coefficient and Spill-Over Ratio as a function of the Percentage Standard Deviation were generated, after smoothing the phantom reconstructions with four different Gaussian filters. Statistical significance was determined by employing the Kruskal-Wallis test or One-way Analysis of Variance depending on the normality of the variable's distribution.

Results: The present study revealed that, at the expense of slightly increased noise in the reconstructed images, SRT resulted in higher Recovery Coefficient values for small hot regions of interest, when compared with FBP and 2D-OSEM at all acquisition durations. Furthermore, SRT reconstructed images exhibit higher Recovery Coefficient values, for all hot regions of interest, when compared to the other 2D algorithms at short acquisition durations. In both phantom and animal studies, SRT achieved a significant improvement over 2D-OSEM for the Spill-Over Ratio and the Cold Region Contrast. These advantages were maintained even after comparing the algorithms at equal noise levels. The Tera-Tomo 3D algorithm (4 subsets, iterations≥ 13) performed significantly better compared to the other algorithms for all figures-of-merit. No statistically significant differences regarding the myocardial defect size were observed between the algorithms investigated.

Conclusions: Overall, SRT appears that could be useful for the quantification of small hot regions of interest, cold regions of interest, as well as in low-count imaging applications.

TITLE: Improved Low-Count Quantitative PET Reconstruction With an Iterative Neural Network

AUTHORS: Hongki Lim, Il Yong Chun, Yuni K Dewaraja, Jeffrey A Fessler

JOURNAL: IEEE transactions on medical imaging

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Image reconstruction in low-count PET is particularly challenging because gammas from natural radioactivity in Lu-based crystals cause high random fractions that lower the measurement signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR). In model-based image reconstruction (MBIR), using more iterations of an unregularized method may increase the noise, so incorporating regularization into the image reconstruction is desirable to control the noise. New regularization methods based on learned convolutional operators are emerging in MBIR. We modify the architecture of an iterative neural network, BCD-Net, for PET MBIR, and demonstrate the efficacy of the trained BCD-Net using XCAT phantom data that simulates the low true coincidence count-rates with high random fractions typical for Y-90 PET patient imaging after Y-90 microsphere radioembolization. Numerical results show that the proposed BCD-Net significantly improves CNR and RMSE of the reconstructed images compared to MBIR methods using non-trained regularizers, total variation (TV) and non-local means (NLM). Moreover, BCD-Net successfully generalizes to test data that differs from the training data. Improvements were also demonstrated for the clinically relevant phantom measurement data where we used training and testing datasets having very different activity distributions and count-levels.

ABSTRACT:
To evaluate whether a machine learning classifier can evaluate image quality of maximum intensity projection (MIP) images from F18-FDG-PET scans. A total of 400 MIP images from F18-FDG-PET with simulated decreasing acquisition time (120 s, 90 s, 60 s, 30 s and 15 s per bed-position) using block sequential regularized expectation maximization (BSREM) with a beta-value of 450 and 600 were created. A machine learning classifier was fed with 283 images rated "sufficient image quality" and 117 images rated "insufficient image quality". The classification performance of the machine learning classifier was assessed by calculating sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) using reader-based classification as the target. Classification performance of the machine learning classifier was AUC 0.978 for BSREM beta 450 and 0.967 for BSREM beta 600. The algorithm showed a sensitivity of 89% and 94% and a specificity of 94% and 94% for the reconstruction BSREM 450 and 600, respectively. Automated assessment of image quality from F18-FDG-PET images using a machine learning classifier provides equivalent performance to manual assessment by experienced radiologists.

TITLE: Semi-Supervised Standard-Dose PET Image Generation via Region-Adaptive Normalization and Structural Consistency Constraint

AUTHORS: Caiwen Jiang, Yongsheng Pan, Zhiming Cui, Dong Nie, Dinggang Shen

JOURNAL: IEEE transactions on medical imaging

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is an important nuclear medical imaging technique, and has been widely used in clinical applications, e.g., tumor detection and brain disease diagnosis. As PET imaging could put patients at risk of radiation, the acquisition of high-quality PET images with standard-dose tracers should be cautious. However, if dose is reduced in PET acquisition, the imaging quality could become worse and thus may not meet clinical requirement. To safely reduce the tracer dose and also maintain high quality of PET imaging, we propose a novel and effective approach to estimate high-quality Standard-dose PET (SPET) images from Low-dose PET (LPET) images. Specifically, to fully utilize both the rare paired and the abundant unpaired LPET and SPET images, we propose a semi-supervised framework for network training. Meanwhile, based on this framework, we further design a Region-adaptive Normalization (RN) and a structural consistency constraint to track the task-specific challenges. RN performs region-specific normalization in different regions of each PET image to suppress negative impact of large intensity variation across different regions, while the structural consistency constraint maintains structural details during the generation of SPET images from LPET images. Experiments on real human chest-abdomen PET images demonstrate that our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance quantitatively and qualitatively.

TITLE: Improved low-dose positron emission tomography image reconstruction using deep learned prior

AUTHORS: Xinhui Wang, Long Zhou, Yaofa Wang, Haochuan Jiang, Hongwei Ye

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Positron emission tomography (PET) is a promising medical imaging technology that provides non-invasive and quantitative measurement of biochemical process in the human bodies. PET image reconstruction is challenging due to the ill-poseness of the inverse problem. With lower statistics caused by the limited detected photons, low-dose PET imaging leads to noisy reconstructed images with much quality degradation. Recently, deep neural networks (DNN) have been widely used in computer vision tasks and attracted growing interests in medical imaging. In this paper, we proposed a maximuma posteriori(MAP) reconstruction algorithm incorporating a convolutional neural network (CNN) representation in the formation of the prior. Rather than using the CNN in post-processing, we embedded the neural network in the reconstruction framework for image representation. Using the simulated data, we first quantitatively evaluated our proposed method in terms of the noise-bias tradeoff, and compared with the filtered maximum likelihood (ML), the conventional MAP, and the CNN post-processing methods. In addition to the simulation experiments, the proposed method was further quantitatively validated on the acquired patient brain and body data with the tradeoff between noise and contrast. The results demonstrated that the proposed CNN-MAP method improved noise-bias tradeoff compared with the filtered ML, the conventional MAP, and the CNN post-processing methods in the simulation study. For the patient study, the CNN-MAP method achieved better noise-contrast tradeoff over the other three methods. The quantitative enhancements indicate the potential value of the proposed CNN-MAP method in low-dose PET imaging.

AUTHORS: Yu Fu, Shunjie Dong, Meng Niu, Le Xue, Hanning Guo, Yanyan Huang, Yuanfan Xu, Tianbai Yu, Kuangyu Shi, Qianqian Yang, Yiyu Shi, Hong Zhang, Mei Tian, Cheng Zhuo

JOURNAL: Medical image analysis

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
X-ray computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography (PET) are two of the most commonly used medical imaging technologies for the evaluation of many diseases. Full-dose imaging for CT and PET ensures the image quality but usually raises concerns about the potential health risks of radiation exposure. The contradiction between reducing the radiation exposure and remaining diagnostic performance can be addressed effectively by reconstructing the low-dose CT (L-CT) and low-dose PET (L-PET) images to the same high-quality ones as full-dose (F-CT and F-PET). In this paper, we propose an Attention-encoding Integrated Generative Adversarial Network (AIGAN) to achieve efficient and universal full-dose reconstruction for L-CT and L-PET images. AIGAN consists of three modules: the cascade generator, the dual-scale discriminator and the multi-scale spatial fusion module (MSFM). A sequence of consecutive L-CT (L-PET) slices is first fed into the cascade generator that integrates with a generation-encoding-generation pipeline. The generator plays the zero-sum game with the dual-scale discriminator for two stages: the coarse and fine stages. In both stages, the generator generates the estimated F-CT (F-PET) images as like the original F-CT (F-PET) images as possible. After the fine stage, the estimated fine full-dose images are then fed into the MSFM, which fully explores the inter- and intra-slice structural information, to output the final generated full-dose images. Experimental results show that the proposed AIGAN achieves the state-of-the-art performances on commonly used metrics and satisfies the reconstruction needs for clinical standards.

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Image artefacts continue to pose challenges in clinical molecular imaging, resulting in misdiagnoses, additional radiation doses to patients and financial costs. Mismatch and halo artefacts occur frequently in gallium-68 (68Ga)-labelled compounds whole-body PET/CT imaging. Correcting for these artefacts is not straightforward and requires algorithmic developments, given that conventional techniques have failed to address them adequately. In the current study, we employed differential privacy-preserving federated transfer learning (FTL) to manage clinical data sharing and tackle privacy issues for building centre-specific models that detect and correct artefacts present in PET images.

Methods: Altogether, 1413 patients with68Ga prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)/DOTA-TATE (TOC) PET/CT scans from 3 countries, including 8 different centres, were enrolled in this study. CT-based attenuation and scatter correction (CT-ASC) was used in all centres for quantitative PET reconstruction. Prior to model training, an experienced nuclear medicine physician reviewed all images to ensure the use of high-quality, artefact-free PET images (421 patients' images). A deep neural network (modified U2Net) was trained on 80% of the artefact-free PET images to utilize centre-based (CeBa), centralized (CeZe) and the proposed differential privacy FTL frameworks. Quantitative analysis was performed in 20% of the clean data (with no artefacts) in each centre. A panel of two nuclear medicine physicians conducted qualitative assessment of image quality, diagnostic confidence and image artefacts in 128 patients with artefacts (256 images for CT-ASC and FTL-ASC).

Results: The three approaches investigated in this study for68Ga-PET imaging (CeBa, CeZe and FTL) resulted in a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.42 ± 0.21 (CI 95%: 0.38 to 0.47), 0.32 ± 0.23 (CI 95%: 0.27 to 0.37) and 0.28 ± 0.15 (CI 95%: 0.25 to 0.31), respectively. Statistical analysis using the Wilcoxon test revealed significant differences between the three approaches, with FTL outperforming CeBa and CeZe (p-value < 0.05) in the clean test set. The qualitative assessment demonstrated that FTL-ASC significantly improved image quality and diagnostic confidence and decreased image artefacts, compared to CT-ASC in68Ga-PET imaging. In addition, mismatch and halo artefacts were successfully detected and disentangled in the chest, abdomen and pelvic regions in68Ga-PET imaging.

Conclusion: The proposed approach benefits from using large datasets from multiple centres while preserving patient privacy. Qualitative assessment by nuclear medicine physicians showed that the proposed model correctly addressed two main challenging artefacts in68Ga-PET imaging. This technique could be integrated in the clinic for68Ga-PET imaging artefact detection and disentanglement using multicentric heterogeneous datasets.

ABSTRACT:
Not only visual interpretation for lesion detection, staging, and characterization, but also quantitative treatment response assessment are key roles for18F-FDG PET in oncology. In multicenter oncology PET studies, image quality standardization and SUV harmonization are essential to obtain reliable study outcomes. Standards for image quality and SUV harmonization range should be regularly updated according to progress in scanner performance. Accordingly, the first aim of this study was to propose new image quality reference levels to ensure small lesion detectability. The second aim was to propose a new SUV harmonization range and an image noise criterion to minimize the inter-scanner and intra-scanner SUV variabilities. We collected a total of 37 patterns of images from 23 recent PET/CT scanner models using the NEMA NU2 image quality phantom. PET images with various acquisition durations of 30-300 s and 1800 s were analyzed visually and quantitatively to derive visual detectability scores of the 10-mm-diameter hot sphere, noise-equivalent count (NECphantom), 10-mm sphere contrast (QH,10 mm), background variability (N10 mm), contrast-to-noise ratio (QH,10 mm/N10 mm), image noise level (CVBG), and SUVmax and SUVpeak for hot spheres (10-37 mm diameters). We calculated a reference level for each image quality metric, so that the 10-mm sphere can be visually detected. The SUV harmonization range and the image noise criterion were proposed with consideration of overshoot due to point-spread function (PSF) reconstruction. We proposed image quality reference levels as follows: QH,10 mm/N10 mm≥ 2.5 and CVBG≤ 14.1%. The 10th-90th percentiles in the SUV distributions were defined as the new SUV harmonization range. CVBG≤ 10% was proposed as the image noise criterion, because the intra-scanner SUV variability significantly depended on CVBG. We proposed new image quality reference levels to ensure small lesion detectability. A new SUV harmonization range (in which PSF reconstruction is applicable) and the image noise criterion were also proposed for minimizing the SUV variabilities. Our proposed new standards will facilitate image quality standardization and SUV harmonization of multicenter oncology PET studies. The reliability of multicenter oncology PET studies will be improved by satisfying the new standards.

TITLE: Enhancing 18F-FDG PET image quality and lesion diagnostic performance across different body mass index using the deep progressive learning reconstruction algorithm

AUTHORS: Zhihao Chen, Hongxing Yang, Ming Qi, Wen Chen, Fei Liu, Shaoli Song, Jianping Zhang

JOURNAL: Cancer imaging : the official publication of the International Cancer Imaging Society

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Background: As body mass index (BMI) increases, the quality of 2-deoxy-2-[fluorine-18]fluoro-D-glucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) images reconstructed with ordered subset expectation maximization (OSEM) declines, negatively impacting lesion diagnostics. It is crucial to identify methods that ensure consistent diagnostic accuracy and maintain image quality. Deep progressive learning (DPL) algorithm, an Artificial Intelligence(AI)-based PET reconstruction technique, offers a promising solution.

Methods: 150 patients underwent18F-FDG PET/CT scans and were categorized by BMI into underweight, normal, and overweight groups. PET images were reconstructed using both OSEM and DPL and their image quality was assessed both visually and quantitatively. Visual assessment employed a 5-point Likert scale to evaluate overall score, image sharpness, image noise, and diagnostic confidence. Quantitative assessment parameters included the background liver image-uniformity-index ([Formula: see text]) and signal-to-noise ratio ([Formula: see text]). Additionally, 466 identifiable lesions were categorized by size: sub-centimeter and larger. We compared maximum standard uptake value ([Formula: see text]), signal-to-background ratio ([Formula: see text]), [Formula: see text], contrast-to-background ratio ([Formula: see text]), and contrast-to-noise ratio ([Formula: see text]) of these lesions to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the DPL and OSEM algorithms across different lesion sizes and BMI categories.

Results: DPL produced superior PET image quality compared to OSEM across all BMI groups. The visual quality of DPL showed a slight decline with increasing BMI, while OSEM exhibited a more significant decline. DPL maintained a stable [Formula: see text] across BMI increases, whereas OSEM exhibited increased noise. In the DPL group, quantitative image quality for overweight patients matched that of normal patients with minimal variance from underweight patients. In contrast, OSEM demonstrated significant declines in quantitative image quality with rising BMI. DPL yielded significantly higher contrast ([Formula: see text], [Formula: see text],[Formula: see text]) and [Formula: see text] than OSEM for all lesions across all BMI categories.

Conclusion: DPL consistently provided superior image quality and lesion diagnostic performance compared to OSEM across all BMI categories in18F-FDG PET/CT scans. Therefore, we recommend using the DPL algorithm for18F-FDG PET/CT image reconstruction in all BMI patients.

TITLE: Cycle-consistent learning-based hybrid iterative reconstruction for whole-body PET imaging

AUTHORS: Bao Yang, Long Zhou, Ling Chen, Lijun Lu, Huafeng Liu, Wentao Zhu

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Objective. To develop a cycle-consistent learning-based hybrid iterative reconstruction (IR) method that takes only slightly longer than analytic reconstruction, while pursuing the image resolution and tumor quantification achievable by IR for whole-body PET imaging.Approach. We backproject the raw positron emission tomography (PET) data to generate a blurred activity distribution. From the backprojection to the IR label, a reconstruction mapping that approximates the deblurring filters for the point spread function and the physical effects of the PET system is unrolled to a neural network with stacked convolutional layers. By minimizing the cycle-consistent loss, we train the reconstruction and inverse mappings simultaneously.Main results. In phantom study, the proposed method results in an absolute relative error (RE) of the mean activity of 4.0% ± 0.7% in the largest hot sphere, similar to the RE of the full-count IR and significantly smaller than that obtained by CycleGAN postprocessing. Achieving a noise reduction of 48.1% ± 0.5% relative to the low-count IR, the proposed method demonstrates advantages over the low-count IR and CycleGAN in terms of resolution maintenance, contrast recovery, and noise reduction. In patient study, the proposed method obtains a noise reduction of 44.6% ± 8.0% for the lung and the liver, while maintaining the regional mean activity in both simulated lesions and real tumors. The run time of the proposed method is only half that of the conventional IR.Significance. The proposed cycle-consistent learning from the backprojection rather than the raw PET data or an IR result enables improved reconstruction accuracy, reduced memory requirements, and fast implementation speeds for clinical whole-body PET imaging.

TITLE: Image enhancement of whole-body oncology [18F]-FDG PET scans using deep neural networks to reduce noise

AUTHORS: Abolfazl Mehranian, Scott D Wollenweber, Matthew D Walker, Kevin M Bradley, Patrick A Fielding, Kuan-Hao Su, Robert Johnsen, Fotis Kotasidis, Floris P Jansen, Daniel R McGowan

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: To enhance the image quality of oncology [18F]-FDG PET scans acquired in shorter times and reconstructed by faster algorithms using deep neural networks.

Methods: List-mode data from 277 [18F]-FDG PET/CT scans, from six centres using GE Discovery PET/CT scanners, were split into ¾-, ½- and ¼-duration scans. Full-duration datasets were reconstructed using the convergent block sequential regularised expectation maximisation (BSREM) algorithm. Short-duration datasets were reconstructed with the faster OSEM algorithm. The 277 examinations were divided into training (n = 237), validation (n = 15) and testing (n = 25) sets. Three deep learning enhancement (DLE) models were trained to map full and partial-duration OSEM images into their target full-duration BSREM images. In addition to standardised uptake value (SUV) evaluations in lesions, liver and lungs, two experienced radiologists scored the quality of testing set images and BSREM in a blinded clinical reading (175 series).

Results: OSEM reconstructions demonstrated up to 22% difference in lesion SUVmax, for different scan durations, compared to full-duration BSREM. Application of the DLE models reduced this difference significantly for full-, ¾- and ½-duration scans, while simultaneously reducing the noise in the liver. The clinical reading showed that the standard DLE model with full- or ¾-duration scans provided an image quality substantially comparable to full-duration scans with BSREM reconstruction, yet in a shorter reconstruction time.

Conclusion: Deep learning-based image enhancement models may allow a reduction in scan time (or injected activity) by up to 50%, and can decrease reconstruction time to a third, while maintaining image quality.

ABSTRACT:
Objective.This paper proposes a novel approach for the longitudinal registration of PET imaging acquired for the monitoring of patients with metastatic breast cancer. Unlike with other image analysis tasks, the use of deep learning (DL) has not significantly improved the performance of image registration. With this work, we propose a new registration approach to bridge the performance gap between conventional and DL-based methods: medical image registration method regularized by architecture (MIRRBA).Approach.MIRRBAis a subject-specific deformable registration method which relies on a deep pyramidal architecture to parametrize the deformation field. Diverging from the usual deep-learning paradigms,MIRRBAdoes not require a learning database, but only a pair of images to be registered that is used to optimize the network's parameters. We appliedMIRRBAon a private dataset of 110 whole-body PET images of patients with metastatic breast cancer. We used different architecture configurations to produce the deformation field and studied the results obtained. We also compared our method to several standard registration approaches: two conventional iterative registration methods (ANTs and Elastix) and two supervised DL-based models (LapIRN and Voxelmorph). Registration accuracy was evaluated using the Dice score, the target registration error, the average Hausdorff distance and the detection rate, while the realism of the registration obtained was evaluated using Jacobian's determinant. The ability of the different methods to shrink disappearing lesions was also computed with the disappearing rate.Main results.MIRRBA significantly improved all metrics when compared to DL-based approaches. The organ and lesion Dice scores of Voxelmorph improved by 6% and 52% respectively, while the ones of LapIRN increased by 5% and 65%. Regarding conventional approaches, MIRRBA presented comparable results showing the feasibility of our method.Significance.In this paper, we also demonstrate the regularizing power of deep architectures and present new elements to understand the role of the architecture in DL methods used for registration.

JOURNAL: Medicine

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Evaluate the quantitative, subjective (Deauville score [DS]) and reader agreement differences between standard ordered subset expectation maximization (OSEM) and Bayesian penalized likelihood (BPL) positron emission tomography (PET) reconstruction methods. A retrospective review of 104 F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose PET/computed tomography (CT) exams among 52 patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. An unblinded radiologist moderator reviewed both BPL and OSEM PET/CT exams. Four blinded radiologists then reviewed the annotated cases to provide a visual DS for each annotated lesion. Significant (P < .001) differences in BPL and OSEM PET methods were identified with greater standard uptake value (SUV) maximum and SUV mean for BPL. The DS was altered in 25% of cases when BPL and OSEM were reviewed by the same radiologist. Interobserver DS agreement was higher for OSEM (>1 cm lesion = 0.89 and ≤1 cm lesion = 0.84) compared to BPL (>1 cm lesion = 0.85 and ≤1 cm lesion = 0.81). Among the 4 readers, average intraobserver visual DS agreement between OSEM and BPL was 0.67 for lesions >1cm and 0.4 for lesions ≤1 cm. F-18 Fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma reconstructed with BPL has higher SUV values, altered DSs and reader agreement when compared to OSEM. This report finds volumetric PET measurements such as metabolic tumor volume to be similar between BPL and OSEM PET reconstructions. Efforts such as adoption of European Association Research Ltd accreditation should be made to harmonize PET data with an aim at balancing the need for harmonization and sensitivity for lesion detection.

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Objective. Positron emission tomography (PET) is affected by statistical noise due to constraints on tracer dose and scan duration, impacting both diagnostic performance and quantitative accuracy. While deep learning-based PET denoising methods have been used to improve image quality, they may introduce over-smoothing, which can obscure critical structural details and compromise quantitative accuracy. We propose a method for making a deep learning solution more reliable and apply it to the conditional deep image prior (DIP).Approach. We introduce the idea ofstability informationin the optimization process of conditional DIP, enabling the identification of unstable regions within the network's optimization trajectory. Our method incorporates a stability map, which is derived from multiple intermediate outputs of a moderate neural network at different optimization steps. The final denoised PET image is then obtained by computing a linear combination of the DIP output and the original reconstructed PET image, weighted by the stability map.Main results. We employed eight high-resolution brain PET datasets for comparison. Our method effectively reduces background noise while preserving small structure details in brain [18F]FDG PET images. Comparative analysis demonstrated that our approach outperformed existing methods in terms of peak-to-valley ratio and background noise suppression across various low-dose levels. Additionally, region-of-interest analysis confirmed that the proposed method maintains quantitative accuracy without introducing under- or over-estimation. Furthermore, we applied our method to full-dose PET data to assess its impact on image quality. The results revealed that the proposed method significantly reduced background noise while preserving the peak-to-valley ratio at a level comparable to that of unfiltered full-dose PET images.Significance. The proposed method introduces a robust approach to deep learning-based PET denoising, enhancing its reliability and preserving quantitative accuracy. Furthermore, this strategy can potentially advance performance in high-sensitivity PET scanners and surpass the limit of image quality inherent to PET scanners.

JOURNAL: Clinical nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: The generalizability and trustworthiness of deep learning (DL)-based algorithms depend on the size and heterogeneity of training datasets. However, because of patient privacy concerns and ethical and legal issues, sharing medical images between different centers is restricted. Our objective is to build a federated DL-based framework for PET image segmentation utilizing a multicentric dataset and to compare its performance with the centralized DL approach.

Methods: PET images from 405 head and neck cancer patients from 9 different centers formed the basis of this study. All tumors were segmented manually. PET images converted to SUV maps were resampled to isotropic voxels (3 × 3 × 3 mm3) and then normalized. PET image subvolumes (12 × 12 × 12 cm3) consisting of whole tumors and background were analyzed. Data from each center were divided into train/validation (80% of patients) and test sets (20% of patients). The modified R2U-Net was used as core DL model. A parallel federated DL model was developed and compared with the centralized approach where the data sets are pooled to one server. Segmentation metrics, including Dice similarity and Jaccard coefficients, percent relative errors (RE%) of SUVpeak, SUVmean, SUVmedian, SUVmax, metabolic tumor volume, and total lesion glycolysis were computed and compared with manual delineations.

Results: The performance of the centralized versus federated DL methods was nearly identical for segmentation metrics: Dice (0.84 ± 0.06 vs 0.84 ± 0.05) and Jaccard (0.73 ± 0.08 vs 0.73 ± 0.07). For quantitative PET parameters, we obtained comparable RE% for SUVmean (6.43% ± 4.72% vs 6.61% ± 5.42%), metabolic tumor volume (12.2% ± 16.2% vs 12.1% ± 15.89%), and total lesion glycolysis (6.93% ± 9.6% vs 7.07% ± 9.85%) and negligible RE% for SUVmax and SUVpeak. No significant differences in performance (P > 0.05) between the 2 frameworks (centralized vs federated) were observed.

Conclusion: The developed federated DL model achieved comparable quantitative performance with respect to the centralized DL model. Federated DL models could provide robust and generalizable segmentation, while addressing patient privacy and legal and ethical issues in clinical data sharing.

TITLE: Ultra-Fast List-Mode Reconstruction of Short PET Frames and Example Applications

AUTHORS: Matthew G Spangler-Bickell, Timothy W Deller, Valentino Bettinardi, Floris Jansen

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Standard clinical reconstructions usually require several minutes to complete, and this time is mostly independent of the duration of the data being reconstructed. Applications such as data-driven motion estimation, which require many short frames over the duration of the scan, become unfeasible with such long reconstruction times. In this work, we present an infrastructure whereby ultra-fast list-mode reconstructions of very short frames (≤1 s) are performed. With this infrastructure, it is possible to have a dynamic series of frames that can be used for various applications, such as data-driven motion estimation, whole-body surveys, quick reconstructions of gated data to select the optimal gate for a given attenuation map, and, if the infrastructure runs simultaneously with the scan, real-time display of the reconstructed data during the scan and automated alerts for patient motion.Methods:A fast ray-tracing time-of-flight projector was implemented and parallelized. The reconstruction parameters were optimized to allow for fast performance: only a few iterations are performed, without point-spread-function modeling, and scatter correction is not used. The resulting reconstructions are thus not quantitative but are acceptable for motion estimation and visualization purposes. Data-driven motion can be estimated using image registration, with the resultant motion data being used in a fully motion-corrected list-mode reconstruction.Results:The infrastructure provided images that can be used for visualization and gating purposes and for motion estimation using image registration. Several case studies are presented, including data-driven motion estimation and correction for brain studies, abdominal studies in which respiratory and cardiac motion is visible, and a whole-body survey.Conclusion:The presented infrastructure provides the capability to quickly create a series of very short frames for PET data that can be used in a variety of applications.

TITLE: Reconstruction, analysis and interpretation of posterior probability distributions of PET images, using the posterior bootstrap

AUTHORS: Marina Filipović, Thomas Dautremer, Claude Comtat, Simon Stute, Éric Barat

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
The uncertainty of reconstructed PET images remains difficult to assess and to interpret for the use in diagnostic and quantification tasks. Here we provide (1) an easy-to-use methodology for uncertainty assessment for almost any Bayesian model in PET reconstruction from single datasets and (2) a detailed analysis and interpretation of produced posterior image distributions. We apply a recent posterior bootstrap framework to the PET image reconstruction inverse problem and obtain simple parallelizable algorithms based on random weights and on existing maximuma posteriori(MAP) (posterior maximum) optimization-based algorithms. Posterior distributions are produced, analyzed and interpreted for several common Bayesian models. Their relationship with the distribution of the MAP image estimate over multiple dataset realizations is exposed. The coverage properties of posterior distributions are validated. More insight is obtained for the interpretation of posterior distributions in order to open the way for including uncertainty information into diagnostic and quantification tasks.

Results: The findings revealed that the most influential country, institution, and authors are from the USA, and the most prevalent theme is TOF PET image reconstruction.

Conclusion: The increasing trend in publication in the field of optimization of image processing in PET scans would address the challenges in PET scan by reducing radiation exposure, faster scanning speed, as well as enhancing lesion identification.

TITLE: Deep-TOF-PET: Deep learning-guided generation of time-of-flight from non-TOF brain PET images in the image and projection domains

AUTHORS: Amirhossein Sanaat, Azadeh Akhavanalaf, Isaac Shiri, Yazdan Salimi, Hossein Arabi, Habib Zaidi

JOURNAL: Human brain mapping

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
We aim to synthesize brain time-of-flight (TOF) PET images/sinograms from their corresponding non-TOF information in the image space (IS) and sinogram space (SS) to increase the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast of abnormalities, and decrease the bias in tracer uptake quantification. One hundred forty clinical brain18F-FDG PET/CT scans were collected to generate TOF and non-TOF sinograms. The TOF sinograms were split into seven time bins (0, ±1, ±2, ±3). The predicted TOF sinogram was reconstructed and the performance of both models (IS and SS) compared with reference TOF and non-TOF. Wide-ranging quantitative and statistical analysis metrics, including structural similarity index metric (SSIM), root mean square error (RMSE), as well as 28 radiomic features for 83 brain regions were extracted to evaluate the performance of the CycleGAN model. SSIM and RMSE of 0.99 ± 0.03, 0.98 ± 0.02 and 0.12 ± 0.09, 0.16 ± 0.04 were achieved for the generated TOF-PET images in IS and SS, respectively. They were 0.97 ± 0.03 and 0.22 ± 0.12, respectively, for non-TOF-PET images. The Bland & Altman analysis revealed that the lowest tracer uptake value bias (-0.02%) and minimum variance (95% CI: -0.17%, +0.21%) were achieved for TOF-PET images generated in IS. For malignant lesions, the contrast in the test dataset was enhanced from 3.22 ± 2.51 for non-TOF to 3.34 ± 0.41 and 3.65 ± 3.10 for TOF PET in SS and IS, respectively. The implemented CycleGAN is capable of generating TOF from non-TOF PET images to achieve better image quality.

AUTHORS: Hideaki Tashima, Takumi Nishina, Sodai Takyu, Fumihiko Nishikido, Mikio Suga, Taiga Yamaya

JOURNAL: Radiological physics and technology

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
In Compton PET, that has a scatterer inserted inside a PET ring, there are multi-interaction events that can be treated as both PET and Compton events. A PET event from multi-interaction events that include a Compton event and a photoelectric absorption event or two Compton events can be extracted by applying a PET recovery method. In this study, we aimed to establish a method to maximize image quality by utilizing such redundant events. We conducted brain-scale Monte Carlo simulations of a C-shaped Compton-PET geometry and a whole gamma imaging (WGI) geometry. Images were reconstructed by a hybrid image reconstruction method combining both PET and Compton events. The result showed that the spatial resolution was improved when treated as PET events while keeping the noise level. The effect of improvement was more significant in WGI than in C-shaped Compton PET because the number of events recovered as PET events having more accurate spatial information was much larger in WGI. When the PET-recovered multi-interaction events were also included as Compton events in the hybrid reconstruction, we did not observe any improvement in image quality, while the number of used events was largest. The results suggested that treating events as PET events exclusively was better for image quality.

TITLE: Adaptive rectification based adversarial network with spectrum constraint for high-quality PET image synthesis

AUTHORS: Yanmei Luo, Luping Zhou, Bo Zhan, Yuchen Fei, Jiliu Zhou, Yan Wang, Dinggang Shen

JOURNAL: Medical image analysis

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Positron emission tomography (PET) is a typical nuclear imaging technique, which can provide crucial functional information for early brain disease diagnosis. Generally, clinically acceptable PET images are obtained by injecting a standard-dose radioactive tracer into human body, while on the other hand the cumulative radiation exposure inevitably raises concerns about potential health risks. However, reducing the tracer dose will increase the noise and artifacts of the reconstructed PET image. For the purpose of acquiring high-quality PET images while reducing radiation exposure, in this paper, we innovatively present an adaptive rectification based generative adversarial network with spectrum constraint, named AR-GAN, which uses low-dose PET (LPET) image to synthesize standard-dose PET (SPET) image of high-quality. Specifically, considering the existing differences between the synthesized SPET image by traditional GAN and the real SPET image, an adaptive rectification network (AR-Net) is devised to estimate the residual between the preliminarily predicted image and the real SPET image, based on the hypothesis that a more realistic rectified image can be obtained by incorporating both the residual and the preliminarily predicted PET image. Moreover, to address the issue of high-frequency distortions in the output image, we employ a spectral regularization term in the training optimization objective to constrain the consistency of the synthesized image and the real image in the frequency domain, which further preserves the high-frequency detailed information and improves synthesis performance. Validations on both the phantom dataset and the clinical dataset show that the proposed AR-GAN can estimate SPET images from LPET images effectively and outperform other state-of-the-art image synthesis approaches.

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Monoclonal antibody (mAb)-based PET (immunoPET) imaging can characterise tumour lesions non-invasively. It may be a valuable tool to determine which patients may benefit from treatment with a specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) and evaluate treatment response. For89Zr immunoPET imaging, higher sensitivity of state-of-the art PET/CT systems equipped with silicon photomultiplier (SiPM)-based detector elements may be beneficial as the low positron abundance of89Zr causes a low signal-to-noise level. Moreover, the long physical half-life limits the amount of activity that can be administered to the patients leading to poor image quality even when using long scan durations. Here, we investigated the difference in semiquantitative performance between the PMT-based Biograph mCT, our clinical reference system, and the SiPM-based Biograph Vision PET/CT in89Zr immunoPET imaging. Furthermore, the effects of scan duration reduction using the Vision on semiquantitative imaging parameters and its influence on image quality assessment were evaluated.

Methods: Data were acquired on day 4 post 37 MBq89Zr-labelled mAb injection. Five patients underwent a double scan protocol on both systems. Ten patients were scanned only on the Vision. For PET image reconstruction, three protocols were used, i.e. one camera-dependent protocol and European Association of Nuclear Medicine Research Limited (EARL) standards 1 and 2 compliant protocols. Vision data were acquired in listmode and were reprocessed to obtain images at shorter scan durations. Semiquantitative PET image parameters were derived from tumour lesions and healthy tissues to assess differences between systems and scan durations. Differently reconstructed images obtained using the Vision were visually scored regarding image quality by two nuclear medicine physicians.

Results: When images were reconstructed using 100% acquisition time on both systems following EARL standard 1 compliant reconstruction protocols, results regarding semiquantification were comparable. For Vision data, reconstructed images that conform to EARL1 standards still resulted in comparable semiquantification at shorter scan durations (75% and 50%) regarding 100% acquisition time.

Conclusion: Scan duration of89Zr immunoPET imaging using the Vision can be decreased up to 50% compared with using the mCT while maintaining image quality using the EARL1 compliant reconstruction protocol.

TITLE: Noise2Void: unsupervised denoising of PET images

AUTHORS: Tzu-An Song, Fan Yang, Joyita Dutta

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Objective:Elevated noise levels in positron emission tomography (PET) images lower image quality and quantitative accuracy and are a confounding factor for clinical interpretation. The objective of this paper is to develop a PET image denoising technique based on unsupervised deep learning.Significance:Recent advances in deep learning have ushered in a wide array of novel denoising techniques, several of which have been successfully adapted for PET image reconstruction and post-processing. The bulk of the deep learning research so far has focused on supervised learning schemes, which, for the image denoising problem, require paired noisy and noiseless/low-noise images. This requirement tends to limit the utility of these methods for medical applications as paired training datasets are not always available. Furthermore, to achieve the best-case performance of these methods, it is essential that the datasets for training and subsequent real-world application have consistent image characteristics (e.g. noise, resolution, etc), which is rarely the case for clinical data. To circumvent these challenges, it is critical to develop unsupervised techniques that obviate the need for paired training data.Approach:In this paper, we have adapted Noise2Void, a technique that relies on corrupt images alone for model training, for PET image denoising and assessed its performance using PET neuroimaging data. Noise2Void is an unsupervised approach that uses a blind-spot network design. It requires only a single noisy image as its input, and, therefore, is well-suited for clinical settings. During the training phase, a single noisy PET image serves as both the input and the target. Here we present a modified version of Noise2Void based on a transfer learning paradigm that involves group-level pretraining followed by individual fine-tuning. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of incorporating an anatomical image as a second input to the network.Main Results:We validated our denoising technique using simulation data based on the BrainWeb digital phantom. We show that Noise2Void with pretraining and/or anatomical guidance leads to higher peak signal-to-noise ratios than traditional denoising schemes such as Gaussian filtering, anatomically guided non-local means filtering, and block-matching and 4D filtering. We used the Noise2Noise denoising technique as an additional benchmark. For clinical validation, we applied this method to human brain imaging datasets. The clinical findings were consistent with the simulation results confirming the translational value of Noise2Void as a denoising tool.

TITLE: A back-projection-and-filtering-like (BPF-like) reconstruction method with the deep learning filtration from listmode data in TOF-PET

AUTHORS: Li Lv, Gengsheng L Zeng, Yunlong Zan, Xiang Hong, Minghao Guo, Gaoyu Chen, Weijie Tao, Wenxiang Ding, Qiu Huang

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: The time-of-flight (TOF) information improves signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. Existing analytical algorithms for TOF PET usually follow a filtered back-projection process on reconstructing images from the sinogram data. This work aims to develop a back-projection-and-filtering-like (BPF-like) algorithm that reconstructs the TOF PET image directly from listmode data rapidly.

Methods: We extended the 2D conventional non-TOF PET projection model to a TOF case, where projection data are represented as line integrals weighted by the one-dimensional TOF kernel along the projection direction. After deriving the central slice theorem and the TOF back-projection of listmode data, we designed a deep learning network with a modified U-net architecture to perform the spatial filtration (reconstruction filter). The proposed BP-Net method was validated via Monte Carlo simulations of TOF PET listmode data with three different time resolutions for two types of activity phantoms. The network was only trained on the simulated full-dose XCAT dataset and then evaluated on XCAT and Jaszczak data with different time resolutions and dose levels.

Results: Reconstructed images show that when compared with the conventional BPF algorithm and the MLEM algorithm proposed for TOF PET, the proposed BP-Net method obtains better image quality in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio, relative mean square error, and structure similarity index; besides, the reconstruction speed of the BP-Net is 1.75 times faster than BPF and 29.05 times faster than MLEM using 15 iterations. The results also indicate that the performance of the BP-Net degrades with worse time resolutions and lower tracer doses, but degrades less than BPF or MLEM reconstructions.

Conclusion: In this work, we developed an analytical-like reconstruction in the form of BPF with the reconstruction filtering operation performed via a deep network. The method runs even faster than the conventional BPF algorithm and provides accurate reconstructions from listmode data in TOF-PET, free of rebinning data to a sinogram.

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: To improve the quantitative accuracy and diagnostic confidence of PET images reconstructed without time-of-flight (ToF) using deep learning models trained for ToF image enhancement (DL-ToF).

Methods: A total of 273 [18F]-FDG PET scans were used, including data from 6 centres equipped with GE Discovery MI ToF scanners. PET data were reconstructed using the block-sequential-regularised-expectation-maximisation (BSREM) algorithm with and without ToF. The images were then split into training (n = 208), validation (n = 15), and testing (n = 50) sets. Three DL-ToF models were trained to transform non-ToF BSREM images to their target ToF images with different levels of DL-ToF strength (low, medium, high). The models were objectively evaluated using the testing set based on standardised uptake value (SUV) in 139 identified lesions, and in normal regions of liver and lungs. Three radiologists subjectively rated the models using testing sets based on lesion detectability, diagnostic confidence, and image noise/quality.

Results: The non-ToF, DL-ToF low, medium, and high methods resulted in - 28 ± 18, - 28 ± 19, - 8 ± 22, and 1.7 ± 24% differences (mean; SD) in the SUVmaxfor the lesions in testing set, compared to ToF-BSREM image. In background lung VOIs, the SUVmeandifferences were 7 ± 15, 0.6 ± 12, 1 ± 13, and 1 ± 11% respectively. In normal liver, SUVmeandifferences were 4 ± 5, 0.7 ± 4, 0.8 ± 4, and 0.1 ± 4%. Visual inspection showed that our DL-ToF improved feature sharpness and convergence towards ToF reconstruction. Blinded clinical readings of testing sets for diagnostic confidence (scale 0-5) showed that non-ToF, DL-ToF low, medium, and high, and ToF images scored 3.0, 3.0, 4.1, 3.8, and 3.5 respectively. For this set of images, DL-ToF medium therefore scored highest for diagnostic confidence.

Conclusion: Deep learning-based image enhancement models may provide converged ToF-equivalent image quality without ToF reconstruction. In clinical scoring DL-ToF-enhanced non-ToF images (medium and high) on average scored as high as, or higher than, ToF images. The model is generalisable and hence, could be applied to non-ToF images from BGO-based PET/CT scanners.

ABSTRACT:
Objective.This article explores a new graphics processing unit (GPU)-based techniques for efficient image reconstruction in organ-targeted positron emission tomography (PET) scanners with planar detectors.Approach.GPU-based reconstruction is applied to the Radialis low-dose organ-targeted PET technology, developed to overcome the issues of high exposure and limited spatial resolution inherent in traditional whole-body PET/CT (Computed Tomography) scans. The Radialis planar detector technology is based on four-side tileable sensor modules that can be seamlessly combined into a sensing area of the needed size, optimizing the axial field-of-view for specific organs, and maximizing geometric sensitivity. The article explores the transition from central processing unit-based maximum likelihood expectation maximization algorithms to a GPU-based counterpart, demonstrating a tenfold overall speedup in image reconstruction with a hundredfold improvement in iteration speed.Main results.Through standardized PET performance tests and clinical image analysis, this work demonstrates that GPU-based image reconstruction maintains diagnostic image quality while significantly reducing reconstruction times. The application of this technology, particularly in breast imaging using the Radialis low-dose positron emission mammography, significantly reduces exam times thus improving patient comfort and throughput in clinical settings.Significance.This study represents an important advancement in the clinical workflow of PET imaging, providing insights into optimizing reconstruction algorithms to effectively leverage the parallel processing capabilities of GPUs.

TITLE: Performance evaluation of iterative PET reconstruction with resolution recovery incorporating Gallium-68 positron range correction

AUTHORS: Prodromos Gavriilidis, Michel Koole, Anouk Marinus, Floris P Jansen, Timothy W Deller, Felix M Mottaghy, Roel Wierts

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Background: The distance traveled by the positron before annihilation with an electron, the so-called positron range, negatively effects the positron emission tomography (PET) image quality for radionuclides emitting high-energy positrons such as Gallium-68 (68Ga).

Purpose: In this study, the effect of a tissue-independent positron range correction for Gallium-68 (68Ga-PRC) was investigated based on phantom measurements. The effect of the68Ga-PRC was also explored in four patients.

Methods: The positron range distribution profile of68Ga in water was generated via Monte Carlo simulation. That profile was mapped to a spatially invariant 3D convolution kernel which was incorporated in the OSEM and Q.Clear reconstruction algorithms to perform the68Ga-PRC. In addition, each reconstruction method included point spread function (PSF) modeling and time-of-flight information. For both Fluorine-18 (18F) and68Ga, the NEMA IQ phantom was filled with a sphere-to-background ratio of 10:1 and scanned with the GE Discovery MI 5R PET/CT system. Standard non-positron range correction (PRC) reconstructions were performed for both radionuclides, while also PRC reconstructions were performed for68Ga. Reconstructions parameters (OSEM: number of updates, Q.Clear: beta value) were adapted to achieve similar noise levels between the corresponding reconstructions. The effect of68Ga-PRC was assessed for both OSEM and Q.Clear reconstructions and compared to non-PRC reconstructions for68Ga and18F in terms of image contrast, noise, recovery coefficient (RC), and spatial resolution. For the clinical validation,68Ga-labeled prostate-specific membrane antigen (68Ga-PSMA) and68Ga-DOTATOC PET scans were included of two patients each. For each PET scan, patients were injected with 1.5 MBq/kg of68Ga-PSMA or68Ga-DOTATOC and the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) was calculated and compared to the non-PRC reconstructions.

Results: For OSEM reconstructions, including the68Ga-PRC improved the RC by 9.4% (3.7%-19.3%) and spatial resolution by 21.7% (4.6 mm vs. 3.6 mm) for similar noise levels. For Q.Clear reconstructions,68Ga-PRC modeling improved the RC by 6.7% (2.8%-10.5%) and spatial resolution by 15.3% (5.9 mm vs. 5.0 mm) while obtaining similar noise levels. In the patient data, the use of68Ga-PRC enhanced the CNR by 13.2%.

Conclusions: Including68Ga-PRC in the PET reconstruction enhanced the image quality of68Ga PET data compared to the standard non-PRC reconstructions for similar noise levels. Limited patient results also supported this improvement.

TITLE: An image registration method for voxel-wise analysis of whole-body oncological PET-CT

AUTHORS: Hanna Jönsson, Simon Ekström, Robin Strand, Mette A Pedersen, Daniel Molin, Håkan Ahlström, Joel Kullberg

JOURNAL: Scientific reports

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Whole-body positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) imaging in oncology provides comprehensive information of each patient's disease status. However, image interpretation of volumetric data is a complex and time-consuming task. In this work, an image registration method targeted towards computer-aided voxel-wise analysis of whole-body PET-CT data was developed. The method used both CT images and tissue segmentation masks in parallel to spatially align images step-by-step. To evaluate its performance, a set of baseline PET-CT images of 131 classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) patients and longitudinal image series of 135 head and neck cancer (HNC) patients were registered between and within subjects according to the proposed method. Results showed that major organs and anatomical structures generally were registered correctly. Whole-body inverse consistency vector and intensity magnitude errors were on average less than 5 mm and 45 Hounsfield units respectively in both registration tasks. Image registration was feasible in time and the nearly automatic pipeline enabled efficient image processing. Metabolic tumor volumes of the cHL patients and registration-derived therapy-related tissue volume change of the HNC patients mapped to template spaces confirmed proof-of-concept. In conclusion, the method established a robust point-correspondence and enabled quantitative visualization of group-wise image features on voxel level.

TITLE: Simultaneous Denoising of Dynamic PET Images Based on Deep Image Prior

AUTHORS: Cheng-Hsun Yang, Hsuan-Ming Huang

JOURNAL: Journal of digital imaging

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Parametric imaging obtained from kinetic modeling analysis of dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) data is a useful tool for quantifying tracer kinetics. However, pixel-wise time-activity curves have high noise levels which lead to poor quality of parametric images. To solve this limitation, we proposed a new image denoising method based on deep image prior (DIP). Like the original DIP method, the proposed DIP method is an unsupervised method, in which no training dataset is required. However, the difference is that our method can simultaneously denoise all dynamic PET images. Moreover, we propose a modified version of the DIP method called double DIP (DDIP), which has two DIP architectures. The additional DIP model is used to generate high-quality input data for the second DIP model. Computer simulations were performed to evaluate the performance of the proposed DIP-based methods. Our simulation results showed that the DDIP method outperformed the single DIP method. In addition, the DDIP method combined with data augmentation could generate PET parametric images with superior image quality compared to the spatiotemporal-based non-local means filtering and high constrained backprojection. Our preliminary results show that our proposed DDIP method is a novel and effective unsupervised method for simultaneously denoising dynamic PET images.

TITLE: OIF-Net: An Optical Flow Registration-Based PET/MR Cross-Modal Interactive Fusion Network for Low-Count Brain PET Image Denoising

AUTHORS: Minghan Fu, Na Zhang, Zhenxing Huang, Chao Zhou, Xu Zhang, Jianmin Yuan, Qiang He, Yongfeng Yang, Hairong Zheng, Dong Liang, Fang-Xiang Wu, Wei Fan, Zhanli Hu

JOURNAL: IEEE transactions on medical imaging

ABSTRACT:
The short frames of low-count positron emission tomography (PET) images generally cause high levels of statistical noise. Thus, improving the quality of low-count images by using image postprocessing algorithms to achieve better clinical diagnoses has attracted widespread attention in the medical imaging community. Most existing deep learning-based low-count PET image enhancement methods have achieved satisfying results, however, few of them focus on denoising low-count PET images with the magnetic resonance (MR) image modality as guidance. The prior context features contained in MR images can provide abundant and complementary information for single low-count PET image denoising, especially in ultralow-count (2.5%) cases. To this end, we propose a novel two-stream dual PET/MR cross-modal interactive fusion network with an optical flow pre-alignment module, namely, OIF-Net. Specifically, the learnable optical flow registration module enables the spatial manipulation of MR imaging inputs within the network without any extra training supervision. Registered MR images fundamentally solve the problem of feature misalignment in the multimodal fusion stage, which greatly benefits the subsequent denoising process. In addition, we design a spatial-channel feature enhancement module (SC-FEM) that considers the interactive impacts of multiple modalities and provides additional information flexibility in both the spatial and channel dimensions. Furthermore, instead of simply concatenating two extracted features from these two modalities as an intermediate fusion method, the proposed cross-modal feature fusion module (CM-FFM) adopts cross-attention at multiple feature levels and greatly improves the two modalities' feature fusion procedure. Extensive experimental assessments conducted on real clinical datasets, as well as an independent clinical testing dataset, demonstrate that the proposed OIF-Net outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

TITLE: Comparison of quantitative whole body PET parameters on [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT using ordered Subset Expectation Maximization (OSEM) vs. bayesian penalized likelihood (BPL) reconstruction algorithms in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer

AUTHORS: Narjess Ayati, Lachlan McIntosh, James Buteau, Ramin Alipour, Michal Pudis, Nicholas Daw, Price Jackson, Michael S Hofman

JOURNAL: Cancer imaging : the official publication of the International Cancer Imaging Society

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Background: PSMA PET/CT is a predictive and prognostic biomarker for determining response to [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 in patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Thresholds defined to date may not be generalizable to newer image reconstruction algorithms. Bayesian penalized likelihood (BPL) reconstruction algorithm is a novel reconstruction algorithm that may improve contrast whilst preventing introduction of image noise. The aim of this study is to compare the quantitative parameters obtained using BPL and the Ordered Subset Expectation Maximization (OSEM) reconstruction algorithms.

Methods: Fifty consecutive patients with mCRPC who underwent [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT using OSEM reconstruction to assess suitability for [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 therapy were selected. BPL algorithm was then used retrospectively to reconstruct the same PET raw data. Quantitative and volumetric measurements such as tumour standardised uptake value (SUV)max, SUVmean and Molecular Tumour Volume (MTV-PSMA) were calculated on both reconstruction methods. Results were compared (Bland-Altman, Pearson correlation coefficient) including subgroups with low and high-volume disease burdens (MTV-PSMA cut-off 40 mL).

Results: The SUVmax and SUVmean were higher, and MTV-PSMA was lower in the BPL reconstructed images compared to the OSEM group, with a mean difference of 8.4 (17.5%), 0.7 (8.2%) and - 21.5 mL (-3.4%), respectively. There was a strong correlation between the calculated SUVmax, SUVmean, and MTV-PSMA values in the OSEM and BPL reconstructed images (Pearson r values of 0.98, 0.99, and 1.0, respectively). No patients were reclassified from low to high volume disease or vice versa when switching from OSEM to BPL reconstruction.

Conclusions: [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT quantitative and volumetric parameters produced by BPL and OSEM reconstruction methods are strongly correlated. Differences are proportional and small for SUVmean, which is used as a predictive biomarker. Our study suggests that both reconstruction methods are acceptable without clinical impact on quantitative or volumetric findings. For longitudinal comparison, committing to the same reconstruction method would be preferred to ensure consistency.

TITLE: Impact of PET Reconstruction on Amyloid-β Quantitation in Cross-Sectional and Longitudinal Analyses

AUTHORS: Gihan P Ruwanpathirana, Robert C Williams, Colin L Masters, Christopher C Rowe, Leigh A Johnston, Catherine E Davey

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Amyloid-β (Aβ) accumulation in Alzheimer disease (AD) is typically measured using SUV ratio and the centiloid (CL) scale. The low spatial resolution of PET images is known to degrade quantitative metrics because of the partial-volume effect. This article examines the impact of spatial resolution, as determined by the reconstruction configuration, on the Aβ PET quantitation in both cross-sectional and longitudinal data.Methods:The cross-sectional study involved 89 subjects with 20-min [18F]florbetapir scans generated on an mCT (44 Aβ-negative [Aβ-], 45 Aβ-positive [Aβ+]) using 69 reconstruction configurations, which varied in number of iteration updates, point-spread function, time-of-flight, and postreconstruction smoothing. The subjects were classified as Aβ- or Aβ+ visually. For each reconstruction, Aβ CL was calculated using CapAIBL, and the spatial resolution was calculated as full width at half maximum (FWHM) using the barrel phantom method. The change in CLs and the effect size of the difference in CLs between Aβ- and Aβ+ groups with FWHM were examined. The longitudinal study involved 79 subjects (46 Aβ-, 33 Aβ+) with three 20-min [18F]flutemetamol scans generated on an mCT. The subjects were classified as Aβ- or Aβ+ using a cutoff CL of 20. All scans were reconstructed using low-, medium-, and high-resolution configurations, and Aβ CLs were calculated using CapAIBL. Since linear Aβ accumulation was assumed over a 10-y interval, for each reconstruction configuration, Aβ accumulation rate differences (ARDs) between the second and first periods were calculated for all subjects. Zero ARD was used as a consistency metric. The number of Aβ accumulators was also used to compare the sensitivity of CL across reconstruction configurations.Results:In the cross-sectional study, CLs in both the Aβ- and the Aβ+ groups were impacted by the FWHM of the reconstruction method. Without postreconstruction smoothing, Aβ- CLs increased for a FWHM of 4.5 mm or more, whereas Aβ+ CLs decreased across the FWHM range. High-resolution reconstructions provided the best statistical separation between groups. In the longitudinal study, the median ARD of low-resolution reconstructed data for the Aβ- group was greater than zero whereas the ARDs of higher-resolution reconstructions were not significantly different from zero, indicating more consistent rate estimates in the higher-resolution reconstructions. Higher-resolution reconstructions identified 10 additional Aβ accumulators in the Aβ- group, resulting in a 22% increased group size compared with the low-resolution reconstructions. Higher-resolution reconstructions reduced the average CLs of the negative group by 12 points.Conclusion:High-resolution PET reconstructions, inherently less impacted by partial-volume effect, may improve Aβ PET quantitation in both cross-sectional and longitudinal data. In the cross-sectional analysis, separation of CLs between Aβ- and Aβ+ cohorts increased with spatial resolution. Higher-resolution reconstructions also exhibited both improved consistency and improved sensitivity in measures of Aβ accumulation. These features suggest that higher-resolution reconstructions may be advantageous in early-stage AD therapies.

ABSTRACT:
Objective. Positron Emission Tomography and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (PET-MRI) systems can obtain functional and anatomical scans. But PET suffers from a low signal-to-noise ratio, while MRI are time-consuming. To address time-consuming, an effective strategy involves reducing k-space data collection, albeit at the cost of lowering image quality. This study aims to leverage the inherent complementarity within PET-MRI data to enhance the image quality of PET-MRI.Approach. A novel PET-MRI joint reconstruction model, termed MC-Diffusion, is proposed in the Bayesian framework. The joint reconstruction problem is transformed into a joint regularization problem, where data fidelity terms of PET and MRI are expressed independently. The regular term, the derivative of the logarithm of the joint probability distribution of PET and MRI, employs a joint score-based diffusion model for learning. The diffusion model involves the forward diffusion process and the reverse diffusion process. The forward diffusion process adds noise to transform a complex joint data distribution into a known joint prior distribution for PET and MRI simultaneously, resembling a denoiser. The reverse diffusion process removes noise using a denoiser to revert the joint prior distribution to the original joint data distribution, effectively utilizing joint probability distribution to describe the correlations of PET and MRI for improved quality of joint reconstruction.Main results. Qualitative and quantitative improvements are observed with the MC-Diffusion model. Comparative analysis against LPLS and Joint ISAT-net on the ADNI dataset demonstrates superior performance by exploiting complementary information between PET and MRI. The MC-Diffusion model effectively enhances the quality of PET and MRI images.Significance. This study employs the MC-Diffusion model to enhance the quality of PET-MRI images by integrating the fundamental principles of PET and MRI modalities and leveraging their inherent complementarity. Furthermore, utilizing the diffusion model to learn the joint probability distribution of PET and MRI, thereby elucidating their latent correlation, facilitates a more profound comprehension of the priors obtained through deep learning, contrasting with black-box prior or artificially constructed structural similarities.

TITLE: CG-3DSRGAN: A classification guided 3D generative adversarial network for image quality recovery from low-dose PET images

JOURNAL: Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society. IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society. Annual International Conference

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Positron emission tomography (PET) is the most sensitive molecular imaging modality routinely applied in our modern healthcare. High radioactivity caused by the injected tracer dose is a major concern in PET imaging and limits its clinical applications. However, reducing the dose leads to inadequate image quality for diagnostic practice. Motivated by the need to produce high quality images with minimum 'low-dose', convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based methods have been developed for high quality PET synthesis from its low-dose counterparts. Previous CNNs-based studies usually directly map low-dose PET into features space without consideration of different dose reduction level. In this study, a novel approach named CG-3DSRGAN (Classification-Guided Generative Adversarial Network with Super Resolution Refinement) is presented. Specifically, a multi-tasking coarse generator, guided by a classification head, allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the noise-level features present in the low-dose data, resulting in improved image synthesis. Moreover, to recover spatial details of standard PET, an auxiliary super resolution network - Contextual-Net - is proposed as a second-stage training to narrow the gap between coarse prediction and standard PET. We compared our method to the state-of-the-art methods on whole-body PET with different dose reduction factors (DRF). Experiments demonstrate our method can outperform others on all DRF.Clinical Relevance- Low-Dose PET, PET recovery, GAN, task driven image synthesis, super resolution.

JOURNAL: Current opinion in neurology

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Purpose of review: Hybrid PET- MRI is a technique that has the ability to improve diagnostic accuracy in many applications, whereas PET and MRI performed separately often fail to provide accurate responses to clinical questions. Here, we review recent studies and current developments in PET-MRI, focusing on clinical applications.

Recent findings: The combination of PET and MRI imaging methods aims at increasing the potential of each individual modality. Combined methods of image reconstruction and correction of PET-MRI attenuation are being developed, and a number of applications are being introduced into clinical practice. To date, the value of PET-MRI has been demonstrated for the evaluation of brain tumours in epilepsy and neurodegenerative diseases. Continued advances in data analysis regularly improve the efficiency and the potential application of multimodal biomarkers.

Summary: PET-MRI provides simultaneous of anatomical, functional, biochemical and metabolic information for the personalized characterization and monitoring of neurological diseases. In this review, we show the advantage of the complementarity of different biomarkers obtained using PET-MRI data. We also present the recent advances made in this hybrid imaging modality and its advantages in clinical practice compared with MRI and PET separately.

TITLE: Optimization of reconstruction in quantitative brain PET images: Benefits from PSF modeling and correction of edge artifacts

AUTHORS: Emilie Verrecchia-Ramos, Merwan Ginet, Olivier Morel, Marc Engels-Deutsch, Sinan Ben Mahmoud, Paul Retif

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Background: Modern PET reconstruction algorithms incorporate point-spread-function (PSF) correction to mitigate partial volume effect. However, PSF correction can introduce edge artifacts that lead to quantification errors. Consequently, current international guidelines advise against using PSF correction in brain PET reconstruction.

Purpose: We aimed to investigate PSF-induced quantification errors in recent digital PET systems and identify conditions that mitigate them. This study utilized brain PET imaging with alginate-based realistic phantoms, simulating lesion-to-background activity ratios of 10:1 and 2:1, with eleven reconstruction parameter sets.

Methods: Phantoms were prepared using a commercial anthropomorphic head phantom and two homemade inserts. Each insert contained a homogeneous18F-FDG alginate background with hot spheres of varying diameter (3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 15 mm). PET imaging was conducted on a digital PET-CT system Biograph Vision 600 (Siemens), with a 10 min scan duration. Imaging was performed with and without PSF correction, with 2, 4, 6, 12, 18, or 24 iterations in reconstruction, and with or without additional Gaussian postfiltering. We assessed the recovery coefficient (RC), contrast recovery coefficient (CRC), variability, and CRC-to-variability ratios for each sphere size and reconstruction parameter set.

Results: PSF-corrected images of the 10:1 spheres exhibited a nonmonotonic CRC-to-sphere diameter relationship due to edge artifacts overshoot in the 10 mm-diameter sphere. In contrast, PSF images of the 2:1 spheres showed a monotonically increasing relationship. Non-PSF images of both phantoms showed an expected monotonically increasing CRC-to-sphere diameter relationship but with lower CRC values compared to PSF images. The nonmonotonic relationship observed with 10:1 spheres was mitigated by applying a 3-mm FWHM Gaussian postfiltering. For both phantoms, reconstructions with 6 iterations, PSF correction, and additional 3-mm FWHM Gaussian postfiltering demonstrated the highest CRC-to-variability ratios.

Conclusions: Our findings indicate that Gaussian postfiltering suppresses PSF artifacts. This parameter set corrected the nonmonotonic CRC-to-sphere diameter relationship and improved the CRC-to-variability ratio compared to non-PSF reconstructions. Therefore, to enhance lesion detectability without compromising quantification accuracy, PSF correction coupled with Gaussian postfiltering should be used in brain PET.

TITLE: Revisiting detection of in-transit metastases in melanoma patients using digital 18F-FDG PET/CT with small-voxel reconstruction

AUTHORS: Pierre-André Zimmermann, Benjamin Houdu, Laure Césaire, Ines Nakouri, Michel De Pontville, Charline Lasnon, Nicolas Aide

JOURNAL: Annals of nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Aim: To evaluate the use of digital18F-FDG PET/CT with small-voxels reconstruction for detecting in-transit metastases in melanoma patients with primary lesion located on the upper or lower limbs, in comparison with standard reconstruction and European Association of Nuclear Medicine Research limited (EARL)-compliant reconstruction mimicking former generation PET systems.

Methods: Forty-six PET examinations acquired in list mode on a Vereos digital PET/CT system were reconstructed with (1) the standard reconstruction [2 iterations, 10 subsets (2i10s), point-spread function (PSF) modelling and time-of-flight enabled, no post-filtering and voxel size of 2 mm], (2) a small-voxel reconstruction using 1 mm voxels otherwise using the same parameters, (3) an EARL-compliant reconstruction mimicking a former generation system. Comparison of results across these reconstructions was made for a blind randomized review using a 3-point scale for the presence of in-transit metastases and image quality as well as for tumour-to-background (T/B) ratios and noise level in reference organs.

Results: Seven of the thirty-two EARL-compliant images classified as negative moved to positive on 1mmPSFimages, and 5 of the 6 EARL-compliant images classified as indeterminate moved to positive on 1mmPSFimages (P = 0.01). Amongst a total of 20 PET examinations classified as positive using the 1mmPSFreconstruction, fifteen were considered true positive, five false positive results occurred. Twenty-four patients with 1 mm PSF images were classified as negative, none of those under active surveillance experienced in-transit metastases during the 17 months following their PET examination. The positive likelihood ratio for the 1 mm reconstruction was much higher than that observed for EARL-compliant images (14.7 vs 7.82). Importantly, negative likelihood ratios for the 1 mm and 1mmPSFreconstruction were almost perfect. Compared to EARL-compliant data, T/B ratios extracted from the 1mmPSFshowed a 2.84-fold increase (P < 0.001). A similar pattern of statistically significant increase was observed for noise level in organs of reference. Image quality for the torso was found to be significantly lower for 1mmPSFreconstruction (P = 0.03). Image quality for the limbs was found to be better for 1mmPSF(P < 0.001).

Conclusion: Digital PET with small-voxel reconstruction brings an additional value for the detection of in-transit metastases by reducing the number of indeterminate findings and making up for falsely negative scans using former generation PET systems. An acquisition encompassing lower or upper limbs as appropriate should be performed.

TITLE: Can a ToF-PET photon attenuation reconstruction test stopping-power estimations in proton therapy? A phantom study

AUTHORS: C Bäumer, C M Bäcker, M Conti, P Fragoso Costa, K Herrmann, S L Kazek, W Jentzen, V Panin, S Siegel, M Teimoorisichani, J Wulff, B Timmermann

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

ABSTRACT:
Objective. The aim of the phantom study was to validate and to improve the computed tomography (CT) images used for the dose computation in proton therapy. It was tested, if the joint reconstruction of activity and attenuation images of time-of-flight PET (ToF-PET) scans could improve the estimation of the proton stopping-power.Approach. The attenuation images, i.e. CT images with 511 keV gamma-rays (γCTs), were jointly reconstructed with activity maps from ToF-PET scans. Theβ+activity was produced with FDG and in a separate experiment with proton-induced radioactivation. The phantoms contained slabs of tissue substitutes. The use of theγCTs for the prediction of the beam stopping in proton therapy was based on a linear relationship between theγ-ray attenuation, the electron density, and the stopping-power of fast protons.Main results. The FDG based experiment showed sufficient linearity to detect a bias of bony tissue in the heuristic look-up table, which maps between x-ray CT images and proton stopping-power.γCTs can be used for dose computation, if the electron density of one type of tissue is provided as a scaling factor. A possible limitation is imposed by the spatial resolution, which is inferior by a factor of 2.5 compared to the one of the x-ray CT.γCTs can also be derived from off-line, ToF-PET scans subsequent to the application of a proton field with a hypofractionated dose level.Significance. γCTs are a viable tool to support the estimation of proton stopping with radiotracer-based ToF-PET data from diagnosis or staging. This could be of higher potential relevance in MRI-guided proton therapy.γCTs could form an alternative approach to make use of in-beam or off-line PET scans of proton-inducedβ+activity with possible clinical limitations due to the low number of coincidence counts.

TITLE: Brain partial volume correction with point spreading function reconstruction in high-resolution digital PET: comparison with an MR-based method in FDG imaging

AUTHORS: Masanobu Ibaraki, Keisuke Matsubara, Yuki Shinohara, Miho Shidahara, Kaoru Sato, Hiroyuki Yamamoto, Toshibumi Kinoshita

JOURNAL: Annals of nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Objective: In quantitative positron emission tomography (PET) of the brain, partial volume effect due mainly to the finite spatial resolution of the PET scanner (> 3 mm full width at half maximum [FWHM]) is a primary source of error in the measurement of tracer uptake, especially in small structures such as the cerebral cortex (typically < 3 mm thickness). The aim of this study was to evaluate the partial volume correction (PVC) performance of point spread function-incorporated reconstruction (PSF reconstruction) in combination with the latest digital PET scanner. This evaluation was performed through direct comparisons with magnetic resonance imaging (MR)-based PVC (used as a reference method) in a human brain study.

Methods: Ten healthy subjects underwent brain18F-FDG PET (30-min acquisition) on a digital PET/CT system (Siemens Biograph Vision, 3.5-mm FWHM scanner resolution at the center of the field of view) and anatomical T1-weighted MR imaging for MR-based PVC. PSF reconstruction was applied with a wide range of iterations (4 to 256; 5 subsets). FDG uptake in the cerebral cortex was evaluated using the standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) and compared between PSF reconstruction and MR-based PVC.

Results: Cortical structures were visualized by PSF reconstruction with several tens of iterations and were anatomically well matched with the MR-derived cortical segments. Higher numbers of iterations resulted in higher cortical SUVRs, which approached those of MR-based PVC (1.76), although even with the maximum number of iterations they were still smaller by 16% (1.47), corresponding to approximately 1.5-mm FWHM of the effective spatial resolution.

Conclusion: With the latest digital PET scanner, PSF reconstruction can be used as a PVC technique in brain PET, albeit with suboptimal resolution recovery. A relative advantage of PSF reconstruction is that it can be applied not only to cerebral cortical regions, but also to various small structures such as small brain nuclei that are hardly visualized on anatomical T1-weighted imaging, and thus hardly recovered by MR-based PVC.

TITLE: Small animal PET: a review of what we have done and where we are going

AUTHORS: Robert S Miyaoka, Adrienne L Lehnert

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Small animal research is an essential tool in studying both pharmaceutical biodistribution and disease progression over time. Furthermore, through the rapid development ofin vivoimaging technology over the last few decades, small animal imaging (also referred to as preclinical imaging) has become a mainstay for all fields of biologic research and a center point for most preclinical cancer research. Preclinical imaging modalities include optical, MRI and MRS, microCT, small animal PET, ultrasound, and photoacoustic, each with their individual strengths. The strong points of small animal PET are its translatability to the clinic; its quantitative imaging capabilities; its whole-body imaging ability to dynamically trace functional/biochemical processes; its ability to provide useful images with only nano- to pico- molar concentrations of administered compounds; and its ability to study animals serially over time. This review paper gives an overview of the development and evolution of small animal PET imaging. It provides an overview of detector designs; system configurations; multimodality PET imaging systems; image reconstruction and analysis tools; and an overview of research and commercially available small animal PET systems. It concludes with a look toward developing technologies/methodologies that will further enhance the impact of small animal PET imaging on medical research in the future.

TITLE: Impact of PET data driven respiratory motion correction and BSREM reconstruction of 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT for differentiating neuroendocrine tumors (NET) and intrapancreatic accessory spleens (IPAS)

AUTHORS: Virginia Liberini, Fotis Kotasidis, Valerie Treyer, Michael Messerli, Erika Orita, Ivette Engel-Bicik, Alexander Siebenhüner, Martin W Huellner

JOURNAL: Scientific reports

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
To evaluate whether quantitative PET parameters of motion-corrected68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT can differentiate between intrapancreatic accessory spleens (IPAS) and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (pNET). A total of 498 consecutive patients with neuroendocrine tumors (NET) who underwent68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT between March 2017 and July 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. Subjects with accessory spleens (n = 43, thereof 7 IPAS) and pNET (n = 9) were included, resulting in a total of 45 scans. PET images were reconstructed using ordered-subsets expectation maximization (OSEM) and a fully convergent iterative image reconstruction algorithm with β-values of 1000 (BSREM1000). A data-driven gating (DDG) technique (MOTIONFREE, GE Healthcare) was applied to extract respiratory triggers and use them for PET motion correction within both reconstructions. PET parameters among different samples were compared using non-parametric tests. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analyzed the ability of PET parameters to differentiate IPAS and pNETs. SUVmax was able to distinguish pNET from accessory spleens and IPAs in BSREM1000reconstructions (p < 0.05). This result was more reliable using DDG-based motion correction (p < 0.003) and was achieved in both OSEM and BSREM1000reconstructions. For differentiating accessory spleens and pNETs with specificity 100%, the ROC analysis yielded an AUC of 0.742 (sensitivity 56%)/0.765 (sensitivity 56%)/0.846 (sensitivity 62%)/0.840 (sensitivity 63%) for SUVmax 36.7/41.9/36.9/41.7 in OSEM/BSREM1000/OSEM + DDG/BSREM1000+ DDG, respectively. BSREM1000+ DDG can accurately differentiate pNET from accessory spleen. Both BSREM1000and DDG lead to a significant SUV increase compared to OSEM and non-motion-corrected data.

JOURNAL: Seminars in cancer biology

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Based on the advantages of revealing the functional status and molecular expression of tumor cells, positron emission tomography (PET) imaging has been performed in numerous types of malignant diseases for diagnosis and monitoring. However, insufficient image quality, the lack of a convincing evaluation tool and intra- and interobserver variation in human work are well-known limitations of nuclear medicine imaging and restrict its clinical application. Artificial intelligence (AI) has gained increasing interest in the field of medical imaging due to its powerful information collection and interpretation ability. The combination of AI and PET imaging potentially provides great assistance to physicians managing patients. Radiomics, an important branch of AI applied in medical imaging, can extract hundreds of abstract mathematical features of images for further analysis. In this review, an overview of the applications of AI in PET imaging is provided, focusing on image enhancement, tumor detection, response and prognosis prediction and correlation analyses with pathology or specific gene mutations in several types of tumors. Our aim is to describe recent clinical applications of AI-based PET imaging in malignant diseases and to focus on the description of possible future developments.

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Objective.In this study, we explore positron emission tomography (PET)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) joint reconstruction within a deep learning framework, introducing a novel synergistic method.Approach.We propose a new approach based on a variational autoencoder (VAE) constraint combined with the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) optimization technique. We explore three VAE architectures, joint VAE, product of experts-VAE and multimodal JS divergence (MMJSD), to determine the optimal latent representation for the two modalities. We then trained and evaluated the architectures on a brain PET/MRI dataset.Main results.We showed that our approach takes advantage of each modality sharing information to each other, which results in improved peak signal-to-noise ratio and structural similarity as compared with traditional reconstruction, particularly for short acquisition times. We find that the one particular architecture, MMJSD, is the most effective for our methodology.Significance.The proposed method outperforms conventional approaches especially in noisy and undersampled conditions by making use of the two modalities together to compensate for the missing information.

TITLE: Use of dynamic reconstruction for parametric Patlak imaging in dynamic whole body PET

AUTHORS: Zacharias Chalampalakis, Simon Stute, Marina Filipović, Florent Sureau, Claude Comtat

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Dynamic whole body (DWB) PET acquisition protocols enable the use of whole body parametric imaging for clinical applications. In FDG imaging, accurate parametric images of PatlakKican be complementary to regular standardised uptake value images and improve on current applications or enable new ones. In this study we consider DWB protocols implemented on clinical scanners with a limited axial field of view with the use of multiple whole body sweeps. These protocols result in temporal gaps in the dynamic data which produce noisier and potentially more biased parametric images, compared to single bed (SB) dynamic protocols. Dynamic reconstruction using the Patlak model has been previously proposed to overcome these limits and shown improved DWB parametric images ofKi. In this work, we propose and make use of a spectral analysis based model for dynamic reconstruction and parametric imaging of PatlakKi. Both dynamic reconstruction methods were evaluated for DWB FDG protocols and compared against 3D reconstruction based parametric imaging from SB dynamic protocols. This work was conducted on simulated data and results were tested against real FDG dynamic data. We showed that dynamic reconstruction can achieve levels of parametric image noise and bias comparable to 3D reconstruction in SB dynamic studies, with the spectral model offering additional flexibility and further reduction of image noise. Comparisons were also made between step and shoot and continuous bed motion (CBM) protocols, which showed that CBM can achieve lower parametric image noise due to reduced acquisition temporal gaps. Finally, our results showed that dynamic reconstruction improved VOI parametric mean estimates but did not result to fully converged values before resulting in undesirable levels of noise. Additional regularisation methods need to be considered for DWB protocols to ensure both accurate quantification and acceptable noise levels for clinical applications.

TITLE: Prior Knowledge-Guided Triple-Domain Transformer-GAN for Direct PET Reconstruction From Low-Count Sinograms

AUTHORS: Jiaqi Cui, Pinxian Zeng, Xinyi Zeng, Yuanyuan Xu, Peng Wang, Jiliu Zhou, Yan Wang, Dinggang Shen

JOURNAL: IEEE transactions on medical imaging

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
To obtain high-quality positron emission tomography (PET) images while minimizing radiation exposure, numerous methods have been dedicated to acquiring standard-count PET (SPET) from low-count PET (LPET). However, current methods have failed to take full advantage of the different emphasized information from multiple domains, i.e., the sinogram, image, and frequency domains, resulting in the loss of crucial details. Meanwhile, they overlook the unique inner-structure of the sinograms, thereby failing to fully capture its structural characteristics and relationships. To alleviate these problems, in this paper, we proposed a prior knowledge-guided transformer-GAN that unites triple domains of sinogram, image, and frequency to directly reconstruct SPET images from LPET sinograms, namely PK-TriDo. Our PK-TriDo consists of a Sinogram Inner-Structure-based Denoising Transformer (SISD-Former) to denoise the input LPET sinogram, a Frequency-adapted Image Reconstruction Transformer (FaIR-Former) to reconstruct high-quality SPET images from the denoised sinograms guided by the image domain prior knowledge, and an Adversarial Network (AdvNet) to further enhance the reconstruction quality via adversarial training. Specifically tailored for the PET imaging mechanism, we injected a sinogram embedding module that partitions the sinograms by rows and columns to obtain 1D sequences of angles and distances to faithfully preserve the inner-structure of the sinograms. Moreover, to mitigate high-frequency distortions and enhance reconstruction details, we integrated global-local frequency parsers (GLFPs) into FaIR-Former to calibrate the distributions and proportions of different frequency bands, thus compelling the network to preserve high-frequency details. Evaluations on three datasets with different dose levels and imaging scenarios demonstrated that our PK-TriDo outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

TITLE: The Role of AI in Lymphoma: An Update

AUTHORS: James Cairns, Russell Frood, Chirag Patel, Andrew Scarsbrook

JOURNAL: Seminars in nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Malignant lymphomas encompass a range of malignancies with incidence rising globally, particularly with age. In younger populations, Hodgkin and Burkitt lymphomas predominate, while older populations more commonly experience subtypes such as diffuse large B-cell, follicular, marginal zone, and mantle cell lymphomas. Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) using [18F] fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is the gold standard for staging, treatment response assessment, and prognostication in lymphoma. However, interpretation of PET/CT is complex, time-consuming, and reliant on expert imaging specialists, exacerbating challenges associated with workforce shortages worldwide. Artificial intelligence (AI) offers transformative potential across multiple aspects of PET/CT imaging in this setting. AI applications in appointment planning have demonstrated utility in reducing nonattendance rates and improving departmental efficiency. Advanced reconstruction techniques leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) enable reduced injected activities of radiopharmaceutical and patient dose whilst maintaining diagnostic accuracy, particularly benefiting younger patients requiring multiple scans. Automated segmentation tools, predominantly using 3D U-Net architectures, have improved quantification of metrics such as total metabolic tumour volume (TMTV) and total lesion glycolysis (TLG), facilitating prognostication and treatment stratification. Despite these advancements, challenges remain, including variability in segmentation performance, impact on Deauville Score interpretation, and standardization of TMTV/TLG measurements. Emerging large language models (LLMs) also show promise in enhancing PET/CT reporting, converting free-text reports into structured formats, and improving patient communication. Further research is required to address limitations such as AI-induced errors, physiological uptake differentiation, and the integration of AI models into clinical workflows. With robust validation and harmonization, AI integration could significantly enhance lymphoma care, improving diagnostic precision, workflow efficiency, and patient outcomes.

AUTHORS: Hossein Arabi, Abdollah Saberi Manesh, Habib Zaidi

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
This review casts a spotlight on intraoperative positron emission tomography (PET) scanners and the distinctive challenges they confront. Specifically, these systems contend with the necessity of partial coverage geometry, essential for ensuring adequate access to the patient. This inherently leans them towards limited-angle PET imaging, bringing along its array of reconstruction and geometrical sensitivity challenges. Compounding this, the need for real-time imaging in navigation systems mandates rapid acquisition and reconstruction times. For these systems, the emphasis is on dependable PET image reconstruction (without significant artefacts) while rapid processing takes precedence over the spatial resolution of the system. In contrast, specimen PET imagers are unburdened by the geometrical sensitivity challenges, thanks to their ability to leverage full coverage PET imaging geometries. For these devices, the focus shifts: high spatial resolution imaging takes precedence over rapid image reconstruction. This review concurrently probes into the technical complexities of both intraoperative and specimen PET imaging, shedding light on their recent designs, inherent challenges, and technological advancements.

JOURNAL: Medical image analysis

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
The high noise level of dynamic Positron Emission Tomography (PET) images degrades the quality of parametric images. In this study, we aim to improve the quality and quantitative accuracy of Kiimages by utilizing deep learning techniques to reduce the noise in dynamic PET images. We propose a novel denoising technique, Population-based Deep Image Prior (PDIP), which integrates population-based prior information into the optimization process of Deep Image Prior (DIP). Specifically, the population-based prior image is generated from a supervised denoising model that is trained on a prompts-matched static PET dataset comprising 100 clinical studies. The 3D U-Net architecture is employed for both the supervised model and the following DIP optimization process. We evaluated the efficacy of PDIP for noise reduction in 25%-count and 100%-count dynamic PET images from 23 patients by comparing with two other baseline techniques: the Prompts-matched Supervised model (PS) and a conditional DIP (CDIP) model that employs the mean static PET image as the prior. Both the PS and CDIP models show effective noise reduction but result in smoothing and removal of small lesions. In addition, the utilization of a single static image as the prior in the CDIP model also introduces a similar tracer distribution to the denoised dynamic frames, leading to lower Kiin general as well as incorrect Kiin the descending aorta. By contrast, as the proposed PDIP model utilizes intrinsic image features from the dynamic dataset and a large clinical static dataset, it not only achieves comparable noise reduction as the supervised and CDIP models but also improves lesion Kipredictions.

TITLE: Supervised learning with cyclegan for low-dose FDG PET image denoising

AUTHORS: Long Zhou, Joshua D Schaefferkoetter, Ivan W K Tham, Gang Huang, Jianhua Yan

JOURNAL: Medical image analysis

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
PET imaging involves radiotracer injections, raising concerns about the risk of radiation exposure. To minimize the potential risk, one way is to reduce the injected tracer. However, this will lead to poor image quality with conventional image reconstruction and processing. In this paper, we proposed a supervised deep learning model, CycleWGANs, to boost low-dose PET image quality. Validations were performed on a low dose dataset simulated from a real dataset with biopsy-proven primary lung cancer or suspicious radiological abnormalities. Low dose PET images were reconstructed on reduced PET raw data by randomly discarding events in the PET list mode data towards the count level of 1 million. Traditional image denoising methods (Non-Local Mean (NLM) and block-matching 3D(BM3D)) and two recently-published deep learning methods (RED-CNN and 3D-cGAN) were included for comparisons. At the count level of 1 million (true counts), the proposed model can accurately estimate full-dose PET image from low-dose input image, which is superior to the other four methods in terms of the mean and maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmeanand SUVmax) bias for lesions and normal tissues. The bias of SUV (SUVmean, SUVmax) for lesions and normal tissues are (-2.06±3.50%,-0.84±6.94%) and (-0.45±5.59%, N/A) in the estimated PET images, respectively. However, the RED-CNN achieved the best score in traditional metrics, such as structure similarity (SSIM), peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) and normalized root mean square error (NRMSE). Correlation and profile analyses have successfully explained this phenomenon and further suggested that our method could effectively preserve edge and also SUV values than RED-CNN, 3D-cGAN and NLM with a slightly higher noise.

TITLE: From CNNs to GANs for cross-modality medical image estimation

AUTHORS: Azin Shokraei Fard, David C Reutens, Viktor Vegh

JOURNAL: Computers in biology and medicine

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Cross-modality image estimation involves the generation of images of one medical imaging modality from that of another modality. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been shown to be useful in image-to-image intensity projections, in addition to identifying, characterising and extracting image patterns. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) use CNNs as generators and estimated images are classified as true or false based on an additional discriminator network. CNNs and GANs within the image estimation framework may be considered more generally as deep learning approaches, since medical images tend to be large in size, leading to the need for large neural networks. Most research in the CNN/GAN image estimation literature has involved the use of MRI data with the other modality primarily being PET or CT. This review provides an overview of the use of CNNs and GANs for cross-modality medical image estimation. We outline recently proposed neural networks and detail the constructs employed for CNN and GAN image-to-image synthesis. Motivations behind cross-modality image estimation are outlined as well. GANs appear to provide better utility in cross-modality image estimation in comparison with CNNs, a finding drawn based on our analysis involving metrics comparing estimated and actual images. Our final remarks highlight key challenges faced by the cross-modality medical image estimation field, including how intensity projection can be constrained by registration (unpaired versus paired data), use of image patches, additional networks, and spatially sensitive loss functions.

AUTHORS: Bangyan Huang, Tiantian Li, Gerard Arino-Estrada, Kamil Dulski, Roman Y Shopa, Pawel Moskal, Ewa Stepien, Jinyi Qi

JOURNAL: IEEE transactions on medical imaging

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Positron emission tomography (PET) is a widely utilized medical imaging modality that uses positron-emitting radiotracers to visualize biochemical processes in a living body. The spatiotemporal distribution of a radiotracer is estimated by detecting the coincidence photon pairs generated through positron annihilations. In human tissue, about 40% of the positrons form positroniums prior to the annihilation. The lifetime of these positroniums is influenced by the microenvironment in the tissue and could provide valuable information for better understanding of disease progression and treatment response. Currently, there are few methods available for reconstructing high-resolution lifetime images in practical applications. This paper presents an efficient statistical image reconstruction method for positronium lifetime imaging (PLI). We also analyze the random triple-coincidence events in PLI and propose a correction method for random events, which is essential for real applications. Both simulation and experimental studies demonstrate that the proposed method can produce lifetime images with high numerical accuracy, low variance, and resolution comparable to that of the activity images generated by a PET scanner with currently available time-of-flight resolution.

ABSTRACT:
Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging afterY liver radioembolization is used for both lesion identification and dosimetry. Bayesian penalized likelihood (BPL) reconstruction algorithms are an alternative to ordered subset expectation maximization (OSEM) with improved image quality and lesion detectability. The investigation of optimal parameters forY image reconstruction of Q.Clear, a commercial BPL algorithm developed by General Electric (GE), in PET/MR is a field of interest and the subject of this study. The NEMA phantom was filled at an 8:1 sphere-to-background ratio. Acquisitions were performed on a PET/MR scanner for clinically relevant activities between 0.7 and 3.3 MBq/ml. Reconstructions with Q.Clear were performed varying theβpenalty parameter between 20 and 6000, the acquisition time between 5 and 20 min and pixel size between 1.56 and 4.69 mm. OSEM reconstructions of 28 subsets with 2 and 4 iterations with and without Time-of-Flight (TOF) were compared to Q.Clear withβ= 4000. Recovery coefficients (RC), their coefficient of variation (COV), background variability (BV), contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and residual activity in the cold insert were evaluated. Increasingβparameter lowered RC, COV and BV, while CNR was maximized atβ= 4000; further increase resulted in oversmoothing. For quantification purposes,β= 1000-2000 could be more appropriate. Longer acquisition times resulted in larger CNR due to reduced image noise. Q.Clear reconstructions led to higher CNR than OSEM. Aβof 4000 was obtained for optimal image quality, although lower values could be considered for quantification purposes. An optimal acquisition time of 15 min was proposed considering its clinical use.

ABSTRACT:
Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) is a hybrid medical imaging technique that combines PET and CT to provide detailed images of the body's anatomical structures and metabolic activity. It is frequently used for oncology and other medical diagnoses. This overview aims to examine how artificial intelligence (AI) has been used in PET/CT, based on recent state-of-art. There are a number of clinical questions in Nuclear Medicine, and AI could provide answers, having the capability to enhance various aspects of medical imaging. The overview focuses on how machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), enhance tumor segmentation, classification, diagnosis, disease-free survival prediction and treatment response prediction in oncology. The analysis showed that the application of AI provides reliable results, especially in the fields of classification and diagnosis. In addition, radiomics is a novel research field enabling quantitative analysis of medical images through feature extraction, utilized for AI model implementation. Despite these advances, addressing issues such as dataset size, standardization, and ethical concerns are essential for broad clinical integration of AI in PET/CT oncology imaging.

TITLE: Deep learning for improving PET/CT attenuation correction by elastic registration of anatomical data

AUTHORS: Joshua Schaefferkoetter, Vijay Shah, Charles Hayden, John O Prior, Sven Zuehlsdorff

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Background: For PET/CT, the CT transmission data are used to correct the PET emission data for attenuation. However, subject motion between the consecutive scans can cause problems for the PET reconstruction. A method to match the CT to the PET would reduce resulting artifacts in the reconstructed images.

Purpose: This work presents a deep learning technique for inter-modality, elastic registration of PET/CT images for improving PET attenuation correction (AC). The feasibility of the technique is demonstrated for two applications: general whole-body (WB) imaging and cardiac myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI), with a specific focus on respiratory and gross voluntary motion.

Materials and methods: A convolutional neural network (CNN) was developed and trained for the registration task, comprising two distinct modules: a feature extractor and a displacement vector field (DVF) regressor. It took as input a non-attenuation-corrected PET/CT image pair and returned the relative DVF between them-it was trained in a supervised fashion using simulated inter-image motion. The 3D motion fields produced by the network were used to resample the CT image volumes, elastically warping them to spatially match the corresponding PET distributions. Performance of the algorithm was evaluated in different independent sets of WB clinical subject data: for recovering deliberate misregistrations imposed in motion-free PET/CT pairs and for improving reconstruction artifacts in cases with actual subject motion. The efficacy of this technique is also demonstrated for improving PET AC in cardiac MPI applications.

Results: A single registration network was found to be capable of handling a variety of PET tracers. It demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in the PET/CT registration task and was able to significantly reduce the effects of simulated motion imposed in motion-free, clinical data. Registering the CT to the PET distribution was also found to reduce various types of AC artifacts in the reconstructed PET images of subjects with actual motion. In particular, liver uniformity was improved in the subjects with significant observable respiratory motion. For MPI, the proposed approach yielded advantages for correcting artifacts in myocardial activity quantification and potentially for reducing the rate of the associated diagnostic errors.

Conclusion: This study demonstrated the feasibility of using deep learning for registering the anatomical image to improve AC in clinical PET/CT reconstruction. Most notably, this improved common respiratory artifacts occurring near the lung/liver border, misalignment artifacts due to gross voluntary motion, and quantification errors in cardiac PET imaging.

TITLE: Data-Driven Image-Based Protocol for Brain PET Image Harmonization

AUTHORS: Eva Štokelj, Urban Simončič, For The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative

JOURNAL: Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Quantitative FDG-PET brain imaging across multiple centers is challenged by inter-scanner variability, impacting the comparability of neuroimaging data. This study proposes a data-driven image-based harmonization protocol to address these discrepancies without relying on traditional phantom scans. The protocol uses spatially normalized FDG-PET brain images to estimate scanner-specific Gaussian smoothing filters, optimizing parameters via the structural similarity index (SSIM). Validation was performed using images from cognitively normal individuals and Alzheimer's disease patients from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Results demonstrated robust harmonization at moderate target resolutions (8 and 10 mm FWHM), with filter estimates consistently within 1.2 mm of phantom-derived ground truths. However, at higher resolutions (6 mm FWHM), discrepancies reached up to 3 mm, reflecting reduced accuracy. These deviations were particularly evident for high-resolution scanners like HRRT, likely due to elevated noise levels and smaller sample sizes. The presented harmonization method effectively reduces inter-scanner variability in retrospective FDG-PET studies, especially valuable when phantom scans are unavailable. Nonetheless, the current limitations at finer resolutions underline the necessity for methodological refinements to meet the demands of evolving high-resolution PET imaging technologies.

TITLE: A Generalized Linear modeling approach to bootstrapping multi-frame PET image data

AUTHORS: Finbarr O'Sullivan, Fengyun Gu, Qi Wu, Liam D O'Suilleabhain

JOURNAL: Medical image analysis

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
PET imaging is an important diagnostic tool for management of patients with cancer and other diseases. Medical decisions based on quantitative PET information could potentially benefit from the availability of tools for evaluation of associated uncertainties. Raw PET data can be viewed as a sample from an inhomogeneous Poisson process so there is the possibility to directly apply bootstrapping to raw projection-domain list-mode data. Unfortunately this is computationally impractical, particularly if data reconstruction is iterative or the acquisition protocol is dynamic. We develop a flexible statistical linear model analysis to be used with multi-frame PET image data to create valid bootstrap samples. The technique is illustrated using data from dynamic PET studies with fluoro-deoxyglucose (FDG) and fluoro-thymidine (FLT) in brain and breast cancer patients. As is often the case with dynamic PET studies, data have been archived without raw list-mode information. Using the bootstrapping technique maps of kinetic parameters and associated uncertainties are obtained. The quantitative performance of the approach is assessed by simulation. The proposed image-domain bootstrap is found to substantially match the projection-domain alternative. Analysis of results points to a close relation between relative uncertainty in voxel-level kinetic parameters and local reconstruction error. This is consistent with statistical theory.

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: The Bayesian penalized likelihood (BPL) reconstruction algorithm, Q.Clear, can achieve a higher signal-to-noise ratio on images and more accurate quantitation than ordered subset-expectation maximization (OSEM). The reconstruction parameter (β) in BPL requires optimization according to the radiopharmaceutical tracer. The present study aimed to define the optimal β value in BPL required to diagnose Alzheimer disease from brain positron emission tomography (PET) images acquired using18F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose ([18F]FDG) and11C-labeled Pittsburg compound B ([11C]PiB).

Methods: Images generated from Hoffman 3D brain and cylindrical phantoms were acquired using a Discovery PET/computed tomography (CT) 710 and reconstructed using OSEM + time-of-flight (TOF) under clinical conditions and BPL + TOF (β = 20-1000). Contrast was calculated from images generated by the Hoffman 3D brain phantom, and noise and uniformity were calculated from those generated by the cylindrical phantom. Five cognitively healthy controls and five patients with Alzheimer disease were assessed using [18F]FDG and [11C]PiB PET to validate the findings from the phantom study. The β values were restricted by the findings of the phantom study, then one certified nuclear medicine physician and two certified nuclear medicine technologists visually determined optimal β values by scoring the quality parameters of image contrast, image noise, cerebellar stability, and overall image quality of PET images from 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent).

Results: The contrast in BPL satisfied the Japanese Society of Nuclear Medicine (JSNM) criterion of ≥55% and exceeded that of OSEM at ranges of β = 20-450 and 20-600 for [18F]FDG and [11C]PiB, respectively. The image noise in BPL satisfied the JSNM criterion of ≤15% and was below that in OSEM when β = 150-1000 and 400-1000 for [18F]FDG and [11C]PiB, respectively. The phantom study restricted the ranges of β values to 100-300 and 300-500 for [18F]FDG and [11C]PiB, respectively. The BPL scores for gray-white matter contrast and image noise, exceeded those of OSEM in [18F]FDG and [11C]PiB images regardless of β values. Visual evaluation confirmed that the optimal β values were 200 and 450 for [18F]FDG and [11C]PiB, respectively.

Conclusions: The BPL achieved better image contrast and less image noise than OSEM, while maintaining quantitative standardized uptake value ratios (SUVR) due to full convergence, more rigorous noise control, and edge preservation. The optimal β values for [18F]FDG and [11C]PiB brain PET were apparently 200 and 450, respectively. The present study provides useful information about how to determine optimal β values in BPL for brain PET imaging.

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with [18F]FDG provides valuable information regarding the underlying pathological processes in neurodegenerative disorders. PET imaging for these populations should be as short as possible to limit head movements and improve comfort. This study aimed to validate an optimized [18F]FDG-PET image reconstruction protocol aiming to reduce acquisition time while maintaining adequate quantification accuracy and image quality.

Methods: A time-reduced reconstruction protocol (5 min) was evaluated in [18F]FDG-PET retrospective data from healthy individuals and Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Standard (8 min) and time-reduced protocols were compared by means of image quality and quantification accuracy metrics, as well as standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) and Z-scores (pons was used as reference). Images were randomly and blindly presented to experienced physicians and scored in terms of image quality.

Results: No differences between protocols were identified during the visual assessment. Small differences (p < 0.01) in the pons SUVR were observed between the standard and time-reduced protocols for healthy individuals (-0.002 ± 0.011) and AD patients (-0.007 ± 0.013). Likewise, incorporating the PSF correction in the reconstruction algorithm resulted in small differences (p < 0.01) in SUVR between protocols (healthy individuals: -0.003 ± 0.011; AD patients: -0.007 ± 0.014).

Conclusion: Quality metrics were similar between time-reduced and standard protocols. In the visual assessment of the images, the physicians did not consider the use of PSF adequate, as it degraded the quality image. Shortening the acquisition time is possible by optimizing the image reconstruction parameters while maintaining adequate quantification accuracy and image quality.

TITLE: Qualitative and Quantitative Assessment of Nonlocal Means Reconstruction Algorithm in a Flexible PET Scanner

AUTHORS: Masao Watanabe, Yuji Nakamoto, Ryusuke Nakamoto, Takayoshi Ishimori, Tsuneo Saga, Kaori Togashi

JOURNAL: AJR. American journal of roentgenology

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
OBJECTIVE.Flexible PET (fxPET) was designed to fit existing MRI systems. The newly modified nonlocal means (NLM) algorithm is combined with the 3D dynamic row-action maximum likelihood algorithm (DRAMA). We investigated qualitative and quantitative acceptability of fxPET images reconstructed by modified NLM compared with whole-body (WB) PET/CT images and conventional 3D DRAMA reconstruction alone.MATERIALS AND METHODS.Fifty-nine patients with known or suspected malignancies underwent WB PET/CT scanning approximately 1 hour after the injection of18F-FDG, after which they underwent fxPET scanning. Two readers rated the quality of fxPET images by consensus. Detection rate (the proportion of lesions found on PET), maximal standardized uptake value (SUVmax), metabolic tumor volume (MTV), total lesion glycolysis (TLG), tumor-to-normal liver ratio (TNR), and background liver signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) were compared among the three datasets.RESULTS.Higher image quality was obtained by modified NLM reconstruction than by conventional reconstruction without statistical significance. The detection rate was comparable among three datasets. SUVmaxwas significantly higher, and MTV and TLG were significantly lower in the modified NLM dataset (p< 0.002) than in the other two datasets, with significantly positive correlations (p< 0.001; Spearman rank correlation coefficient, 0.87-0.99). The TNRs in modified NLM images were significantly larger than in the other datasets (p< 0.05). The background SNRs in modified NLM images were comparable with those in WB PET/CT images, and significantly higher than in the conventional fxPET images (p< 0.005).CONCLUSION.The modified NLM algorithm was clinically acceptable, yielding higher TNR and background SNR compared with conventional reconstruction. Image quality and the lesion detection rate were comparable in this population.

TITLE: PET scatter estimation using deep learning U-Net architecture

AUTHORS: Baptiste Laurent, Alexandre Bousse, Thibaut Merlin, Stephan Nekolla, Dimitris Visvikis

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Objective.Positron emission tomography (PET) image reconstruction needs to be corrected for scatter in order to produce quantitatively accurate images. Scatter correction is traditionally achieved by incorporating an estimated scatter sinogram into the forward model during image reconstruction. Existing scatter estimated methods compromise between accuracy and computing time. Nowadays scatter estimation is routinely performed using single scatter simulation (SSS), which does not accurately model multiple scatter and scatter from outside the field-of-view, leading to reduced qualitative and quantitative PET reconstructed image accuracy. On the other side, Monte-Carlo (MC) methods provide a high precision, but are computationally expensive and time-consuming, even with recent progress in MC acceleration.Approach.In this work we explore the potential of deep learning (DL) for accurate scatter correction in PET imaging, accounting for all scatter coincidences. We propose a network based on a U-Net convolutional neural network architecture with 5 convolutional layers. The network takes as input the emission and computed tomography (CT)-derived attenuation factor (AF) sinograms and returns the estimated scatter sinogram. The network training was performed using MC simulated PET datasets. Multiple anthropomorphic extended cardiac-torso phantoms of two different regions (lung and pelvis) were created, considering three different body sizes and different levels of statistics. In addition, two patient datasets were used to assess the performance of the method in clinical practice.Main results.Our experiments showed that the accuracy of our method, namely DL-based scatter estimation (DLSE), was independent of the anatomical region (lungs or pelvis). They also showed that the DLSE-corrected images were similar to that reconstructed from scatter-free data and more accurate than SSS-corrected images.Significance.The proposed method is able to estimate scatter sinograms from emission and attenuation data. It has shown a better accuracy than the SSS, while being faster than MC scatter estimation methods.

TITLE: Reduced count pediatric whole-body 18F-FDG PET imaging reconstruction with a Bayesian penalized likelihood algorithm

AUTHORS: Vinicius de Padua V Alves, Nadeen Abu Ata, Joseph MacLean, Susan E Sharp, Yinan Li, Samuel Brady, Andrew T Trout

JOURNAL: Pediatric radiology

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Background: Advanced positron emission tomography (PET) image reconstruction methods promise to allow optimized PET/CT protocols with improved image quality, decreased administered activity and/or acquisition times.

Objective: To evaluate the impact of reducing counts (simulating reduced acquisition time) in block sequential regularized expectation maximization (BSREM) reconstructed pediatric whole-body18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET images, and to compare BSERM with ordered-subset expectation maximization (OSEM) reconstructed reduced-count images.

Materials and methods: Twenty children (16 male) underwent clinical whole-body18F-FDG PET/CT examinations using a 25-cm axial field-of-view (FOV) digital PET/CT system at 90 s per bed (s/bed) with BSREM reconstruction (β=700). Reduced count simulations with varied BSREM β levels were generated from list-mode data: 60 s/bed, β=800; 50 s/bed, β=900; 40 s/bed, β=1000; and 30 s/bed, β=1300. In addition, a single OSEM reconstruction was created at 60 s/bed based on prior literature. Qualitative (Likert scores) and quantitative (standardized uptake value [SUV]) analyses were performed to evaluate image quality and quantitation across simulated reconstructions.

Results: The mean patient age was 9.0 ± 5.5 (SD) years, mean weight was 38.5 ± 24.5 kg, and mean administered18F-FDG activity was 4.5 ± 0.7 (SD) MBq/kg. Between BSREM reconstructions, no qualitative measure showed a significant difference versus the 90 s/bed β=700 standard (all P>0.05). SUVmaxvalues for lesions were significantly lower from 90 s/bed, β=700 only at a simulated acquisition time of 30 s/bed, β=1300 (P=0.001). In a side-by-side comparison of BSREM versus OSEM reconstructions, 40 s/bed, β=1000 images were generally preferred over 60 s/bed TOF OSEM images.

Conclusion: In children who undergo whole-body18F-FDG PET/CT on a 25-cm FOV digital PET/CT scanner, reductions in acquisition time or, by corollary, administered radiopharmaceutical activity of >50% from a clinical standard of 90 s/bed may be possible while maintaining diagnostic quality when a BSREM reconstruction algorithm is used.

TITLE: Hierarchical Organ-Aware Total-Body Standard-Dose PET Reconstruction From Low-Dose PET and CT Images

AUTHORS: Jiadong Zhang, Zhiming Cui, Caiwen Jiang, Shanshan Guo, Fei Gao, Dinggang Shen

JOURNAL: IEEE transactions on neural networks and learning systems

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Positron emission tomography (PET) is an important functional imaging technology in early disease diagnosis. Generally, the gamma ray emitted by standard-dose tracer inevitably increases the exposure risk to patients. To reduce dosage, a lower dose tracer is often used and injected into patients. However, this often leads to low-quality PET images. In this article, we propose a learning-based method to reconstruct total-body standard-dose PET (SPET) images from low-dose PET (LPET) images and corresponding total-body computed tomography (CT) images. Different from previous works focusing only on a certain part of human body, our framework can hierarchically reconstruct total-body SPET images, considering varying shapes and intensity distributions of different body parts. Specifically, we first use one global total-body network to coarsely reconstruct total-body SPET images. Then, four local networks are designed to finely reconstruct head-neck, thorax, abdomen-pelvic, and leg parts of human body. Moreover, to enhance each local network learning for the respective local body part, we design an organ-aware network with a residual organ-aware dynamic convolution (RO-DC) module by dynamically adapting organ masks as additional inputs. Extensive experiments on 65 samples collected from uEXPLORER PET/CT system demonstrate that our hierarchical framework can consistently improve the performance of all body parts, especially for total-body PET images with PSNR of 30.6 dB, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods in SPET image reconstruction.

TITLE: Deep learning image enhancement algorithms in PET/CT imaging: a phantom and sarcoma patient radiomic evaluation

AUTHORS: L M Bonney, G M Kalisvaart, F H P van Velden, K M Bradley, A B Hassan, W Grootjans, D R McGowan

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: PET/CT imaging data contains a wealth of quantitative information that can provide valuable contributions to characterising tumours. A growing body of work focuses on the use of deep-learning (DL) techniques for denoising PET data. These models are clinically evaluated prior to use, however, quantitative image assessment provides potential for further evaluation. This work uses radiomic features to compare two manufacturer deep-learning (DL) image enhancement algorithms, one of which has been commercialised, against 'gold-standard' image reconstruction techniques in phantom data and a sarcoma patient data set (N=20).

Methods: All studies in the retrospective sarcoma clinical [F]FDG dataset were acquired on either a GE Discovery 690 or 710 PET/CT scanner with volumes segmented by an experienced nuclear medicine radiologist. The modular heterogeneous imaging phantom used in this work was filled with [F]FDG, and five repeat acquisitions of the phantom were acquired on a GE Discovery 710 PET/CT scanner. The DL-enhanced images were compared to 'gold-standard' images the algorithms were trained to emulate and input images. The difference between image sets was tested for significance in 93 international biomarker standardisation initiative (IBSI) standardised radiomic features.

Results: Comparing DL-enhanced images to the 'gold-standard', 4.0% and 9.7% radiomic features measured significantly different (pcritical< 0.0005) in the phantom and patient data respectively (averaged over the two DL algorithms). Larger differences were observed comparing DL-enhanced images to algorithm input images with 29.8% and 43.0% of radiomic features measuring significantly different in the phantom and patient data respectively (averaged over the two DL algorithms).

Conclusion: DL-enhanced images were found to be similar to images generated using the 'gold-standard' target image reconstruction method with more than 80% of radiomic features not significantly different in all comparisons across unseen phantom and sarcoma patient data. This result offers insight into the performance of the DL algorithms, and demonstrate potential applications for DL algorithms in harmonisation for radiomics and for radiomic features in quantitative evaluation of DL algorithms.

ABSTRACT:
Background: Machine learning (ML) is considered an important technology for future data analysis in health care.

Methods: The inherently technology-driven fields of diagnostic radiology and nuclear medicine will both benefit from ML in terms of image acquisition and reconstruction. Within the next few years, this will lead to accelerated image acquisition, improved image quality, a reduction of motion artifacts and - for PET imaging - reduced radiation exposure and new approaches for attenuation correction.

TITLE: Motion correction of respiratory-gated PET images using deep learning based image registration framework

AUTHORS: Tiantian Li, Mengxi Zhang, Wenyuan Qi, Evren Asma, Jinyi Qi

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Artifacts caused by patient breathing and movement during PET data acquisition affect image quality. Respiratory gating is commonly used to gate the list-mode PET data into multiple bins over a respiratory cycle. Non-rigid registration of respiratory-gated PET images can reduce motion artifacts and preserve count statistics, but it is time consuming. In this work, we propose an unsupervised non-rigid image registration framework using deep learning for motion correction. Our network uses a differentiable spatial transformer layer to warp the moving image to the fixed image and uses a stacked structure for deformation field refinement. Estimated deformation fields were incorporated into an iterative image reconstruction algorithm to perform motion compensated PET image reconstruction. We validated the proposed method using simulation and clinical data and implemented an iterative image registration approach for comparison. Motion compensated reconstructions were compared with ungated images. Our simulation study showed that the motion compensated methods can generate images with sharp boundaries and reveal more details in the heart region compared with the ungated image. The resulting normalized root mean square error (NRMS) was 24.3 ± 1.7% for the deep learning based motion correction, 31.1 ± 1.4% for the iterative registration based motion correction, and 41.9 ± 2.0% for ungated reconstruction. The proposed deep learning based motion correction reduced the bias compared with the ungated image without increasing the noise level and outperformed the iterative registration based method. In the real data study, both motion compensated images provided higher lesion contrast and sharper liver boundaries than the ungated image and had lower noise than the reference gate image. The contrast of the proposed method based on the deep neural network was higher than the ungated image and iterative registration method at any matched noise level.

TITLE: Deep denoiser prior driven relaxed iterated Tikhonov method for low-count PET image restoration

AUTHORS: Weike Chang, Nicola D'Ascenzo, Emanuele Antonecchia, Bingxuan Li, Jigang Yang, Dengyun Mu, Ang Li, Qingguo Xie

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Objective. Low-count positron emission tomography (PET) imaging is an efficient way to promote more widespread use of PET because of its short scan time and low injected activity. However, this often leads to low-quality PET images with clinical image reconstruction, due to high noise and blurring effects. Existing PET image restoration (IR) methods hinder their own restoration performance due to the semi-convergence property and the lack of suitable denoiser prior.Approach. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel deep plug-and-play IR method called Deep denoiser Prior driven Relaxed Iterated Tikhonov method (DP-RI-Tikhonov). Specifically, we train a deep convolutional neural network denoiser to generate a flexible deep denoiser prior to handle high noise. Then, we plug the deep denoiser prior as a modular part into a novel iterative optimization algorithm to handle blurring effects and propose an adaptive parameter selection strategy for the iterative optimization algorithm.Main results. Simulation results show that the deep denoiser prior plays the role of reducing noise intensity, while the novel iterative optimization algorithm and adaptive parameter selection strategy can effectively eliminate the semi-convergence property. They enable DP-RI-Tikhonov to achieve an average quantitative result (normalized root mean square error, structural similarity) of (0.1364, 0.9574) at the stopping iteration, outperforming a conventional PET IR method with an average quantitative result of (0.1533, 0.9523) and a state-of-the-art deep plug-and-play IR method with an average quantitative result of (0.1404, 0.9554). Moreover, the advantage of DP-RI-Tikhonov becomes more obvious at the last iteration. Experiments on six clinical whole-body PET images further indicate that DP-RI-Tikhonov successfully reduces noise intensity and recovers fine details, recovering sharper and more uniform images than the comparison methods.Significance. DP-RI-Tikhonov's ability to reduce noise intensity and effectively eliminate the semi-convergence property overcomes the limitations of existing methods. This advancement may have substantial implications for other medical IR.

TITLE: 3D multi-modality Transformer-GAN for high-quality PET reconstruction

AUTHORS: Yan Wang, Yanmei Luo, Chen Zu, Bo Zhan, Zhengyang Jiao, Xi Wu, Jiliu Zhou, Dinggang Shen, Luping Zhou

JOURNAL: Medical image analysis

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Positron emission tomography (PET) scans can reveal abnormal metabolic activities of cells and provide favorable information for clinical patient diagnosis. Generally, standard-dose PET (SPET) images contain more diagnostic information than low-dose PET (LPET) images but higher-dose scans can also bring higher potential radiation risks. To reduce the radiation risk while acquiring high-quality PET images, in this paper, we propose a 3D multi-modality edge-aware Transformer-GAN for high-quality SPET reconstruction using the corresponding LPET images and T1 acquisitions from magnetic resonance imaging (T1-MRI). Specifically, to fully excavate the metabolic distributions in LPET and anatomical structural information in T1-MRI, we first use two separate CNN-based encoders to extract local spatial features from the two modalities, respectively, and design a multimodal feature integration module to effectively integrate the two kinds of features given the diverse contributions of features at different locations. Then, as CNNs can describe local spatial information well but have difficulty in modeling long-range dependencies in images, we further apply a Transformer-based encoder to extract global semantic information in the input images and use a CNN decoder to transform the encoded features into SPET images. Finally, a patch-based discriminator is applied to ensure the similarity of patch-wise data distribution between the reconstructed and real images. Considering the importance of edge information in anatomical structures for clinical disease diagnosis, besides voxel-level estimation error and adversarial loss, we also introduce an edge-aware loss to retain more edge detail information in the reconstructed SPET images. Experiments on the phantom dataset and clinical dataset validate that our proposed method can effectively reconstruct high-quality SPET images and outperform current state-of-the-art methods in terms of qualitative and quantitative metrics.

TITLE: Accurate Whole-Brain Image Enhancement for Low-Dose Integrated PET/MR Imaging Through Spatial Brain Transformation

AUTHORS: Zhenxing Huang, Wenbo Li, Yaping Wu, Lin Yang, Yun Dong, Yongfeng Yang, Hairong Zheng, Dong Liang, Meiyun Wang, Zhanli Hu

JOURNAL: IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI) systems can provide precise anatomical and functional information with exceptional sensitivity and accuracy for neurological disorder detection. Nevertheless, the radiation exposure risks and economic costs of radiopharmaceuticals may pose significant burdens on patients. To mitigate image quality degradation during low-dose PET imaging, we proposed a novel 3D network equipped with a spatial brain transform (SBF) module for low-dose whole-brain PET and MR images to synthesize high-quality PET images. The FreeSurfer toolkit was applied to derive the spatial brain anatomical alignment information, which was then fused with low-dose PET and MR features through the SBF module. Moreover, several deep learning methods were employed as comparison measures to evaluate the model performance, with the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity (SSIM) and Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) serving as quantitative metrics. Both the visual results and quantitative results illustrated the effectiveness of our approach. The obtained PSNR and SSIM were 41.96 ± 4.91 dB (p < 0.01) and 0.9654 ± 0.0215 (p < 0.01), which achieved a 19% and 20% improvement, respectively, compared to the original low-dose brain PET images. The volume of interest (VOI) analysis of brain regions such as the left thalamus (PCC = 0.959) also showed that the proposed method could achieve a more accurate standardized uptake value (SUV) distribution while preserving the details of brain structures. In future works, we hope to apply our method to other multimodal systems, such as PET/CT, to assist clinical brain disease diagnosis and treatment.

ABSTRACT:
Positron emission tomography (PET) suffers from limited spatial resolution in current head and neck cancer management. We are building a dual-panel high-resolution PET system to aid the detection of tumor involvement in small lymph nodes ([Formula: see text]10 mm in diameter). The system is based on cadmium zinc telluride (CZT) detectors with cross-strip electrode readout (1 mm anode pitch and 5 mm cathode pitch). One challenge of the dual-panel system is that the limited angular coverage of the imaging volume leads to artifacts in reconstructed images, such as the elongation of lesions. In this work, we leverage a penalized maximum-likelihood (PML) reconstruction for the limited-angle PET system. The dissimilarity between the image to be reconstructed and a prior image from a low-resolution whole-body scanner is penalized. An image-based resolution model is incorporated into the regularization. Computer simulations were used to evaluate the performance of the method. Results demonstrate that the elongation of the 6-mm and 8-mm diameter hot spheres is eliminated with the regularization strength γ being 0.02 or larger. The PML reconstruction yields higher contrast recovery coefficient (CRC) of hot spheres compared to the maximum-likelihood reconstruction, as well as the low-resolution whole-body image, across all hot sphere sizes tested (3, 4, 6, and 8 mm). The method studied in this work provides a way to mitigate the limited-angle artifacts in the reconstruction from limited-angle PET data, making the high-resolution dual-panel dedicated head and neck PET system promising for head and neck cancer management.

TITLE: Optimizing scan time and bayesian penalized likelihood reconstruction algorithm in copper-64 PET/CT imaging: a phantom study

JOURNAL: Biomedical physics & engineering express

ABSTRACT:
Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate Cu-64 PET phantom image quality using Bayesian Penalized Likelihood (BPL) and Ordered Subset Expectation Maximum with point-spread function modeling (OSEM-PSF) reconstruction algorithms. In the BPL, the regularization parameterβwas varied to identify the optimum value for image quality. In the OSEM-PSF, the effect of acquisition time was evaluated to assess the feasibility of shortened scan duration.Methods: A NEMA IEC PET body phantom was filled with known activities of water soluble Cu-64. The phantom was imaged on a PET/CT scanner and was reconstructed using BPL and OSEM-PSF algorithms. For the BPL reconstruction, variousβvalues (150, 250, 350, 450, and 550) were evaluated. For the OSEM-PSF algorithm, reconstructions were performed using list-mode data intervals ranging from 7.5 to 240 s. Image quality was assessed by evaluating the signal to noise ratio (SNR), contrast to noise ratio (CNR), and background variability (BV).Results: The SNR and CNR were higher in images reconstructed with BPL compared to OSEM-PSF. Both the SNR and CNR increased with increasingβ, peaking atβ= 550. The CNR for allβ, sphere sizes and tumor-to-background ratios (TBRs) satisfied the Rose criterion for image detectability (CNR > 5). BPL reconstructed images withβ= 550 demonstrated the highest improvement in image quality. For OSEM-PSF reconstructed images with list-mode data duration ≥ 120 s, the noise level and CNR were not significantly different from the baseline 240 s list-mode data duration.Conclusions: BPL reconstruction improved Cu-64 PET phantom image quality by increasing SNR and CNR relative to OSEM-PSF reconstruction. Additionally, this study demonstrated scan time can be reduced from 240 to 120 s when using OSEM-PSF reconstruction while maintaining similar image quality. This study provides baseline data that may guide future studies aimed to improve clinical Cu-64 imaging.

TITLE: HyperTDP-Net: A Hyper-densely Connected Compression-and-Decomposition Network Based on Trident Dilated Perception for PET and MRI Image Fusion

AUTHORS: Bicao Li, Yifan Du, Bei Wang, Zhuhong Shao, Jie Huang, Miaomiao Wei, Jiaxi Lu

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Objective. Since medical images generated by medical devices have low spatial resolution and quality, fusion approaches on medical images can generate a fused image containing a more comprehensive range of different modal features to help physicians accurately diagnose diseases. Conventional methods based on deep learning for medical image fusion usually extract only local features without considering their global features, which often leads to the problem of unclear detail information in the final fused image. Therefore, medical image fusion is a challenging task of great relevance.Approach.This paper proposes a novel end-to-end medical image fusion model for PET and MRI images to achieve information interaction between different pathways, termed as hyper-densely connected compression-and-decomposition network based on trident dilated perception for PET and MRI image fusion (HyperTDP-Net). In particular, in the compression network, a dual residual hyper densely module is constructed to take full advantage of middle layer information. Moreover, we establish the trident dilated perception module to precisely determine the location information of features, and improve the feature representation capability of the network. In addition, we abandon the ordinary mean square error as the content loss function and propose a new content-aware loss consisting of structural similarity loss and gradient loss, so that the fused image not only contains rich texture details but also maintains sufficient structural similarity with the source images.Main results. The experimental dataset used in this paper is derived from multimodal medical images published by Harvard Medical School. Extensive experiments illustrate that our model contains more edge information and texture detail information in the fusion result than the 12 state-of-the-art fusion models and ablation study results demonstrate the effectiveness of three technical innovations.Significance. As medical images continue to be used in clinical diagnosis, our method is expected to be a tool that can effectively improve the accuracy of physician diagnosis and automatic machine detection.

TITLE: Total Body PET/CT: Future Aspects

AUTHORS: Felipe Godinez, Clemens Mingels, Reimund Bayerlein, Brahim Mehadji, Lorenzo Nardo

JOURNAL: Seminars in nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Total-body (TB) positron emission tomography (PET) scanners are classified by their axial field of view (FOV). Long axial field of view (LAFOV) PET scanners can capture images from eyes to thighs in a one-bed position, covering all major organs with an axial FOV of about 100 cm. However, they often miss essential areas like distal lower extremities, limiting their use beyond oncology.TB-PET is reserved for scanners with a FOV of 180 cm or longer, allowing coverage of most of the body. LAFOV PET technology emerged about 40 years ago but gained traction recently due to advancements in data acquisition and cost. Early research highlighted its benefits, leading to the first FDA-cleared TB-PET/CT device in 2019 at UC Davis. Since then, various LAFOV scanners with enhanced capabilities have been developed, improving image quality, reducing acquisition times, and allowing for dynamic imaging. The uEXPLORER, the first LAFOV scanner, has a 194 cm active PET AFOV, far exceeding traditional scanners. The Panorama GS and others have followed suit in optimizing FOVs. Despite slow adoption due to the COVID pandemic and costs, over 50 LAFOV scanners are now in use globally. This review explores the future of LAFOV technology based on recent literature and experiences, covering its clinical applications, implications for radiation oncology, challenges in managing PET data, and expectations for technological advancements.

TITLE: Multi-angle acquisition and 3D composite reconstruction for organ-targeted PET using planar detectors

AUTHORS: Anirudh Shahi, Harutyun Poladyan, Edward Anashkin, Borys Komarov, Brandon Baldassi, Madeline Rapley, Alexey Babich, Oleksandr Bubon, Alla Reznik

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Background: This study investigates a multi-angle acquisition method aimed at improving image quality in organ-targeted PET detectors with planar detector heads. Organ-targeted PET technologies have emerged to address limitations of conventional whole-body PET/CT systems, such as restricted axial field-of-view (AFOV), limited spatial resolution, and high radiation exposure associated with PET procedures. The AFOV in organ-targeted PET can be adjusted to the organ of interest, minimizing unwanted signals from other parts of the body, thus improving signal collection efficiency and reducing the dose of administered radiotracer. However, while planar detector PET technology allows for quasi-3D image reconstruction due to the separation between detector heads, it suffers from degraded axial spatial resolution and, consequently, reduced recovery coefficients (RCs) along the axial direction perpendicular to the detectors.

Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the concept of multi-angle image acquisition with two planar PET detectors and composite full 3D image reconstruction. This leverages data collection from multiple polar angles to improve the axial spatial resolution in the direction perpendicular to the detector heads. In such, the concept allows to overcome the intrinsic limitations of planar detectors in axial resolution.

Methods: This study evaluates the improvement in the quality of images acquired with the Radialis organ-targeted PET camera through multi-angle image acquisition, in both experimental and simulated imaging scenarios. This includes the use of custom-made phantom with fillable spherical hot inserts, the NEMA NU4-2008 image quality (IQ) phantom, and simulations with a digital brain phantom. The analysis involves the comparison of line profiles drawn through the spherical hot inserts, image uniformity, RCs, and the reduction of smearing observed in the axial planes with and without the multi-angle acquisition strategy.

Results: Significant improvements were observed in reducing smearing, enhancing image uniformity, and increasing RCs using the evaluated multi-angle acquisition method. In the composite images, the hot spheres appear more symmetrical in all planes. The image uniformity, calculated from the IQ phantom, improves from 7.79% and 10.98%, as measured in the images from the individual acquisitions, to 2.72% in the composite image. There is also an overall improvement in the RCs as measured from the hot rods of the IQ phantom. Furthermore, the simulation study using the digital human brain phantom demonstrates minimal smearing in the four-angle scan, as opposed to a two-angle scan.

Conclusion: The multi-angle acquisition method offers a promising approach to transform planar PET detector technology into a true tomographic organ-targeted PET system and to enable improvement in image quality while preserving a versatility inherent to planar detector technology. Future research will focus on optimizing the multi-angle imaging protocol, including adjustments to detector separations, number of acquisition angles, and reconstruction iterations, alongside incorporating TOF, and reconstruction with point spread function modeling to further improve image quality.

TITLE: MR-PET head motion correction based on co-registration of multicontrast MR images

AUTHORS: Zhaolin Chen, Francesco Sforazzini, Jakub Baran, Thomas Close, Nadim Jon Shah, Gary F Egan

JOURNAL: Human brain mapping

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Head motion is a major source of image artefacts in neuroimaging studies and can lead to degradation of the quantitative accuracy of reconstructed PET images. Simultaneous magnetic resonance-positron emission tomography (MR-PET) makes it possible to estimate head motion information from high-resolution MR images and then correct motion artefacts in PET images. In this article, we introduce a fully automated PET motion correction method, MR-guided MAF, based on the co-registration of multicontrast MR images. The performance of the MR-guided MAF method was evaluated using MR-PET data acquired from a cohort of ten healthy participants who received a slow infusion of fluorodeoxyglucose ([18-F]FDG). Compared with conventional methods, MR-guided PET image reconstruction can reduce head motion introduced artefacts and improve the image sharpness and quantitative accuracy of PET images acquired using simultaneous MR-PET scanners. The fully automated motion estimation method has been implemented as a publicly available web-service.

JOURNAL: Magnetic resonance in medical sciences : MRMS : an official journal of Japan Society of Magnetic Resonance in Medicine

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Clinical MRI systems have continually improved over the years since their introduction in the 1980s. In MRI technical development, the developments in each MRI system component, including data acquisition, image reconstruction, and hardware systems, have impacted the others. Progress in each component has induced new technology development opportunities in other components. New technologies outside of the MRI field, for example, computer science, data processing, and semiconductors, have been immediately incorporated into MRI development, which resulted in innovative applications. With high performance computing and MR technology innovations, MRI can now provide large volumes of functional and anatomical image datasets, which are important tools in various research fields. MRI systems are now combined with other modalities, such as positron emission tomography (PET) or therapeutic devices. These hybrid systems provide additional capabilities.In this review, MRI advances in the last two decades will be considered. We will discuss the progress of MRI systems, the enabling technology, established applications, current trends, and the future outlook.

TITLE: Motion estimation and correction in SPECT, PET and CT

AUTHORS: Andre Z Kyme, Roger R Fulton

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Patient motion impacts single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), positron emission tomography (PET) and x-ray computed tomography (CT) by giving rise to projection data inconsistencies that can manifest as reconstruction artifacts, thereby degrading image quality and compromising accurate image interpretation and quantification. Methods to estimate and correct for patient motion in SPECT, PET and CT have attracted considerable research effort over several decades. The aims of this effort have been two-fold: to estimate relevant motion fields characterizing the various forms of voluntary and involuntary motion; and to apply these motion fields within a modified reconstruction framework to obtain motion-corrected images. The aims of this review are to outline the motion problem in medical imaging and to critically review published methods for estimating and correcting for the relevant motion fields in clinical and preclinical SPECT, PET and CT. Despite many similarities in how motion is handled between these modalities, utility and applications vary based on differences in temporal and spatial resolution. Technical feasibility has been demonstrated in each modality for both rigid and non-rigid motion but clinical feasibility remains an important target. There is considerable scope for further developments in motion estimation and correction, and particularly in data-driven methods that will aid clinical utility. State-of-the-art deep learning methods may have a unique role to play in this context.

TITLE: Potentials and caveats of AI in hybrid imaging

JOURNAL: Methods (San Diego, Calif.)

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
State-of-the-art patient management frequently mandates the investigation of both anatomy and physiology of the patients. Hybrid imaging modalities such as the PET/MRI, PET/CT and SPECT/CT have the ability to provide both structural and functional information of the investigated tissues in a single examination. With the introduction of such advanced hardware fusion, new problems arise such as the exceedingly large amount of multi-modality data that requires novel approaches of how to extract a maximum of clinical information from large sets of multi-dimensional imaging data. Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as one of the leading technologies that has shown promise in facilitating highly integrative analysis of multi-parametric data. Specifically, the usefulness of AI algorithms in the medical imaging field has been heavily investigated in the realms of (1) image acquisition and reconstruction, (2) post-processing and (3) data mining and modelling. Here, we aim to provide an overview of the challenges encountered in hybrid imaging and discuss how AI algorithms can facilitate potential solutions. In addition, we highlight the pitfalls and challenges in using advanced AI algorithms in the context of hybrid imaging and provide suggestions for building robust AI solutions that enable reproducible and transparent research.

AUTHORS: Elena De Ponti, Cinzia Crivellaro, Sabrina Morzenti, Lavinia Monaco, Sergio Todde, Claudio Landoni, Federica Elisei, Monica Musarra, Luca Guerra

JOURNAL: Current radiopharmaceuticals

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Aims: The aim of this retrospective study was to investigate SUVs variability with respect to lesion size, administered dose, and reconstruction algorithm.

Background: SUVmaxand SUVpeakare influenced by technical factors as count statistics and reconstruction algorithms.

Objective: To fulfill the aim, we evaluated the SUVs variability with respect to lesion size, administered dose, and reconstruction algorithm (ordered - subset expectationmaximization plus point spread function option - OSEM+PSF, regularized Bayesian Penalized Likelihood - BPL) in a 5 - rings BGO PET/CT scanner.

Methods: Discovery IQ scanner (GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, US) was used for list mode acquisition of 25 FDG patients, 12 injected with 3.7 MBq/kg (Standard Dose protocol - SD) and 13 injected with 1.8 MBq/kg (Low Dose protocol - LD). Each acquisition was reconstructed at different time/FOV with both OSEM+PSF algorithm and BPL using seven different beta factors. SUVs were calculated in 70 lesions and analysed in function of time/FOV and Beta. Image quality was evaluated as a coefficient of variation of the liver (CV - liver).

Results: SUVs were not considerably affected by time/FOV. However, SUVs were influenced by beta: differences were higher in small lesions (37% for SUVmax, 15% for SUVpeak) compared to larger ones (14% and 6%). CV - liver ranged from 6% with Beta-500 (LD and SD) to 13% with Beta- 200 (LD). CV - liver of BPL with Beta-350 (optimized for clinical practice in our institution) in LD was lower than CV - liver of OSEM+PSF in SD.

Conclusion: When a high sensitivity 5 - rings BGO PET/CT scanner is used with the same reconstruction algorithm, quantification by means of SUVmaxand SUVpeakis a robust standard compared to the activity and scan duration. However, both SUVs and image quality are influenced by reconstruction algorithms and the related parameters should be considered to obtain the best compromise between detectability, quantification, and noise.

TITLE: Diffusion transformer model with compact prior for low-dose PET reconstruction

AUTHORS: Bin Huang, Xubiao Liu, Lei Fang, Qiegen Liu, Bingxuan Li

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Objective.Positron emission tomography (PET) is an advanced medical imaging technique that plays a crucial role in non-invasive clinical diagnosis. However, while reducing radiation exposure through low-dose PET scans is beneficial for patient safety, it often results in insufficient statistical data. This scarcity of data poses significant challenges for accurately reconstructing high-quality images, which are essential for reliable diagnostic outcomes.Approach.In this research, we propose a diffusion transformer model (DTM) guided by joint compact prior to enhance the reconstruction quality of low-dose PET imaging. In light of current research findings, we present a pioneering PET reconstruction model that integrates diffusion and transformer models for joint optimization. This model combines the powerful distribution mapping abilities of diffusion model with the capacity of transformers to capture long-range dependencies, offering significant advantages for low-dose PET reconstruction. Additionally, the incorporation of the lesion refining block and alternating direction method of multipliers enhance the recovery capability of lesion regions and preserves detail information, solving blurring problems in lesion areas and texture details of most deep learning frameworks.Main results. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of DTM in reconstructing low-dose PET image quality. DTM achieves state-of-the-art performance across various metrics, including PSNR, SSIM, NRMSE, CR, and COV, demonstrating its ability to reduce noise while preserving critical clinical details such as lesion structure and texture. Compared with baseline methods, DTM delivers best results in denoising and lesion preservation across various low-dose levels, including 10%, 25%, 50%, and even ultra-low-dose level such as 1%. DTM shows robust generalization performance on phantom and patient datasets, highlighting its adaptability to varying imaging conditions.Significance. This approach reduces radiation exposure while ensuring reliable imaging for early disease detection and clinical decision-making, offering a promising tool for both clinical and research applications.

ABSTRACT:
We focus on reviewing state-of-the-art developments of dedicated PET scanners with irregular geometries and the potential of different aspects of multifunctional PET imaging. First, we discuss advances in non-conventional PET detector geometries. Then, we present innovative designs of organ-specific dedicated PET scanners for breast, brain, prostate, and cardiac imaging. We will also review challenges and possible artifacts by image reconstruction algorithms for PET scanners with irregular geometries, such as non-cylindrical and partial angular coverage geometries and how they can be addressed. Then, we attempt to address some open issues about cost/benefits analysis of dedicated PET scanners, how far are the theoretical conceptual designs from the market/clinic, and strategies to reduce fabrication cost without compromising performance.

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

ABSTRACT:
Objective. Clinical implementation of in-beam positron emission tomography (PET) monitoring in proton therapy (PT) requires the integration of an online fast and reliable dose calculation engine. This manuscript reports on the achievement of real-time reconstruction of 3D dose and activity maps with proton range verification from experimental in-beam PET measurements.Approach. Several cylindrical homogeneous PMMA phantoms were irradiated with a monoenergetic 70 MeV proton beam in a clinical facility. Additionally, PMMA range-shifting foils of varying thicknesses were placed at the proximal surface of the phantom to investigate range shift prediction capabilities. PET activity was measured using a state-of-the-art in-house developed six-module PET scanner equipped with online PET reconstruction capabilities. For real-time dose estimation, we integrated this system with an in-beam dose estimation algorithm, which combines a graphical processing unit-based 3D reconstruction algorithm with a dictionary-based software, capable of estimating deposited doses from the 3D PET activity images. The range shift prediction performance has been quantitatively studied in terms of the minimum dose to be delivered and the maximum acquisition time.Main results. With this framework, 3D dose maps were accurately reconstructed and displayed with a delay as short as one second. For a dose fraction of 8.4 Gy at the Bragg peak maximum, range shifts as small as 1 mm could be detected. The quantitative analysis shows that accumulating 20 s of statistics from the start of the irradiation, doses down to 1 Gy could be estimated online with total uncertainties smaller than 2 mm.Significance. The hardware and software combination employed in this work can deliver dose maps and accurately predict range shifts after short acquisition times and small doses, suggesting that real-time monitoring and dose reconstruction during PT are within reach. Future work will focus on testing the methodology in more complex clinical scenarios and on upgrading the PET prototype for increased sensitivity.

TITLE: The prevalence of image degradation due to motion in rest-stress rubidium-82 imaging on a SiPM PET-CT system

AUTHORS: Ian S Armstrong, Matthew J Memmott, Charles Hayden, Parthiban Arumugam

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear cardiology : official publication of the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Background: Motion of the heart is known to affect image quality in cardiac PET. The prevalence of motion blurring in routine cardiac PET is not fully appreciated due to challenges identifying subtle motion artefacts. This study utilizes a recent prototype Data-Driven Motion Correction (DDMC) algorithm to generate corrected images that are compared with non-corrected images to identify visual differences in relative rubidium-82 perfusion images due to motion.

Methods: 300 stress and 300 rest static images were reconstructed with DDMC and without correction (NMC). The 600 DDMC/NMC image pairs were assigned Visual Difference Score (VDS). The number of non-diagnostic images were noted. A "Dwell Fraction" (DF) was derived from the data to quantify motion and predict image degradation.

Results: Motion degradation (VDS = 1 or 2) was evident in 58% of stress images and 33% of rest images. Seven NMC images were non-diagnostic-these originated from six studies giving a 2% rate of non-diagnostic studies due to motion. The DF metric was able to effectively predict image degradation. The DDMC heart identification and tracking was successful in all images.

Conclusion: Motion degradation is present in almost half of all relative perfusion images. The DDMC algorithm is a robust tool for predicting, assessing and correcting image degradation.

ABSTRACT:
The purpose of this work was to develop and evaluate a deep learning approach for automatic rat brain image segmentation of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images in a clinical PET/MR, providing a useful tool for analyzing studies of the pathology and progression of neurological disease and to validate new radiotracers and therapeutic agents. Rat brain PET/MR images (N = 56) were collected from a clinical PET/MR system using a dedicated small-animal imaging phased array coil. A segmentation method based on a triple cascaded convolutional neural network (CNN) was developed, where, for a rectangular region of interest covering the whole brain, the entire brain volume was outlined using a CNN, then the outlined brain was fed into the cascaded network to segment both the cerebellum and cerebrum, and finally the sub-cortical structures within the cerebrum including hippocampus, thalamus, striatum, lateral ventricles and prefrontal cortex were segmented out using the last cascaded CNN. The dice score coefficient (DSC) between manually drawn labels and predicted labels were used to quantitatively evaluate the segmentation accuracy. The proposed method achieved a mean DSC of 0.965, 0.927, 0.858, 0.594, 0.847, 0.674 and 0.838 for whole brain, cerebellum, hippocampus, lateral ventricles, striatum, prefrontal cortex and thalamus, respectively. Compared with the segmentation results reported in previous publications using atlas-based methods, the proposed method demonstrated improved performance in the whole brain and cerebellum segmentation. In conclusion, the proposed method achieved high accuracy for rat brain segmentation in MRI images from a clinical PET/MR and enabled the possibility of automatic rat brain image processing for small animal neurological research.

TITLE: Fully Automated Region-Specific Human-Perceptive-Equivalent Image Quality Assessment: Application to 18 F-FDG PET Scans

AUTHORS: Mehdi Amini, Yazdan Salimi, Ghasem Hajianfar, Ismini Mainta, Elsa Hervier, Amirhossein Sanaat, Arman Rahmim, Isaac Shiri, Habib Zaidi

JOURNAL: Clinical nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Introduction: We propose a fully automated framework to conduct a region-wise image quality assessment (IQA) on whole-body 18 F-FDG PET scans. This framework (1) can be valuable in daily clinical image acquisition procedures to instantly recognize low-quality scans for potential rescanning and/or image reconstruction, and (2) can make a significant impact in dataset collection for the development of artificial intelligence-driven 18 F-FDG PET analysis models by rejecting low-quality images and those presenting with artifacts, toward building clean datasets.

Patients and methods: Two experienced nuclear medicine physicians separately evaluated the quality of 174 18 F-FDG PET images from 87 patients, for each body region, based on a 5-point Likert scale. The body regisons included the following: (1) the head and neck, including the brain, (2) the chest, (3) the chest-abdomen interval (diaphragmatic region), (4) the abdomen, and (5) the pelvis. Intrareader and interreader reproducibility of the quality scores were calculated using 39 randomly selected scans from the dataset. Utilizing a binarized classification, images were dichotomized into low-quality versus high-quality for physician quality scores ≤3 versus >3, respectively. Inputting the 18 F-FDG PET/CT scans, our proposed fully automated framework applies 2 deep learning (DL) models on CT images to perform region identification and whole-body contour extraction (excluding extremities), then classifies PET regions as low and high quality. For classification, 2 mainstream artificial intelligence-driven approaches, including machine learning (ML) from radiomic features and DL, were investigated. All models were trained and evaluated on scores attributed by each physician, and the average of the scores reported. DL and radiomics-ML models were evaluated on the same test dataset. The performance evaluation was carried out on the same test dataset for radiomics-ML and DL models using the area under the curve, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity and compared using the Delong test with P values <0.05 regarded as statistically significant.

Results: In the head and neck, chest, chest-abdomen interval, abdomen, and pelvis regions, the best models achieved area under the curve, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of [0.97, 0.95, 0.96, and 0.95], [0.85, 0.82, 0.87, and 0.76], [0.83, 0.76, 0.68, and 0.80], [0.73, 0.72, 0.64, and 0.77], and [0.72, 0.68, 0.70, and 0.67], respectively. In all regions, models revealed highest performance, when developed on the quality scores with higher intrareader reproducibility. Comparison of DL and radiomics-ML models did not show any statistically significant differences, though DL models showed overall improved trends.

Conclusions: We developed a fully automated and human-perceptive equivalent model to conduct region-wise IQA over 18 F-FDG PET images. Our analysis emphasizes the necessity of developing separate models for body regions and performing data annotation based on multiple experts' consensus in IQA studies.

TITLE: Synergistic impact of motion and acquisition/reconstruction parameters on 18 F-FDG PET radiomic features in non-small cell lung cancer: Phantom and clinical studies

AUTHORS: Seyyed Ali Hosseini, Isaac Shiri, Ghasem Hajianfar, Bahador Bahadorzadeh, Pardis Ghafarian, Habib Zaidi, Mohammad Reza Ay

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Objectives: This study is aimed at examining the synergistic impact of motion and acquisition/reconstruction parameters on18F-FDG PET image radiomic features in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, and investigating the robustness of features performance in differentiating NSCLC histopathology subtypes.

Methods: An in-house developed thoracic phantom incorporating lesions with different sizes was used with different reconstruction settings, including various reconstruction algorithms, number of subsets and iterations, full-width at half-maximum of post-reconstruction smoothing filter and acquisition parameters, including injected activity and test-retest with and without motion simulation. To simulate motion, a special motor was manufactured to simulate respiratory motion based on a normal patient in two directions. The lesions were delineated semi-automatically to extract 174 radiomic features. All radiomic features were categorized according to the coefficient of variation (COV) to select robust features. A cohort consisting of 40 NSCLC patients with adenocarcinoma (n = 20) and squamous cell carcinoma (n = 20) was retrospectively analyzed. Statistical analysis was performed to discriminate robust features in differentiating histopathology subtypes of NSCLC lesions.

Results: Overall, 29% of radiomic features showed a COV ≤5% against motion. Forty-five percent and 76% of the features showed a COV ≤ 5% against the test-retest with and without motion in large lesions, respectively. Thirty-three percent and 45% of the features showed a COV ≤ 5% against different reconstruction parameters with and without motion, respectively. For NSCLC histopathological subtype differentiation, statistical analysis showed that 31 features were significant (p-value < 0.05). Two out of the 31 significant features, namely, the joint entropy of GLCM (AUC = 0.71, COV = 0.019) and median absolute deviation of intensity histogram (AUC = 0.7, COV = 0.046), were robust against the motion (same reconstruction setting).

Conclusions: Motion, acquisition, and reconstruction parameters significantly impact radiomic features, just as their synergies. Radiomic features with high predictive performance (statistically significant) in differentiating histopathological subtype of NSCLC may be eliminated due to non-reproducibility.

TITLE: Brain 18F-FDG PET analysis via interval-valued reconstruction: proof of concept for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis

AUTHORS: Florentin Kucharczak, Marie Suau, Olivier Strauss, Fayçal Ben Bouallègue, Denis Mariano-Goulart

JOURNAL: Annals of nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Objective: We propose an innovative approach for18F-FDG PET analysis based on an interval-valued reconstruction of18F-FDG brain distribution. Its diagnostic performance for Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis with comparison to a validated post-processing software was assessed.

Methods: Brain18F-FDG PET data from 26 subjects were acquired in a clinical routine setting. Raw data were reconstructed using an interval-valued version of the ML-EM algorithm called NIBEM that stands for Non-Additive interval-based expectation maximization. Subject classification was obtained via interval-based statistical comparison (intersection ratio, IR) between cortical regions of interest (ROI) including parietal, temporal, and temporo-mesial cortices and a reference region, the sub-cortical grey nuclei, known not to be affected by AD. In parallel, PET images were post-processed using a validated automated software based on the computation of ROI normalized uptake ratios standard deviation (SUVr SD) with reference to a healthy control database (Siemens Scenium). Clinical diagnosis made during follow-up was considered as the gold-standard for patient classification (16 healthy controls and 10 AD patients).

Results: Both methods provided cortical ROI indices that were significantly different between controls and AD patients. The area under the ROC curve for control/AD classification was statistically identical (0.96 for NIBEM IR and 0.95 for Scenium SUVr SD). At the optimal threshold, the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were, respectively, 100%, 88%, 92%, 83%, and 100% for both Scenium SUVr SD and NIBEM IR methods.

Conclusion: This preliminary study shows that interval-valued reconstruction allows self-consistent analysis of brain18F-FDG PET data, yielding diagnostic performances that seem promising with respect to those of a commercial post-processing software based on SUVr SD analysis.

TITLE: RED: Residual estimation diffusion for low-dose PET sinogram reconstruction

AUTHORS: Xingyu Ai, Bin Huang, Fang Chen, Liu Shi, Binxuan Li, Shaoyu Wang, Qiegen Liu

JOURNAL: Medical image analysis

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Recent advances in diffusion models have demonstrated exceptional performance in generative tasks across various fields. In positron emission tomography (PET), the reduction in tracer dose leads to information loss in sinograms. Using diffusion models to reconstruct missing information can improve imaging quality. Traditional diffusion models effectively use Gaussian noise for image reconstructions. However, in low-dose PET reconstruction, Gaussian noise can worsen the already sparse data by introducing artifacts and inconsistencies. To address this issue, we propose a diffusion model named residual estimation diffusion (RED). From the perspective of diffusion mechanism, RED uses the residual between sinograms to replace Gaussian noise in diffusion process, respectively sets the low-dose and full-dose sinograms as the starting point and endpoint of reconstruction. This mechanism helps preserve the original information in the low-dose sinogram, thereby enhancing reconstruction reliability. From the perspective of data consistency, RED introduces a drift correction strategy to reduce accumulated prediction errors during the reverse process. Calibrating the intermediate results of reverse iterations helps maintain the data consistency and enhances the stability of reconstruction process. In the experiments, RED achieved the best performance across all metrics. Specifically, the PSNR metric showed improvements of 2.75, 5.45, and 8.08 dB in DRF4, 20, and 100 respectively, compared to traditional methods. The code is available at: https://github.com/yqx7150/RED.

TITLE: Artificial Intelligence for Optimization and Interpretation of PET/CT and PET/MR Images

AUTHORS: Greg Zaharchuk, Guido Davidzon

JOURNAL: Seminars in nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Artificial intelligence (AI) has recently attracted much attention for its potential use in healthcare applications. The use of AI to improve and extract more information out of medical images, given their parallels with natural images and the immense progress in the area of computer vision, has been at the forefront of these advances. This is due to a convergence of factors, including the increasing numbers of scans performed, the availability of open source AI tools, and decreases in the costs of hardware required to implement these technologies. In this article, we review the progress in the use of AI toward optimizing PET/CT and PET/MRI studies. These two methods, which combine molecular information with structural and (in the case of MRI) functional imaging, are extremely valuable for a wide range of clinical indications. They are also tremendously data-rich modalities and as such are highly amenable to data-driven technologies such as AI. The first half of the article will focus on methods to improve PET reconstruction and image quality, which has multiple benefits including faster image acquisition, image reconstruction, and lower or even "zero" radiation dose imaging. It will also address the value of AI-driven methods to perform MR-based attenuation correction. The second half will address how some of these advances can be used to perform to optimize diagnosis from the acquired images, with examples given for whole-body oncology, cardiology, and neurology indications. Overall, it is likely that the use of AI will markedly improve both the quality and safety of PET/CT and PET/MRI as well as enhance our ability to interpret the scans and follow lesions over time. This will hopefully lead to expanded clinical use cases for these valuable technologies leading to better patient care.

ABSTRACT:
Quantitative values of positron emission tomography (PET) images using non-local-mean in a silicon photomultiplier (SiPM)-PET/computed tomography (CT) system with phantom and clinical images. The evaluation was conducted on a National Electrical Manufacturers Association body phantom with micro-spheres (4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 13 mm) and clinical images using the SiPM-PET/CT system. The signal-to-background ratio of the phantom was set to 4, and all PET image data was obtained and reconstructed using three-dimensional ordered subset expectation maximization, time-of-flight, point-spread function, and a 4-mm Gaussian filter (GF) and clear adaptive low-noise method (CaLM) in mild, standard, and strong intensities. The evaluation included the standardized uptake value (SUV), percent contrast (QH), coefficient of variation of the background area (CVbackground) clinical imaging for SUV of lung nodules, liver signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and visual evaluation. SUVmaxfor 8-mm sphere in phantom images at 2 min for GF and CaLM (mild, standard, strong) were 2.11, 2.32, 2.02, and 1.72; the QH, 8 mmwas 27.33 %, 27.47 %, 21.81 %, and 16.09 %; and CVbackgroundwas 12.78, 11.35, 7.86, and 4.71, respectively. CaLM demonstrated higher SUVmaxin clinical images than GF for all lung nodule sizes. The average SUVmaxfor nodules with a diameter of ≤ 1 cm were 5.9 ± 2.4, 9.9 ± 4.9, 9.9 ± 5.0, and 9.9 ± 5.0 for GF and CaLM-mild, standard, and strong intensities, respectively. Liver SNRs were higher for CaLM (mild, standard, strong) compared to GF, with increasing CaLM intensity causing higher liver SNR. CaLM-mild and standard demonstrated suitability for diagnosis in visual evaluation.

TITLE: Added Value of Respiratory Gating in Positron Emission Tomography for the Clinical Management of Lung Cancer Patients

AUTHORS: Willem Grootjans, Daphne D D Rietbergen, Floris H P van Velden

JOURNAL: Seminars in nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Positron emission tomography (PET) is an important imaging modality for personalizing clinical management of patients with lung cancer. In this regard, PET imaging is essential for adequate clinical staging and monitoring of treatment response in patients with lung cancer. The key advantage of PET over other radiological imaging modalities is its high sensitivity for the detection of pulmonary lesions, normal-sized metastatic hilar and/or mediastinal lymph nodes, and distant metastases. Furthermore, with increasing clinical evidence, the role of PET imaging for treatment selection, adaptation, early response monitoring and follow up in patients with lung cancer is being increasingly recognized. At the heart of PET imaging lies the ability to visualize and quantify numerous biological parameters that are responsible for treatment resistance. In order to ensure accurate and reproducible image quantification, harmonization of patient preparation and imaging protocols is essential. Additionally, there are several technical factors during PET scanning that have to be taken care of to safeguard image quality and quantitative accuracy. One of these factors is the occurrence of respiratory motion artifacts, which is a well-known factor that can significantly influence image quality and quantitative accuracy of PET images. If left uncorrected, respiratory motion artifacts can introduce uncertainties in diagnosis and staging, inaccuracies in definition of target volumes for radiation treatment planning, and hinder adequate monitoring of therapy response. Although many different respiratory gating techniques have been developed to correct PET images for respiratory motion artifacts, respiratory gating has traditionally not been widely adopted in clinical practice. This is due to the fact that these methods tend to be disruptive for the clinical workflow due the lengthening of image acquisition times, higher amounts of activity being administered to the patient, and the requirement to synchronize additional hardware with the scanner. Developments in respiratory gating techniques over the last years have resulted in considerable technical improvements. These newer respiratory gating techniques can operate directly on the acquired PET data without the use of additional hardware to trace respiratory motion and can be seamlessly applied into clinical routine. Furthermore, instead of only using a fraction of the acquired PET data newer methods have the ability to use all of the acquired PET data for image reconstruction, thereby improving image quality. The clinically added value of respiratory gating lies in improving image quality by reducing the amount of respiration-induced image blurring. This considerably improves the detection and characterization of small lesions, potentially improving early diagnosis and staging of patients with lung cancer. Furthermore, the incorporation of (4D) respiratory gated PET for radiotherapy purposes has shown to improve target volume definition through more accurate tracking of tumor motion. In addition, the effect of respiratory motion artifacts on widely used volumetric and uptake parameters in PET have been described. Although respiratory gating improves quantitative accuracy of PET images, the exact impact of these corrections on clinical management of patients with lung cancer often still needs to be determined.

TITLE: PET Mapping of Receptor Occupancy Using Joint Direct Parametric Reconstruction

AUTHORS: Thibault Marin, Vasily Belov, Yanis Chemli, Jinsong Ouyang, Yassir Najmaoui, Georges El Fakhri, Sridhar Duvvuri, Philip Iredale, Nicolas J Guehl, Marc D Normandin, Yoann Petibon

JOURNAL: IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Receptor occupancy (RO) studies using PET neuroimaging play a critical role in the development of drugs targeting the central nervous system (CNS). The conventional approach to estimate drug receptor occupancy consists in estimation of binding potential changes between two PET scans (baseline and post-drug injection). This estimation is typically performed separately for each scan by first reconstructing dynamic PET scan data before fitting a kinetic model to time activity curves. This approach fails to properly model the noise in PET measurements, resulting in poor RO estimates, especially in low receptor density regions.

Objective: In this work, we evaluate a novel joint direct parametric reconstruction framework to directly estimate distributions of RO and other kinetic parameters in the brain from a pair of baseline and post-drug injection dynamic PET scans.

Methods: The proposed method combines the use of regularization on RO maps with alternating optimization to enable estimation of occupancy even in low binding regions.

Results: Simulation results demonstrate the quantitative improvement of this method over conventional approaches in terms of accuracy and precision of occupancy. The proposed method is also evaluated in preclinical in-vivo experiments using 11C-MK-6884 and a muscarinic acetylcholine receptor 4 positive allosteric modulator drug, showing improved estimation of receptor occupancy as compared to traditional estimators.

Conclusion: The proposed joint direct estimation framework improves RO estimation compared to conventional methods, especially in intermediate to low-binding regions.

Significance: This work could potentially facilitate the evaluation of new drug candidates targeting the CNS.

TITLE: Improving patient specific quality assurance for image registration: clinical use case of target contouring for PET deformable image registration

AUTHORS: Johnson Yuen, Joel Poder, Michael Jameson, Laurel Schmidt, Ryan Brown, Charlotte Atkinson, Shrikant Deshpande, Anna Ralston, Lois Holloway

JOURNAL: Physical and engineering sciences in medicine

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Deformable image registration (DIR) has proven to be an invaluable tool to maximize the clinical benefits of multimodality imaging in radiation oncology. In contrast to rigid image registration (RIR), which is employed at all stages of diagnosis and treatment, the uptake of DIR has been constrained by concerns over the potential for unsafe use. The AAPM Task Group 132 (TG132) published a report on the use of image registration, including many recommendations on clinical integration of registration in treatment planning and delivery. There is a remaining uncertainty on incorporating registration uncertainties into treatment margins (Sect. 6.A, TG 132), a challenge in clinical practice. The aim of this work was to report our experience in implementing a practical, patient specific quality assurance process based on the AAPM Task Group 132 report recommendations. This work includes refining our process of target contouring using PET with deformable image registration based on our experience of addressing vulnerabilities identified during implementation. A multidisciplinary team created a flowchart for patient specific quality assurance for image registration (RIR or DIR) based on use cases defined in the AAPM TG132 Report on the use of image registration in radiotherapy. Vulnerabilities identified from this implementation were assessed relative to AAPM TG132 recommendations. These findings were used to adapt our patient specific quality assurance to mitigate vulnerabilities. The main vulnerabilities were identified in the last steps of image registration. There was potential for inappropriate use of the registration for clinical use, such as target contouring where the image registration accuracy level was poor. Vulnerabilities were addressed by an adaptation in our quality assurance process. A new physics image registration QA task was introduced that independently checks registration accuracy and appropriateness of target contouring, addressing the vulnerability in the last steps of the AAPM TG132 flowchart. A multi-disciplinary team implemented the image registration process outlined by AAPM TG132. An improved patient specific quality assurance process was developed by introducing an independent physics image registration review that considers the acceptable registration uncertainty for the specific clinical use case in question.

AUTHORS: Kenta Miwa, Kei Wagatsuma, Reo Nemoto, Masaki Masubuchi, Yuto Kamitaka, Tensho Yamao, Seiya Hiratsuka, Masashi Yamaguchi, Tokiya Yoshii, Rinya Kobayashi, Noriaki Miyaji, Kenji Ishii

JOURNAL: Annals of nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Objective: Many advances in PET/CT technology can potentially improve image quality and the ability to detect small lesions. A new digital TOF-PET/CT scanner based on silicon photomultipliers (SiPM) integrated with a Bayesian penalized likelihood (BPL) PET reconstruction algorithm (Q.Clear; GE Healthcare) has been introduced into clinical practice. The present study aimed to quantify the ability of a digital TOF-PET/CT scanner combined with BPL reconstruction to detect small lesions, and to determine the optimal penalization factor (β) in BPL to accurately detect such lesions.

Methods: All PET data were acquired from a NEMA body phantom using a Discovery MI (DMI) PET/CT system (GE Healthcare). The phantom included six spheres with diameters of 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, and 13 mm, and contained a background activity level of 5.3 kBq/mL, with target-to-background ratios (TBR) of 4:1 and 8:1. Images were reconstructed using a baseline OSEM algorithm, with OSEM + PSF, OSEM + TOF, OSEM + PSF + TOF, and BPL + PSF + TOF (β: 50-400). The matrix size was 192 × 192 and 384 × 384. Data acquired in 100-min list mode were re-binned into acquisition times ranging from 2 to 100 min. The quantitative accuracy and detectability of small hot spheres were evaluated by physical assessment of a recovery coefficient (RC) and a detectability index (DI), as well as visual assessment of PET images at each acquisition time.

Results: The RC and DI of sub-centimeter spheres were improved, because the digital TOF-PET/CT scanner has a larger TOF performance gain due to better timing resolution. The RC and DI were higher with BPL in sub-centimeter spheres, than with other OSEM-based types of reconstruction. The BPL for an 8-mm sphere overestimated uptake due to edge artifact overshoot induced by PSF modeling. The variability of RC and DI for acquisition times and TBR differed considerably according to β values. The RC for ~ 8-mm spheres were > 1 at β values between 50 and 100, but were close to 1 at β value of 200. The visual scores for β = 200 in BPL were maximal, whereas those for spheres that were ≥ 6 mm exceeded the criterion of 3.

Conclusion: The BPL in the digital TOF-PET/CT scanner improved the quantitation and detectability of sub-centimeter spheres compared with OSEM-based reconstruction. Optimization of the β value in BPL might allow the detection of lesions ≤ 6 mm, although detectability depended on the TBR of lesions. A β value of 200 seemed optimal for detecting sub-centimeter lesions.

TITLE: Attenuation correction for human PET/MRI studies

AUTHORS: Ciprian Catana

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Attenuation correction has been one of the main methodological challenges in the integrated positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI) field. As standard transmission or computed tomography approaches are not available in integrated PET/MRI scanners, MR-based attenuation correction approaches had to be developed. Aspects that have to be considered for implementing accurate methods include the need to account for attenuation in bone tissue, normal and pathological lung and the MR hardware present in the PET field-of-view, to reduce the impact of subject motion, to minimize truncation and susceptibility artifacts, and to address issues related to the data acquisition and processing both on the PET and MRI sides. The standard MR-based attenuation correction techniques implemented by the PET/MRI equipment manufacturers and their impact on clinical and research PET data interpretation and quantification are first discussed. Next, the more advanced methods, including the latest generation deep learning-based approaches that have been proposed for further minimizing the attenuation correction related bias are described. Finally, a future perspective focused on the needed developments in the field is given.

TITLE: Improvement of CNR in low-count PET scans using tissue-scattered data as initial estimate in non-TOF MLEM reconstruction

AUTHORS: Satyajit Ghosh, Pragya Das

JOURNAL: Biomedical physics & engineering express

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
We have proposed a method to improve contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs) of lesions in low-count PET scans using the rejected single scattered (inside tissue) data. Indeed, with the advent of high-quality detectors regarding their energy and time resolution, and list mode data acquisition, adding single scattered events by estimating their original line of response has become more and more feasible. The low-count PET scan data were simulated using GATE software considering Jaszczak type object, and images were reconstructed using STIR. A deconvolution based method to create images from rejected single scatter data has been proposed. These scatter images were, in turn, used as an initial estimate in non-TOF MLEM reconstruction. Three types of human-sized PET scanners-ideal, state-of-art, and future generation-with different timing and energy resolutions were considered. We found a significant improvement in trade-off between the contrast recovery coefficient (CRC) and coefficient of variation (CoV) for the non-TOF MLEM reconstructed images while comparing with other less computational ways of creating initial estimates. CNR improvements were found for all lesions. The present work demonstrated the beneficial use of tissue-scattered TOF PET events which constitutes a high percentage of data in PET imaging, and rejected in general. Our approach has a potential and scope for further study.

ABSTRACT:
Background: Deep learning, a leading technology in artificial intelligence (AI), has shown remarkable potential in revolutionizing nuclear medicine.

Objective: This review presents recent advancements in deep learning applications, particularly in nuclear medicine imaging, lesion detection, and radiopharmaceutical therapy.

Results: Leveraging various neural network architectures, deep learning has significantly enhanced the accuracy of image reconstruction, lesion segmentation, and diagnosis, improving the efficiency of disease detection and treatment planning. The integration of deep learning with functional imaging techniques such as positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) enable more precise diagnostics, while facilitating the development of personalized treatment strategies. Despite its promising outlook, there are still some limitations and challenges, particularly in model interpretability, generalization across diverse datasets, multimodal data fusion, and the ethical and legal issues faced in its application.

Conclusion: As technological advancements continue, deep learning is poised to drive substantial changes in nuclear medicine, particularly in the areas of precision healthcare, real-time treatment monitoring, and clinical decision-making. Future research will likely focus on overcoming these challenges and further enhancing model transparency, thus improving clinical applicability.

JOURNAL: Physical and engineering sciences in medicine

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
In this study, we aimed to examine the effect of varying β-values in the block sequential regularized expectation maximization (BSREM) algorithm under differing lesion sizes to determine an optimal penalty factor for clinical application. The National Electrical Manufacturers Association phantom and 15 prostate cancer patients were injected with 68Ga-PSMA and scanned using a GE Discovery IQ PET/CT scanner. Images were reconstructed using ordered subset expectation maximization (OSEM) and BSREM with different β-values. Then, the background variability (BV), contrast recovery, signal-to-noise ratio, and lung residual error were measured from the phantom data, and the signal-to-background ratio (SBR) and contrast from the clinical data. The increment of BV using a β-value of 100 was 120.0%, and the decrement of BV using a β-value of 1000 was 40.5% compared to OSEM. As β decreased from 1000 to 100, the [Formula: see text] increased by 59.0% for a sphere with a diameter of 10 mm and 26.4% for a sphere with a diameter of 37 mm. Conversely, [Formula: see text] increased by 140.5% and 29.0% in the smallest and largest spheres, respectively. Furthermore, the Δ[Formula: see text] and Δ[Formula: see text] were - 41.1% and - 36.7%, respectively. In the clinical study, OSEM exhibited the lowest SBR and contrast. When the β-value was reduced from 500 to 100, the SBR and contrast increased by 69.7% and 71.8% in small and 35.6% and 33.0%, respectively, in large lesions. Moreover, the optimal β-value decreased as lesion size decreased. In conclusion, a β-value of 400 is optimal for small lesion reconstruction, while β-values of 600 and 500 are optimal for large lesions in phantom and clinical studies, respectively.

TITLE: Dynamic PET images denoising using spectral graph wavelet transform

AUTHORS: Liqun Yi, Yuxia Sheng, Li Chai, Jingxin Zhang

JOURNAL: Medical & biological engineering & computing

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Positron emission tomography (PET) is a non-invasive molecular imaging method for quantitative observation of physiological and biochemical changes in living organisms. The quality of the reconstructed PET image is limited by many different physical degradation factors. Various denoising methods including Gaussian filtering (GF) and non-local mean (NLM) filtering have been proposed to improve the image quality. However, image denoising usually blurs edges, of which high frequency components are filtered as noises. On the other hand, it is well-known that edges in a PET image are important to detection and recognition of a lesion. Denoising while preserving the edges of PET images remains an important yet challenging problem in PET image processing. In this paper, we propose a novel denoising method with good edge-preserving performance based on spectral graph wavelet transform (SGWT) for dynamic PET images denoising. We firstly generate a composite image from the entire time series, then perform SGWT on the PET images, and finally reconstruct the low graph frequency content to get the denoised dynamic PET images. Experimental results on simulation and in vivo data show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms the GF, NLM and graph filtering methods. Compared with deep learning-based method, the proposed method has the similar denoising performance, but it does not need lots of training data and has low computational complexity.

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Positron emission tomography (PET) plays an increasingly important role in research and clinical applications, catalysed by remarkable technical advances and a growing appreciation of the need for reliable, sensitive biomarkers of human function in health and disease. Over the last 30 years, a large amount of the physics and engineering effort in PET has been motivated by the dominant clinical application during that period, oncology. This has led to important developments such as PET/CT, whole-body PET, 3D PET, accelerated statistical image reconstruction, and time-of-flight PET. Despite impressive improvements in image quality as a result of these advances, the emphasis on static, semi-quantitative 'hot spot' imaging for oncologic applications has meant that the capability of PET to quantify biologically relevant parameters based on tracer kinetics has not been fully exploited. More recent advances, such as PET/MR and total-body PET, have opened up the ability to address a vast range of new research questions, from which a future expansion of applications and radiotracers appears highly likely. Many of these new applications and tracers will, at least initially, require quantitative analyses that more fully exploit the exquisite sensitivity of PET and the tracer principle on which it is based. It is also expected that they will require more sophisticated quantitative analysis methods than those that are currently available. At the same time, artificial intelligence is revolutionizing data analysis and impacting the relationship between the statistical quality of the acquired data and the information we can extract from the data. In this roadmap, leaders of the key sub-disciplines of the field identify the challenges and opportunities to be addressed over the next ten years that will enable PET to realise its full quantitative potential, initially in research laboratories and, ultimately, in clinical practice.

TITLE: The variation of quantitative parameters and Deauville scores with different reconstruction algorithms in FDG PET/CT imaging of lymphoma patients

AUTHORS: Mustafa Genc, Nilufer Yildirim, Nazim Coskun, Elif Ozdemir, Seyda Turkolmez

JOURNAL: Revista espanola de medicina nuclear e imagen molecular..

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Introduction and objectives: 18F-FDG PET with the Deauville score (DS) is a unique semiquantitative method for lymphoma. However, type of standard uptake values (max, mean, and peak) reconstruction algorithms could affect DS. We compared the Bayesian Penalized Likelihood reconstruction algorithm (BPL) with Ordered Subsets Expectation Maximization (OSEM) on quantitative parameters and DS in lymphoma. We investigated the effect of the size of the lymph node on quantitative variation.

Patients and methods: Raw PET data of 255 lymphoma patients were reconstructed separately with Q.Clear (GE Healthcare), a BPL, and SharpIR (GE Healthcare), an OSEM algorithm. In both images, each patient's liver, mediastinal blood pool, and SUVs (SUVmax, SUVmean, and SUVpeak) of a total of 487 lesions selected from the patients were performed. DSmax, DSmean, and DSpeak were compared.

Results: In our study, DS increased significantly with BPL (p < 0.001), and the DS increased to 4-5 in thirty patients evaluated as 1-2-3 with OSEM. It was found that the quantitative values of the lymph nodes increased statistically with BPL (p < 0.001), and the liver from the reference regions were significantly decreased (p < 0.001). In addition, difference in lymph node was independently associated with size of lesion and was significantly more pronounced in small lesions (p < 0.001). The effects of BPL algorithm were more pronounced in SUVmax than in SUVmean and SUVpeak. DS-mean and DS-peak scores were less changed by BPL than DS-max.

Conclusion: Different reconstruction algorithms in FDG PET/CT affect the quantitative evaluation. That variation may affect the change in DS in lymphoma patients, thus affecting patient management.

TITLE: Optimization of penalization function in Bayesian penalized likelihood reconstruction algorithm for [18F]flutemetamol amyloid PET images

AUTHORS: Shohei Fukuda, Kei Wagatsuma, Kenta Miwa, Yu Yakushiji, Yuto Kamitaka, Tensho Yamao, Noriaki Miyaji, Kenji Ishii

JOURNAL: Physical and engineering sciences in medicine

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Point-spread-function (PSF) correction is not recommended for amyloid PET images due to Gibbs artifacts. Q.Clear™, a Bayesian Penalized Likelihood (BPL) reconstruction method without incorporating PSF correction reduces these artifacts but degrades image contrast by our previous findings. The present study aimed to recover lost contrast by optimizing reconstruction parameters in time-of-flight (TOF) BPL reconstruction of amyloid PET images without PSF correction. We selected candidate conditions based on a phantom study and then determined which were optimal in a clinical study. Phantom images were reconstructed under conditions of 1‒9 iterations, β 300-1000 and γ factors from 2 to 10 in TOF-BPL without PSF correction. We evaluated the %contrast and the coefficients of variation (CV, %). Standardized uptake value ratios (SUVr) and Centiloid scales (CL) were calculated from PET images acquired from 71 participants after an [18F]flutemetamol injection. Both %contrast and CV were independent of iterations, whereas a trade-off was found between γ factors and β. We selected a γ factors of 5 without PSF correction (iterations, 1; β, 500) and of 10 without PSF correction (iterations, 1; β, 800) as candidates for clinical investigation. The SUVr and CL remained stable across various conditions, and CL scales effectively discriminated amyloid PET using measured values. The optimal reconstruction parameters of TOF-BPL for [18F]flutemetamol PET images were γ factor 10, iterations 1 and β 800, without PSF correction.

JOURNAL: Computerized medical imaging and graphics : the official journal of the Computerized Medical Imaging Society

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
The amount of radiotracer injected into laboratory animals is still the most daunting challenge facing translational PET studies. Since low-dose imaging is characterized by a higher level of noise, the quality of the reconstructed images leaves much to be desired. Being the most ubiquitous techniques in denoising applications, edge-aware denoising filters, and reconstruction-based techniques have drawn significant attention in low-count applications. However, for the last few years, much of the credit has gone to deep-learning (DL) methods, which provide more robust solutions to handle various conditions. Albeit being extensively explored in clinical studies, to the best of our knowledge, there is a lack of studies exploring the feasibility of DL-based image denoising in low-count small animal PET imaging. Therefore, herein, we investigated different DL frameworks to map low-dose small animal PET images to their full-dose equivalent with quality and visual similarity on a par with those of standard acquisition. The performance of the DL model was also compared to other well-established filters, including Gaussian smoothing, nonlocal means, and anisotropic diffusion. Visual inspection and quantitative assessment based on quality metrics proved the superior performance of the DL methods in low-count small animal PET studies, paving the way for a more detailed exploration of DL-assisted algorithms in this domain.

TITLE: Non-local mean denoising using multiple PET reconstructions

AUTHORS: Hossein Arabi, Habib Zaidi

JOURNAL: Annals of nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Objectives: Non-local mean (NLM) filtering has been broadly used for denoising of natural and medical images. The NLM filter relies on the redundant information, in the form of repeated patterns/textures, in the target image to discriminate the underlying structures/signals from noise. In PET (or SPECT) imaging, the raw data could be reconstructed using different parameters and settings, leading to different representations of the target image, which contain highly similar structures/signals to the target image contaminated with different noise levels (or properties). In this light, multiple-reconstruction NLM filtering (MR-NLM) is proposed, which relies on the redundant information provided by the different reconstructions of the same PET data (referred to as auxiliary images) to conduct the denoising process.

Methods: Implementation of the MR-NLM approach involved the use of twelve auxiliary PET images (in addition to the target image) reconstructed using the same iterative reconstruction algorithm with different numbers of iterations and subsets. For each target voxel, the patches of voxels at the same location are extracted from the auxiliary PET images based on which the NLM denoising process is conducted. Through this, the exhaustive search scheme performed in the conventional NLM method to find similar patches of voxels is bypassed. The performance evaluation of the MR-NLM filter was carried out against the conventional NLM, Gaussian and bilateral post-reconstruction approaches using the experimental Jaszczak phantom and 25 whole-body PET/CT clinical studies.

Results: The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the experimental Jaszczak phantom study improved from 25.1 when using Gaussian filtering to 27.9 and 28.8 when the conventional NLM and MR-NLM methods were applied (p value < 0.05), respectively. Conversely, the Gaussian filter led to quantification bias of 35.4%, while NLM and MR-NLM approaches resulted in a bias of 32.0% and 31.1% (p value < 0.05), respectively. The clinical studies further confirm the superior performance of the MR-NLM method, wherein the quantitative bias measured in malignant lesions (hot spots) decreased from - 12.3 ± 2.3% when using the Gaussian filter to - 3.5 ± 1.3% and - 2.2 ± 1.2% when using the NLM and MR-NLM approaches (p value < 0.05), respectively.

Conclusion: The MR-NLM approach exhibited promising performance in terms of noise suppression and signal preservation for PET images, thus translating into higher SNR compared to the conventional NLM approach. Despite the promising performance of the MR-NLM approach, the additional computational burden owing to the requirement of multiple PET reconstruction still needs to be addressed.

TITLE: IE-CycleGAN: improved cycle consistent adversarial network for unpaired PET image enhancement

AUTHORS: Jianan Cui, Yi Luo, Donghe Chen, Kuangyu Shi, Xinhui Su, Huafeng Liu

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Technological advances in instruments have greatly promoted the development of positron emission tomography (PET) scanners. State-of-the-art PET scanners such as uEXPLORER can collect PET images of significantly higher quality. However, these scanners are not currently available in most local hospitals due to the high cost of manufacturing and maintenance. Our study aims to convert low-quality PET images acquired by common PET scanners into images of comparable quality to those obtained by state-of-the-art scanners without the need for paired low- and high-quality PET images.

Methods: In this paper, we proposed an improved CycleGAN (IE-CycleGAN) model for unpaired PET image enhancement. The proposed method is based on CycleGAN, and the correlation coefficient loss and patient-specific prior loss were added to constrain the structure of the generated images. Furthermore, we defined a normalX-to-advanced training strategy to enhance the generalization ability of the network. The proposed method was validated on unpaired uEXPLORER datasets and Biograph Vision local hospital datasets.

Results: For the uEXPLORER dataset, the proposed method achieved better results than non-local mean filtering (NLM), block-matching and 3D filtering (BM3D), and deep image prior (DIP), which are comparable to Unet (supervised) and CycleGAN (supervised). For the Biograph Vision local hospital datasets, the proposed method achieved higher contrast-to-noise ratios (CNR) and tumor-to-background SUVmax ratios (TBR) than NLM, BM3D, and DIP. In addition, the proposed method showed higher contrast, SUVmax, and TBR than Unet (supervised) and CycleGAN (supervised) when applied to images from different scanners.

Conclusion: The proposed unpaired PET image enhancement method outperforms NLM, BM3D, and DIP. Moreover, it performs better than the Unet (supervised) and CycleGAN (supervised) when implemented on local hospital datasets, which demonstrates its excellent generalization ability.

TITLE: Non-parametric Bayesian deep learning approach for whole-body low-dose PET reconstruction and uncertainty assessment

AUTHORS: Maya Fichmann Levital, Samah Khawaled, John A Kennedy, Moti Freiman

JOURNAL: Medical & biological engineering & computing

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging plays a pivotal role in oncology for the early detection of metastatic tumors and response to therapy assessment due to its high sensitivity compared to anatomical imaging modalities. The balance between image quality and radiation exposure is critical, as reducing the administered dose results in a lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and information loss, which may significantly affect clinical diagnosis. Deep learning (DL) algorithms have recently made significant progress in low-dose (LD) PET reconstruction. Nevertheless, a successful clinical application requires a thorough evaluation of uncertainty to ensure informed clinical judgment. We propose NPB-LDPET, a DL-based non-parametric Bayesian framework for LD PET reconstruction and uncertainty assessment. Our framework utilizes an Adam optimizer with stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD) to sample from the underlying posterior distribution. We employed the Ultra-low-dose PET Challenge dataset to assess our framework's performance relative to the Monte Carlo dropout benchmark. We evaluated global reconstruction accuracy utilizing SSIM, PSNR, and NRMSE, local lesion conspicuity using mean absolute error (MAE) and local contrast, and the clinical relevance of uncertainty maps employing correlation between the uncertainty measures and the dose reduction factor (DRF). Our NPB-LDPET reconstruction method exhibits a significantly superior global reconstruction accuracy for various DRFs (paired t-test,, N=10, 631). Moreover, we demonstrate a 21% reduction in MAE (573.54 vs. 723.70, paired t-test,, N=28) and an 8.3% improvement in local lesion contrast (2.077 vs. 1.916, paired t-test,, N=28). Furthermore, our framework exhibits a stronger correlation between the predicted uncertainty 95th percentile score and the DRF (vs., N=10, 631). The proposed framework has the potential to improve clinical decision-making for LD PET imaging by providing a more accurate and informative reconstruction while reducing radiation exposure.

JOURNAL: European radiology

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Objectives: To compare block sequential regularized expectation maximization (BSREM) and ordered subset expectation maximization (OSEM) for the detection of in-transit metastasis (ITM) of malignant melanoma in digital [18F]FDG PET/CT.

Methods: We retrospectively analyzed a cohort of 100 [18F]FDG PET/CT scans of melanoma patients with ITM, performed between May 2017 and January 2020. PET images were reconstructed with both OSEM and BSREM algorithms. SUVmax, target-to-background ratio (TBR), and metabolic tumor volume (MTV) were recorded for each ITM. Differences in PET parameters were analyzed with the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Differences in image quality for different reconstructions were tested using the Man-Whitney U test.

Results: BSREM reconstruction led to the detection of 287 ITM (39% more than OSEM). PET parameters of ITM were significantly different between BSREM and OSEM reconstructions (p < 0.001). SUVmax and TBR were higher (76.5% and 77.7%, respectively) and MTV lower (49.5%) on BSREM. ITM missed with OSEM had significantly lower SUVmax (mean 2.03 vs. 3.84) and TBR (mean 1.18 vs. 2.22) and higher MTV (mean 2.92 vs. 1.01) on OSEM compared to BSREM (all p < 0.001).

Conclusions: BSREM detects significantly more ITM than OSEM, owing to higher SUVmax, higher TBR, and less blurring. BSREM is particularly helpful in small and less avid lesions, which are more often missed with OSEM.

Key points: • In melanoma patients, [18F]FDG PET/CT helps to detect in-transit metastases (ITM), and their detection is improved by using BSREM instead of OSEM reconstruction. • BSREM is particularly useful in small lesions.

TITLE: Impact of different reconstruction algorithms and setting parameters on radiomics features of PSMA PET images: A preliminary study

AUTHORS: Masoomeh Fooladi, Yunus Soleymani, Arman Rahmim, Saeed Farzanefar, Farahnaz Aghahosseini, Negisa Seyyedi, Peyman Sh Zadeh

JOURNAL: European journal of radiology

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Radiomics analysis of oncologic positron emission tomography (PET) images is an area of significant activity and potential. The reproducibility of radiomics features is an important consideration for routine clinical use. This preliminary study investigates the robustness of radiomics features in PSMA-PET images across penalized-likelihood (Q.Clear) and standard ordered subset expectation maximization (OSEM) reconstruction algorithms and their setting parameters in phantom and prostate cancer (PCa) patients.

Method: A NEMA image quality (IQ) phantom and 8 PCa patients were selected for phantom and patient analyses, respectively. PET images were reconstructed using Q.Clear (reconstruction β-value: 100-700, at intervals of 100 for both NEMA IQ phantom and patients) and OSEM (duration: 15sec, 30sec, 1 min, 2 min, 3 min, 4 min and 5 min for NEMA phantom and duration: 30 s, 1 min and 2 min for patients) reconstruction methods. Subsequently, 129 radiomic features were extracted from the reconstructed images. The coefficient of variation (COV) of each feature across reconstruction methods and their parameters was calculated to determine feature robustness.

Results: The extracted radiomics features showed a different range of variability, depending on the reconstruction algorithms and setting parameters. Specifically, 23.0 % and 53.5 % of features were found as robust against β-value variations in Q.Clear and different durations in OSEM reconstruction algorithms, respectively. Taking into account the two algorithms and their parameters, eleven features (8.5 %) showed COV ≤ 5 % and eighteen (14 %) showed 5 %<COV ≤ 10 %, independent of changes in the methods and parameters. Forty-two (32.5 %) were found with 10 %<COV ≤ 20 %. The remaining fifty-eight features (45 %) showed high variability with COV > 20 %. The mean COVs of the extracted radiomics features were significantly different between the two reconstruction methods (p < 0.05) except for the phantom morphological features.

Conclusions: All radiomics features were affected by reconstruction methods and parameters, but features with small or very small variations are considered better candidates for reproducible quantification of either tumor or metastatic tissues in clinical trials. There is a need for standardization before the implementation of PET radiomics in clinical practice.

TITLE: Application and prospect for generative adversarial networks in cross-modality reconstruction of medical images

AUTHORS: Jie Sun, Shichen Jin, Rong Shi, Chuantao Zuo, Jiehui Jiang

JOURNAL: Zhong nan da xue xue bao. Yi xue ban = Journal of Central South University. Medical sciences

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Cross-modality reconstruction of medical images refers to predicting the image from one modality to another so as to achieve more accurate personalized medicine. Generative adversarial networks is the most commonly used deep learning technique in cross-modality reconstruction. It can generate realistic images by learning features from implicit distributions that follow the distributions of real data and then reconstruct the image of another modality rapidly. With the sharp increase in clinical demand for multi-modality medical image, this technology has been widely used in the task of cross modal reconstruction between different medical image modalities, such as magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography and positron emission computed tomography. It can achieve accurate and efficient cross-modality image reconstruction in different parts of the body, such as the brain, heart, etc. In addition, although GAN has achieved some success in cross-modality reconstruction, its stability, generalization ability, and accuracy still need further research and improvement.

AUTHORS: Filiz Özülker, Gündüzalp Buğrahan Babacan, Safiya Cengiz, Tamer Özülker

JOURNAL: Hellenic journal of nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Objective: This study was carried out to understand whether Q.Clear and ordered subset expectation maximization (OSEM), reconstruction algorithms used in fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) applications, and parameters such as time of flight (TOF) and point spread function (PSF) cause different results in semi-quantitative measurements.

Subjects and methods: Raw PET data of 264 patients who were referred to18F-FDG PET/CT imaging with the purpose of evaluation of known or suspicious malignant disease were reconstructed separately with Q.Clear (GE Healthcare), a BPL, an OSEM algorithm, PSF (SharpIR®) and TOF (VUE Point FX®) methods. Each patient's liver, mediastinal blood pool, metabolic tumor volume (MTV), total lesion glycolysis (TLG), and standardized uptake values (SUV) (SUVmax, SUVmean, and SUVpeak) of a total of 264 lesions selected from the patients were performed.

Results: β350+ToF yielded higher measurement results than all other variables for all of the lesion SUVmax, lesion SUVmean, L/AP SUVmax, and L/AP SUVmean parameters. OSEM+ToF and OSEM+TOF+PSF algorithms yielded higher mean and median SUVmax values for the reference structures (liver and mediastinum) and for lesions SUVmax and SUVmean values were statistically significantly lower than the β350+ToF method. The method with the lowest mean value for the L/Liver SUVmax variable was OSEM+ToF 4iter16ss (mean=1.76), while the method with the highest mean value was β350+ToF (mean=2.26). β350+ToF was the reconstruction method with the highest ratios for L/AP SUVmax and SUVmean for both lesions below and above 1 cm. β350+ToF algorithm had also statistically significantly higher results for these variables compared to all other parameters in malignant lesions.

Conclusion: When comparing18F-FDG PET/CT images, the use of different reconstruction algorithms may lead to misleading results, especially in the evaluation of response to treatment of malignancies.

TITLE: Artificial Intelligence in Nuclear Cardiology: An Update and Future Trends

AUTHORS: Robert J H Miller, Piotr J Slomka

JOURNAL: Seminars in nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI), using either single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) or positron emission tomography (PET), is one of the most commonly ordered cardiac imaging tests, with prominent clinical roles for disease diagnosis and risk prediction. Artificial intelligence (AI) could potentially play a role in many steps along the typical MPI workflow, from image acquisition through to clinical reporting and risk estimation. AI can be utilized to improve image quality, reducing radiation exposure and image acquisition times. Once images are acquired, AI can help optimize motion correction and image registration during image reconstruction or provide direct image attenuation correction. Utilizing these image sets, AI can segment a number of anatomic features from associated computed tomographic imaging or even generate synthetic attenuation imaging. Lastly, AI may play an important role in disease diagnosis or risk prediction by combining the large number of potentially important clinical, stress, and imaging-related variables. This review will focus on the most recent developments in the field, providing clinicians and researchers with a timely update on the field. Additionally, it will discuss future trends including applications of AI during multiple points of the typical MPI workflow to maximize clinical utility and methods to maximize the information that can be obtained from hybrid imaging.

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: A novel phantom-imaging platform, a set of software tools, for automated and high-precision imaging of the American College of Radiology (ACR) positron emission tomography (PET) phantom for PET/magnetic resonance (PET/MR) and PET/computed tomography (PET/CT) systems is proposed.

Methods: The key feature of this platform is the vector graphics design that facilitates the automated measurement of the knife-edge response function and hence image resolution, using composite volume of interest templates in a 0.5 mm resolution grid applied to all inserts of the phantom. Furthermore, the proposed platform enables the generation of an accurate-map for PET/MR systems with a robust alignment based on two-stage image registration using specifically designed PET templates. The proposed platform is based on the open-source NiftyPET software package used to generate multiple list-mode data bootstrap realizations and image reconstructions to determine the precision of the two-stage registration and any image-derived statistics. For all the analyses, iterative image reconstruction was employed with and without modeled shift-invariant point spread function and with varying iterations of the ordered subsets expectation maximization (OSEM) algorithm. The impact of the activity outside the field of view (FOV) was assessed using two acquisitions of 30 min each, with and without the activity outside the FOV.

Results: The utility of the platform has been demonstrated by providing a standard and an advanced phantom analysis including the estimation of spatial resolution using all cylindrical inserts. In the imaging planes close to the edge of the axial FOV, we observed deterioration in the quantitative accuracy, reduced resolution (FWHM increased by 1-2 mm), reduced contrast, and background uniformity due to the activity outside the FOV. Although it slows convergence, the PSF reconstruction had a positive impact on resolution and contrast recovery, but the degree of improvement depended on the regions. The uncertainty analysis based on bootstrap resampling of raw PET data indicated high precision of the two-stage registration.

Conclusions: We demonstrated that phantom imaging using the proposed methodology with the metric of spatial resolution and multiple bootstrap realizations may be helpful in more accurate evaluation of PET systems as well as in facilitating fine tuning for optimal imaging parameters in PET/MR and PET/CT clinical research studies.

TITLE: Practical joint reconstruction of activity and attenuation with autonomous scaling for time-of-flight PET

AUTHORS: Yusheng Li, Samuel Matej, Joel S Karp

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Recent research has showed that attenuation images can be determined from emission data, jointly with activity images, up to a scaling constant when utilizing the time-of-flight (TOF) information. We aim to develop practical CT-less joint reconstruction for clinical TOF PET scanners to obtain quantitatively accurate activity and attenuation images. In this work, we present a joint reconstruction of activity and attenuation based on MLAA (maximum likelihood reconstruction of attenuation and activity) with autonomous scaling determination and joint TOF scatter estimation from TOF PET data. Our idea for scaling is to use a selected volume of interest (VOI) in a reconstructed attenuation image with known attenuation, e.g. a liver in patient imaging. First, we construct a unit attenuation medium which has a similar, though not necessarily the same, support to the imaged emission object. All detectable LORs intersecting the unit medium have an attenuation factor of e-1≈ 0.3679, i.e. the line integral of linear attenuation coefficients is one. The scaling factor can then be determined from the difference between the reconstructed attenuation image and the known attenuation within the selected VOI normalized by the unit attenuation medium. A four-step iterative joint reconstruction algorithm is developed. In each iteration, (1) first the activity is updated using TOF OSEM from TOF list-mode data; (2) then the attenuation image is updated using XMLTR-a extended MLTR from non-TOF LOR sinograms; (3) a scaling factor is determined based on the selected VOI and both activity and attenuation images are updated using the estimated scaling; and (4) scatter is estimated using TOF single scatter simulation with the jointly reconstructed activity and attenuation images. The performance of joint reconstruction is studied using simulated data from a generic whole-body clinical TOF PET scanner and a long axial FOV research PET scanner as well as 3D experimental data from the PennPET Explorer scanner. We show that the proposed joint reconstruction with proper autonomous scaling provides low bias results comparable to the reference reconstruction with known attenuation.

TITLE: Phantom and clinical assessment of small pulmonary nodules using Q.Clear reconstruction on a silicon-photomultiplier-based time-of-flight PET/CT system

AUTHORS: Zhifang Wu, Binwei Guo, Bin Huang, Xinzhong Hao, Ping Wu, Bin Zhao, Zhixing Qin, Jun Xie, Sijin Li

JOURNAL: Scientific reports

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
To evaluate the quantification accuracy of different positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET/CT) reconstruction algorithms, we measured the recovery coefficient (RC) and contrast recovery (CR) in phantom studies. The results played a guiding role in the partial-volume-effect correction (PVC) for following clinical evaluations. The PET images were reconstructed with four different methods: ordered subsets expectation maximization (OSEM), OSEM with time-of-flight (TOF), OSEM with TOF and point spread function (PSF), and Bayesian penalized likelihood (BPL, known as Q.Clear in the PET/CT of GE Healthcare). In clinical studies, SUVmax and SUVmean (the maximum and mean of the standardized uptake values, SUVs) of 75 small pulmonary nodules (sub-centimeter group: < 10 mm and medium-size group: 10-25 mm) were measured from 26 patients. Results show that Q.Clear produced higher RC and CR values, which can improve quantification accuracy compared with other methods (P < 0.05), except for the RC of 37 mm sphere (P > 0.05). The SUVs of sub-centimeter fludeoxyglucose (FDG)-avid pulmonary nodules with Q.Clear illustrated highly significant differences from those reconstructed with other algorithms (P < 0.001). After performing the PVC, highly significant differences (P < 0.001) still existed in the SUVmean measured by Q.Clear comparing with those measured by the other algorithms. Our results suggest that the Q.Clear reconstruction algorithm improved the quantification accuracy towards the true uptake, which potentially promotes the diagnostic confidence and treatment response evaluations with PET/CT imaging, especially for the sub-centimeter pulmonary nodules. For small lesions, PVC is essential.

TITLE: Robustness of 18F-FDG PET Radiomic Features in Lung Cancer: Impact of Advanced Reconstruction Algorithm

AUTHORS: Pooja Dwivedi, Sagar Barage, Ashish Kumar Jha, Sayak Choudhury, Venkatesh Rangarajan

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear medicine technology

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
18F-FDG PET radiomics is emerging as a promising tool to identify imaging biomarkers for quantifying intratumor heterogeneity in lung cancer. However, the robustness of PET radiomic features (RFs) is influenced by factors such as image reconstruction algorithms, tumor segmentation, and discretization. Although the impact of these factors on RFs has been explored, the specific influence of the advanced block sequential regularized expectation maximization (BSREM) reconstruction algorithm remains unclear. This study investigated the potential variations in PET RFs associated with different factors when using BSREM.Methods:Retrospective data of18F-FDG PET from 120 lung cancer patients were reconstructed twice using advanced BSREM and conventional ordered-subset expectation maximization methods. For each reconstruction set, 3 tumor segmentations were performed, including manual, 40% threshold, and Nestle methods. Two discretization methods using absolute and relative settings were applied for each dataset before RF extraction. Stable and robust RFs were assessed by the coefficient of variance and intraclass correlation coefficient, respectively.Results:High instability was exhibited by 19%, 33%, and 36% of RFs, with a coefficient of variation of more than 20% for reconstruction, segmentation, and discretization, respectively. Conversely, 60%, 19%, and 35% of RFs demonstrated robustness against these factors, with an intraclass correlation coefficient of more than 0.90. The comparative evaluation revealed significantly greater robustness for most RF subtypes in BSREM than in ordered-subset expectation maximization under varying segmentation and discretization conditions (P< 0.05).Conclusion:The stability and robustness of PET RFs are enhanced if BSREM is applied rather than the conventional method. Study results suggest that the advanced reconstruction method could offer potential benefits in providing consistent PET-based radiomic analysis for improving diagnostic and prognostic value.

JOURNAL: Scientific reports

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
To evaluate the impact of block sequential regularized expectation maximization (BSREM) reconstruction on quantitative and qualitative aspects of 2-[18F]FDG-avid pulmonary nodules compared to conventional ordered subset expectation maximization (OSEM) reconstruction method. Ninety-one patients with 144 2-[18F]FDG-avid pulmonary nodules (all ≤ 20 mm) undergoing PET/CT for oncological (re-)staging were retrospectively included. Quantitative parameters in BSREM and OSEM (including point spread function modelling) were measured, including maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax). Nodule conspicuity in BSREM and OSEM images was evaluated by two readers. Wilcoxon matched pairs signed-rank test was used to compare quantitative and qualitative parameters in BSREM and OSEM. Pulmonary nodule SUVmaxwas significantly higher in BSREM images compared to OSEM images [BSREM 5.4 (1.2-20.7), OSEM 3.6 (0.7-17.4); p = 0.0001]. In a size-based analysis, the relative increase in SUVmaxwas more pronounced in smaller nodules (≤ 7 mm) as compared to larger nodules (8-10 mm, or > 10 mm). Lesion conspicuity was higher in BSREM than in OSEM (p < 0.0001). BSREM reconstruction results in a significant increase in SUVmaxand a significantly improved conspicuity of small 2-[18F]FDG-avid pulmonary nodules compared to OSEM reconstruction. Digital 2-[18F]FDG-PET/CT reading may be enhanced with BSREM as small lesion conspicuity is improved.

ABSTRACT:
We read with great interest the paper by Limet al(2018Phys. Med. Biol.63035042) on bias reduction in Y-90 PET imaging. In particular, they proposed a new formulation of the tomographic reconstruction problem that enforces non-negativity in projection space as opposed to image space. We comment on the algorithm they derived from this formulation and bring some clarifications on the constraint that this algorithm respects.

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: PSMA-PET is a reference standard examination for patients with prostate cancer, but even using recently introduced digital PET detectors image acquisition with standard field-of-view scanners is still in the range of 20 min. This may cause limited access to examination slots because of the growing demand for PSMA-PET. Ultra-fast PSMA-PET may enhance throughput but comes at the cost of poor image quality. The aim of this manuscript is to evaluate the accuracy of AI-enhanced ultra-fast PSMA-PET for staging of patients with prostate cancer.

Methods: A total number of 357 whole-body [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET datasets were included. Patients underwent two digital PET scans, one at standard and one at ultra-fast speed (table speed: 0.6-1.2 mm/s vs. 50 mm/s). A modified pix2pixHD generative adversarial network to enhance the ultra-fast images was trained with 286 datasets and evaluated with the remaining 71 datasets. The staging accuracy of ultra-fast PSMA-PET and AI-enhanced ultra-fast PET was compared with the reference standard PET separately for miTNM regions proposed by PROMISE V2.0.

Results: The AI-network significantly improved the visual image quality and detection rate in most miTNM regions compared with the non-enhanced image data (T: 69.6% vs. 43.5%, p < 0.05; N: 46.3% vs. 27.8%, p < 0.01; M1a 64.4% vs. 47.5%, p < 0.01; M1b: 85.7% vs. 72.1%, p < 0.01). However, improvement was not significant for the M1c category (42.9 vs. 28.6%, p > 0.05). Missed lesions had a smaller SUVmax and lesion size compared with detected lesions (exemplary for N: 9.5 vs. 26.5 SUVmax; 4 vs. 10 mm). SUVmax values of lesions were significantly different in all miTNM regions between the ultra-fast and reference standard PET, but only in the T-region between the AI-enhanced and reference standard PET.

Conclusion: The AI-based image enhancement improved image quality and region detection rates by a mean of 17.9%. As the sensitivity of synthetic PET for small and low-uptake lesions was limited, a potential clinical use case could be disease monitoring in patients with high tumor volume and PSMA uptake undergoing PSMA radioligand therapy. The improvement in detection rate of distant metastases was not significant. This indicates that more training data is needed to ensure robust results also for lesions that have lower appearance frequency. Future studies on accelerated PSMA-PET seem warranted.

JOURNAL: Magnetic resonance in medicine

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: We evaluated the impact of PET respiratory motion correction (MoCo) in a phantom and patients. Moreover, we proposed and examined a PET MoCo approach using motion vector fields (MVFs) from a deep-learning reconstructed short MRI scan.

Methods: The evaluation of PET MoCo was performed in a respiratory motion phantom study with varying lesion sizes and tumor to background ratios (TBRs) using a static scan as the ground truth. MRI-based MVFs were derived from either 2000 spokes (MoCo2000, 5-6 min acquisition time) using a Fourier transform reconstruction or 200 spokes (MoCoP2P200, 30-40 s acquisition time) using a deep-learning Phase2Phase (P2P) reconstruction and then incorporated into PET MoCo reconstruction. For six patients with hepatic lesions, the performance of PET MoCo was evaluated using quantitative metrics (SUVmax, SUVpeak, SUVmean, lesion volume) and a blinded radiological review on lesion conspicuity.

Results: MRI-assisted PET MoCo methods provided similar results to static scans across most lesions with varying TBRs in the phantom. Both MoCo2000and MoCoP2P200PET images had significantly higher SUVmax, SUVpeak, SUVmeanand significantly lower lesion volume than non-motion-corrected (non-MoCo) PET images. There was no statistical difference between MoCo2000and MoCoP2P200PET images for SUVmax, SUVpeak, SUVmeanor lesion volume. Both radiological reviewers found that MoCo2000and MoCoP2P200PET significantly improved lesion conspicuity.

Conclusion: An MRI-assisted PET MoCo method was evaluated using the ground truth in a phantom study. In patients with hepatic lesions, PET MoCo images improved quantitative and qualitative metrics based on only 30-40 s of MRI motion modeling data.

TITLE: Imitation learning for improved 3D PET/MR attenuation correction

AUTHORS: Kerstin Kläser, Thomas Varsavsky, Pawel Markiewicz, Tom Vercauteren, Alexander Hammers, David Atkinson, Kris Thielemans, Brian Hutton, M J Cardoso, Sébastien Ourselin

JOURNAL: Medical image analysis

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
The assessment of the quality of synthesised/pseudo Computed Tomography (pCT) images is commonly measured by an intensity-wise similarity between the ground truth CT and the pCT. However, when using the pCT as an attenuation map (μ-map) for PET reconstruction in Positron Emission Tomography Magnetic Resonance Imaging (PET/MRI) minimising the error between pCT and CT neglects the main objective of predicting a pCT that when used as μ-map reconstructs a pseudo PET (pPET) which is as similar as possible to the gold standard CT-derived PET reconstruction. This observation motivated us to propose a novel multi-hypothesis deep learning framework explicitly aimed at PET reconstruction application. A convolutional neural network (CNN) synthesises pCTs by minimising a combination of the pixel-wise error between pCT and CT and a novel metric-loss that itself is defined by a CNN and aims to minimise consequent PET residuals. Training is performed on a database of twenty 3D MR/CT/PET brain image pairs. Quantitative results on a fully independent dataset of twenty-three 3D MR/CT/PET image pairs show that the network is able to synthesise more accurate pCTs. The Mean Absolute Error on the pCT (110.98 HU ± 19.22 HU) compared to a baseline CNN (172.12 HU ± 19.61 HU) and a multi-atlas propagation approach (153.40 HU ± 18.68 HU), and subsequently lead to a significant improvement in the PET reconstruction error (4.74% ± 1.52% compared to baseline 13.72% ± 2.48% and multi-atlas propagation 6.68% ± 2.06%).

TITLE: Image Quality of Cardiac Silicon Photomultiplier PET/CT Using an Infant Phantom of Extremely Low Birth Weight

AUTHORS: Kazuki Fukuchi, Takayuki Shibutani, Yusuke Terakawa, Yoshifumi Nouno, Emi Tateishi, Masahisa Onoguchi, Fukuda Tetsuya

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear medicine technology

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
The lack of pediatrics-specific equipment for nuclear medicine imaging has resulted in insufficient diagnostic information for newborns, especially low-birth-weight infants. Although PET offers high spatial resolution and low radiation exposure, its use in newborns is limited. This study investigated the feasibility of cardiac PET imaging using the latest silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) PET technology in infants of extremely low birth weight (ELBW) using a phantom model.Methods:The study used a phantom model representing a 500-g ELBW infant with brain, cardiac, liver, and lung tissues. The cardiac tissue included a 3-mm-thick defect mimicking myocardial infarction. Organ tracer concentrations were calculated assuming18F-FDG myocardial viability scans and18F-flurpiridaz myocardial perfusion scans and were added to the phantom organs. Imaging was performed using an SiPM PET/CT scanner with a 5-min acquisition. The data acquired in list mode were reconstructed using 3-dimensional ordered-subsets expectation maximization with varying iterations. Image evaluation was based on the depiction of the myocardial defect compared with normal myocardial accumulation.Results:Increasing the number of iterations improved the contrast of the myocardial defect for both tracers, with18F-flurpiridaz showing higher contrast than18F-FDG. However, even at 50 iterations, both tracers overestimated the defect accumulation. A bull's-eye image can display the flow metabolism mismatch using images from both tracers.Conclusion:SiPM PET enabled cardiac PET imaging in a 500-g ELBW phantom with a 1-g heart. However, there were limitations in adequately depicting these defects. Considering the image quality and defect contrast,18F-flurpiridaz appears more desirable than18F-FDG if only one of the two can be used.

TITLE: Kernel graph filtering-A new method for dynamic sinogram denoising

AUTHORS: Shiyao Guo, Yuxia Sheng, Li Chai, Jingxin Zhang

JOURNAL: PloS one

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Low count PET (positron emission tomography) imaging is often desirable in clinical diagnosis and biomedical research, but its images are generally very noisy, due to the very weak signals in the sinograms used in image reconstruction. To address this issue, this paper presents a novel kernel graph filtering method for dynamic PET sinogram denoising. This method is derived from treating the dynamic sinograms as the signals on a graph, and learning the graph adaptively from the kernel principal components of the sinograms to construct a lowpass kernel graph spectrum filter. The kernel graph filter thus obtained is then used to filter the original sinogram time frames to obtain the denoised sinograms for PET image reconstruction. Extensive tests and comparisons on the simulated and real life in-vivo dynamic PET datasets show that the proposed method outperforms the existing methods in sinogram denoising and image enhancement of dynamic PET at all count levels, especially at low count, with a great potential in real life applications of dynamic PET imaging.

TITLE: Data-driven, projection-based respiratory motion compensation of PET data for cardiac PET/CT and PET/MR imaging

AUTHORS: Martin Lyngby Lassen, Thomas Beyer, Alexander Berger, Dietrich Beitzke, Sazan Rasul, Florian Büther, Marcus Hacker, Jacobo Cal-González

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear cardiology : official publication of the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Background: Respiratory patient motion causes blurring of the PET images that may impact accurate quantification of perfusion and infarction extents in PET myocardial viability studies. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of correcting for respiratory motion directly in the PET-listmode data prior to image reconstruction using a data-driven, projection-based, respiratory motion compensation (DPR-MoCo) technique.

Methods: The DPR-MoCo method was validated using simulations of a XCAT phantom (Biograph mMR PET/MR) as well as experimental phantom acquisitions (Biograph mCT PET/CT). Seven patient studies following a dual-tracer (18F-FDG/13N-NH3) imaging-protocol using a PET/MR-system were also evaluated. The performance of the DPR-MoCo method was compared against reconstructions of the acquired data (No-MoCo), a reference gate method (gated) and an image-based MoCo method using the standard reconstruction-transform-average (RTA-MoCo) approach. The target-to-background ratio (TBRLV) in the myocardium and the noise in the liver (CoVliver) were evaluated for all acquisitions. For all patients, the clinical effect of the DPR-MoCo was assessed based on the end-systolic (ESV), the end-diastolic volumes (EDV) and the left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) which were compared to functional values obtained from the cardiac MR.

Results: The DPR-MoCo and the No-MoCo images presented with similar noise-properties (CoV) (P = .12), while the RTA-MoCo and reference-gate images showed increased noise levels (P = .05). TBRLVvalues increased for the motion limited reconstructions when compared to the No-MoCo reconstructions (P > .05). DPR-MoCo results showed higher correlation with the functional values obtained from the cardiac MR than the No-MoCo results, though non-significant (P > .05).

Conclusion: The projection-based DPR-MoCo method helps to improve PET image quality of the myocardium without the need for external devices for motion tracking.

AUTHORS: Jaewon Yang, Asim Afaq, Robert Sibley, Alan McMilan, Ali Pirasteh

JOURNAL: Magma (New York, N.Y.)

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
We aim to provide an overview of technical and clinical unmet needs in deep learning (DL) applications for quantitative and qualitative PET in PET/MR, with a focus on attenuation correction, image enhancement, motion correction, kinetic modeling, and simulated data generation. (1) DL-based attenuation correction (DLAC) remains an area of limited exploration for pediatric whole-body PET/MR and lung-specific DLAC due to data shortages and technical limitations. (2) DL-based image enhancement approximating MR-guided regularized reconstruction with a high-resolution MR prior has shown promise in enhancing PET image quality. However, its clinical value has not been thoroughly evaluated across various radiotracers, and applications outside the head may pose challenges due to motion artifacts. (3) Robust training for DL-based motion correction requires pairs of motion-corrupted and motion-corrected PET/MR data. However, these pairs are rare. (4) DL-based approaches can address the limitations of dynamic PET, such as long scan durations that may cause patient discomfort and motion, providing new research opportunities. (5) Monte-Carlo simulations using anthropomorphic digital phantoms can provide extensive datasets to address the shortage of clinical data. This summary of technical/clinical challenges and potential solutions may provide research opportunities for the research community towards the clinical translation of DL solutions.

TITLE: A depth-of-interaction rebinning method based on both geometric and activity weights

AUTHORS: Yu Liu, Ang Li, Ran Cheng, Bingxuan Li, Qingguo Xie, Xiaoping Wang, Bensheng Qiu, Xun Chen, Peng Xiao

JOURNAL: Computer methods and programs in biomedicine

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Background and objective: For positron emission tomography (PET) scanners with depth-of-interaction (DOI) measurement, the DOI rebinning method that utilizes DOI information to process the projection data is critical to image quality. Current DOI rebinning methods map coincidence events onto the rebinned sinogram based on the correlation of lines of response (LOR). This study aims to incorporate prior radioactivity distribution of the imaging object into DOI rebinning to obtain better image quality.

Methods: A DOI rebinning method based on both geometric and activity weights was proposed to assign coincidence events to the rebinned sinogram defined by a virtual ring. The geometric weights, representing the correlation between LORs, were calculated based on the areas of intersection. The activity weights, reflecting the activity distribution of the imaging object, were derived from the previous reconstructed image.

Results: Monte Carlo simulation data from four phantoms, including the image quality phantom, Derenzo phantom, and two rat-like ROBY phantoms, was used to evaluate the proposed method. The recovery coefficient (RC), contrast recovery coefficient (CRC), structural similarity index measure (SSIM), and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) were used as image quality metrics. Compared to other DOI rebinning methods, the proposed method achieved the highest RC (maximum improvement of 32%) and CRC at the same noise level and was also optimal in terms of the SSIM and PSNR. Meanwhile, incorporating the prior activity distribution into DOI rebinning also improved the image reconstruction speed.

Conclusions: This work developed a new DOI rebinning method combining the correlation of LORs with the prior activity distribution, achieving relatively optimal image quality and reconstruction speed. Furthermore, it still needs to be evaluated on the actual equipment.

TITLE: Changes of [18F]FDG-PET/CT quantitative parameters in tumor lesions by the Bayesian penalized-likelihood PET reconstruction algorithm and its influencing factors

AUTHORS: Yao Liu, Mei-Jia Gao, Jie Zhou, Fan Du, Liang Chen, Zhong-Ke Huang, Ji-Bo Hu, Cen Lou

JOURNAL: BMC medical imaging

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Background: To compare the changes in quantitative parameters and the size and degree of18F-fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]FDG) uptake of malignant tumor lesions between Bayesian penalized-likelihood (BPL) and non-BPL reconstruction algorithms.

Methods: Positron emission tomography/computed tomography images of 86 malignant tumor lesions were reconstructed using the algorithms of ordered subset expectation maximization (OSEM), OSEM + time of flight (TOF), OSEM + TOF + point spread function (PSF), and BPL. [18F]FDG parameters of maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax), SUVmean, metabolic tumor volume (MTV), total lesion glycolysis (TLG), and signal-to-background ratio (SBR) of these lesions were measured. Quantitative parameters between the different reconstruction algorithms were compared, and correlations between parameter variation and lesion size or the degree of [18F]FDG uptake were analyzed.

Results: After BPL reconstruction, SUVmax, SUVmean, and SBR were significantly increased, MTV was significantly decreased. The difference values of %ΔSUVmax, %ΔSUVmean, %ΔSBR, and the absolute value of %ΔMTV between BPL and OSEM + TOF were 40.00%, 38.50%, 33.60%, and 33.20%, respectively, which were significantly higher than those between BPL and OSEM + TOF + PSF. Similar results were observed in the comparison of OSEM and OSEM + TOF + PSF with BPL. The %ΔSUVmax, %ΔSUVmean, and %ΔSBR were all significantly negatively correlated with the size and degree of [18F]FDG uptake in the lesions, whereas significant positive correlations were observed for %ΔMTV and %ΔTLG.

Conclusion: The BPL reconstruction algorithm significantly increased SUVmax, SUVmean, and SBR and decreased MTV of tumor lesions, especially in small or relatively hypometabolic lesions.

TITLE: Accelerated strategy for the MLEM algorithm

AUTHORS: Xuan Zheng, Gangrong Qu, Jiajia Zhou

JOURNAL: Journal of X-ray science and technology

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Background: A statistical method called maximum likelihood expectation maximization (MLEM) is quite attractive, especially in PET/SPECT. However, the convergence rate of the iterative scheme of MLEM is quite slow.

Objective: This study aims to develop and test a new method to speed up the convergence rate of the MLEM algorithm.

Methods: We introduce a relaxation parameter in the conventional MLEM iterative formula and propose the relaxation strategy on the condition that the spectral radius of the derived iterative matrix from the iterative scheme with the accelerated parameter reaches a minimum value.

Results: Experiments with Shepp-Logan phantom and an annual tree image demonstrate that the new computational strategy effectively accelerates computation time while maintains reasonable image quality.

Conclusions: The proposed new computational method involving the relaxation strategy has a faster convergence speed than the original method.

AUTHORS: Alan B McMillan, Tyler J Bradshaw

JOURNAL: PET clinics

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Recent developments in artificial intelligence (AI) technology have enabled new developments that can improve attenuation and scatter correction in PET and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). These technologies will enable the use of accurate and quantitative imaging without the need to acquire a computed tomography image, greatly expanding the capability of PET/MR imaging, PET-only, and SPECT-only scanners. The use of AI to aid in scatter correction will lead to improvements in image reconstruction speed, and improve patient throughput. This article outlines the use of these new tools, surveys contemporary implementation, and discusses their limitations.

TITLE: Progress and current utility of radiomics in PET/CT study of non-metastatic breast cancer: A systematic review

AUTHORS: P M Cárcamo Ibarra, U A López González, A Esteban Hurtado, M A Navas de la Cruz, L Asensio Valero, S Diez Domingo

JOURNAL: Revista espanola de medicina nuclear e imagen molecular..

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Aim: To synthesize the current evidence of the usefulness of radiomics in PET/CT image analysis in local and locally advanced breast cancer. Also, to evaluate the methodological quality of the radiomic studies published.

Methods: Systematic review of articles in different databases until 2021 using the terms "PET", "radiomics", "texture", "breast". Only articles with human data and that included a PET image were included. Studies with simulated data and with less than 20 patients were excluded. Were extracted sample size, radiotracer used, imaging technique, and radiomics characteristics from each article. The methodological quality of the studies was determined using the QUADAS-2 tool.

Results: 18 articles were selected. The retrospective design was the most used. The most studied radiomic characteristic was SUVmax. Several radiomic parameters were correlated with tumor characterization, and tumor heterogeneity proved useful for predicting disease course and response to treatment. Most articles showed a high risk of bias, mainly from the patient selection.

Conclusions: A high probability of bias was observed in most of the published articles. Radiomics is a developing field and more studies are needed to demonstrate its usefulness in routine clinical practice. The QUADAS-2 tool allows critical assessment of the methodological quality of the available evidence. Despite its limitations, radiomics is shown to be an instrument that can help to achieve personalized oncologic management of breast cancer.

ABSTRACT:
Background: Dual-gating reduces respiratory and cardiac motion effects but increases noise. With motion correction, motion is minimized and image quality preserved. We applied motion correction to create end-diastolic respiratory motion corrected images from dual-gated images.

Methods: [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]-FDG) PET images of 13 subjects were reconstructed with 4 methods: non-gated, dual-gated, motion corrected, and motion corrected with 4D-CT (MoCo-4D). Image quality was evaluated using standardized uptake values, contrast ratio, signal-to-noise ratio, coefficient of variation, and contrast-to-noise ratio. Motion minimization was evaluated using myocardial wall thickness.

Results: MoCo-4D showed improvement for contrast ratio (2.83 vs 2.76), signal-to-noise ratio (27.5 vs 20.3) and contrast-to-noise ratio (14.5 vs 11.1) compared to dual-gating. The uptake difference between MoCo-4D and non-gated images was non-significant (P > .05) for the myocardium (2.06 vs 2.15 g/mL), but significant (P < .05) for the blood pool (.80 vs .86 g/mL). Non-gated images had the lowest coefficient of variation (27.3%), with significant increase for all other methods (31.6-32.5%). MoCo-4D showed smallest myocardial wall thickness (16.6 mm) with significant decrease compared to non-gated images (20.9 mm).

Conclusions: End-diastolic respiratory motion correction and 4D-CT resulted in improved motion minimization and image quality over standard dual-gating.

ABSTRACT:
Medical imaging denoising faces great challenges, yet is in great demand. With its distinctive characteristics, medical imaging denoising in the image domain requires innovative deep learning strategies. In this study, we propose a simple yet effective strategy, the content-noise complementary learning (CNCL) strategy, in which two deep learning predictors are used to learn the respective content and noise of the image dataset complementarily. A medical image denoising pipeline based on the CNCL strategy is presented, and is implemented as a generative adversarial network, where various representative networks (including U-Net, DnCNN, and SRDenseNet) are investigated as the predictors. The performance of these implemented models has been validated on medical imaging datasets including CT, MR, and PET. The results show that this strategy outperforms state-of-the-art denoising algorithms in terms of visual quality and quantitative metrics, and the strategy demonstrates a robust generalization capability. These findings validate that this simple yet effective strategy demonstrates promising potential for medical image denoising tasks, which could exert a clinical impact in the future.

TITLE: Artificial Intelligence Augmented Cerebral Nuclear Imaging

AUTHORS: Geoffrey M Currie, K Elizabeth Hawk

JOURNAL: Seminars in nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), has significant potential to advance the capabilities of nuclear neuroimaging. The current and emerging applications of ML and DL in the processing, analysis, enhancement and interpretation of SPECT and PET imaging are explored for brain imaging. Key developments include automated image segmentation, disease classification, and radiomic feature extraction, including lower dimensionality first and second order radiomics, higher dimensionality third order radiomics and more abstract fourth order deep radiomics. DL-based reconstruction, attenuation correction using pseudo-CT generation, and denoising of low-count studies have a role in enhancing image quality. AI has a role in sustainability through applications in radioligand design and preclinical imaging while federated learning addresses data security challenges to improve research and development in nuclear cerebral imaging. There is also potential for generative AI to transform the nuclear cerebral imaging space through solutions to data limitations, image enhancement, patient-centered care, workflow efficiencies and trainee education. Innovations in ML and DL are re-engineering the nuclear neuroimaging ecosystem and reimagining tomorrow's precision medicine landscape.

TITLE: Early differentiation of neurodegenerative diseases using the novel QSM technique: what is the biomarker of each disorder?

AUTHORS: Farzaneh Nikparast, Zohreh Ganji, Hoda Zare

JOURNAL: BMC neuroscience

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
During neurodegenerative diseases, the brain undergoes morphological and pathological changes; Iron deposits are one of the causes of pathological changes in the brain. The Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) technique, a type of magnetic resonance (MR) image reconstruction, is one of the newest diagnostic methods for iron deposits to detect changes in magnetic susceptibility. Numerous research projects have been conducted in this field. The purpose of writing this review article is to identify the first deep brain nuclei that undergo magnetic susceptibility changes during neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease. The purpose of this article is to identify the brain nuclei that are prone to iron deposition in any specific disorder. In addition to the mentioned purpose, this paper proposes the optimal scan parameters and appropriate algorithms of each QSM reconstruction step by reviewing the results of different articles. As a result, The QSM technique can identify nuclei exposed to iron deposition in various neurodegenerative diseases. Also, the selection of scan parameters is different based on the sequence and purpose; an example of the parameters is placed in the tables. The BET toolbox in FSL, Laplacian-based phase-unwrapping process, the V_SHARP algorithm, and morphology-enabled dipole inversion (MEDI) method are the most widely used algorithms in various stages of QSM reconstruction.

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Attenuation correction and scatter compensation (AC/SC) are two main steps toward quantitative PET imaging, which remain challenging in PET-only and PET/MRI systems. These can be effectively tackled via deep learning (DL) methods. However, trustworthy, and generalizable DL models commonly require well-curated, heterogeneous, and large datasets from multiple clinical centers. At the same time, owing to legal/ethical issues and privacy concerns, forming a large collective, centralized dataset poses significant challenges. In this work, we aimed to develop a DL-based model in a multicenter setting without direct sharing of data using federated learning (FL) for AC/SC of PET images.

Methods: Non-attenuation/scatter corrected and CT-based attenuation/scatter corrected (CT-ASC)18F-FDG PET images of 300 patients were enrolled in this study. The dataset consisted of 6 different centers, each with 50 patients, with scanner, image acquisition, and reconstruction protocols varying across the centers. CT-based ASC PET images served as the standard reference. All images were reviewed to include high-quality and artifact-free PET images. Both corrected and uncorrected PET images were converted to standardized uptake values (SUVs). We used a modified nested U-Net utilizing residual U-block in a U-shape architecture. We evaluated two FL models, namely sequential (FL-SQ) and parallel (FL-PL) and compared their performance with the baseline centralized (CZ) learning model wherein the data were pooled to one server, as well as center-based (CB) models where for each center the model was built and evaluated separately. Data from each center were divided to contribute to training (30 patients), validation (10 patients), and test sets (10 patients). Final evaluations and reports were performed on 60 patients (10 patients from each center).

Results: In terms of percent SUV absolute relative error (ARE%), both FL-SQ (CI:12.21-14.81%) and FL-PL (CI:11.82-13.84%) models demonstrated excellent agreement with the centralized framework (CI:10.32-12.00%), while FL-based algorithms improved model performance by over 11% compared to CB training strategy (CI: 22.34-26.10%). Furthermore, the Mann-Whitney test between different strategies revealed no significant differences between CZ and FL-based algorithms (p-value > 0.05) in center-categorized mode. At the same time, a significant difference was observed between the different training approaches on the overall dataset (p-value < 0.05). In addition, voxel-wise comparison, with respect to reference CT-ASC, exhibited similar performance for images predicted by CZ (R2= 0.94), FL-SQ (R2= 0.93), and FL-PL (R2= 0.92), while CB model achieved a far lower coefficient of determination (R2= 0.74). Despite the strong correlations between CZ and FL-based methods compared to reference CT-ASC, a slight underestimation of predicted voxel values was observed.

Conclusion: Deep learning-based models provide promising results toward quantitative PET image reconstruction. Specifically, we developed two FL models and compared their performance with center-based and centralized models. The proposed FL-based models achieved higher performance compared to center-based models, comparable with centralized models. Our work provided strong empirical evidence that the FL framework can fully benefit from the generalizability and robustness of DL models used for AC/SC in PET, while obviating the need for the direct sharing of datasets between clinical imaging centers.

TITLE: Evaluation of Data-Driven Rigid Motion Correction in Clinical Brain PET Imaging

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Head motion during brain PET imaging can significantly degrade the quality of the reconstructed image, leading to reduced diagnostic value and inaccurate quantitation. A fully data-driven motion correction approach was recently demonstrated to produce highly accurate motion estimates (<1 mm) with high temporal resolution (≥1 Hz), which can then be used for a motion-corrected reconstruction. This can be applied retrospectively with no impact on the clinical image acquisition protocol. We present a reader-based evaluation and an atlas-based quantitative analysis of this motion correction approach within a clinical cohort.Methods:Clinical patient data were collected over 2019-2020 and processed retrospectively. Motion was estimated using image-based registration on reconstructions of ultrashort frames (0.6-1.8 s), after which list-mode reconstructions that were fully motion-corrected were performed. Two readers graded the motion-corrected and uncorrected reconstructions. An atlas-based quantitative analysis was performed. Paired Wilcoxon tests were used to test for significant differences in reader scores and SUVs between reconstructions. The Levene test was used to determine whether motion correction had a greater impact on quantitation in the presence of motion than when motion was low.Results:Fifty standard clinical18F-FDG brain PET datasets (age range, 13-83 y; mean ± SD, 59 ± 20 y; 27 women) from 3 scanners were collected. The reader study showed a significantly different, diagnostically relevant improvement by motion correction when motion was present (P= 0.02) and no impact in low-motion cases. Eight percent of all datasets improved from diagnostically unacceptable to acceptable. The atlas-based analysis demonstrated a significant difference between the motion-corrected and uncorrected reconstructions in cases of high motion for 7 of 8 regions of interest (P< 0.05).Conclusion:The proposed approach to data-driven motion estimation and correction demonstrated a clinically significant impact on brain PET image reconstruction.

TITLE: High-resolution positronium lifetime tomography by the method of moments

AUTHORS: Bangyan Huang, Jinyi Qi

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Objective.Positronium lifetime tomography (PLT) is an emerging modality that aims to reconstruct 3D images of positronium lifetime in humans and animalsin vivo. The lifetime of ortho-positronium can be influenced by the microstructure and the concentration of bio-active molecules in tissue, providing valuable information for better understanding disease progression and treatment response. However, efficient high-resolution lifetime image reconstruction methods are currently lacking. Existing methods are either computationally intensive or have poor spatial resolution. This paper presents a fast, high-resolution lifetime image reconstruction method for PLT.Approach. The proposed method, called SIMPLE-Moment (Statistical IMage reconstruction of Positron annihilation LifetimE by Moment weighting), first reconstructs a set of moment images and then estimates the ortho-positronium lifetime image using the method of moments. The implementation of SIMPLE-Moment requires minimal modification to the conventional ordered subset expectation maximization algorithm.Main results.With reasonable assumptions, the proposed method can reconstruct an ortho-positronium lifetime image with a computational cost equivalent to three standard positron emission tomography (PET) image reconstructions. A Monte Carlo simulation study based on an existing time-of-flight PET scanner demonstrates that the ortho-positronium lifetime image reconstructed by SIMPLE-Moment is accurate and comparable to results obtained using the more computationally intensive Statistical Positronium Lifetime Image reconstruction via time-Thresholding (SPLIT) method.Significance. The proposed SIMPLE-Moment method provides an efficient approach to high-resolution reconstruction of ortho-positronium lifetime images. By reducing computational costs while enhancing spatial resolution, this method has the potential to make PLT more accessible and practical for clinical and research applications.

JOURNAL: Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society. IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society. Annual International Conference

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a medical imaging modality relying on numerical methods that integrate the statistical properties of the measurements and prior assumptions about the images. In order to maximize the computed image quality, PET reconstruction algorithms require the setting of hyperparameters that balance data fidelity with regularization. However, their optimal tuning depends on the statistical properties of the raw data and on the clinical objectives. To address this issue, we propose a supervised deep learning strategy based on a residual neural network that takes the raw measured data (sinogram) as input and automatically predicts the optimal value of the regularization parameter of the modified block Sequential Regularized Expectation Maximization (BSREM) algorithm. The proposed strategy is trained on a synthetic dataset consisting of 2D sinograms and their corresponding optimal regularization parameters. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of the approach leading to improved image reconstruction compared to classical manual tuning methods.

TITLE: Total-body low-dose CT image denoising using a prior knowledge transfer technique with a contrastive regularization mechanism

AUTHORS: Minghan Fu, Yanhua Duan, Zhaoping Cheng, Wenjian Qin, Ying Wang, Dong Liang, Zhanli Hu

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Reducing the radiation exposure experienced by patients in total-body computed tomography (CT) imaging has attracted extensive attention in the medical imaging community. A low radiation dose may result in increased noise and artifacts that greatly affect the subsequent clinical diagnosis. To obtain high-quality total-body low-dose CT (LDCT) images, previous deep learning-based research works developed various network architectures. However, most of these methods only employ normal-dose CT (NDCT) images as ground truths to guide the training process of the constructed denoising network. As a result of this simple restriction, the reconstructed images tend to lose favorable image details and easily generate oversmoothed textures. This study explores how to better utilize the information contained in the feature spaces of NDCT images to guide the LDCT image reconstruction process and achieve high-quality results.

Methods: We propose a novel intratask knowledge transfer (KT) method that leverages the knowledge distilled from NDCT images as an auxiliary component of the LDCT image reconstruction process. Our proposed architecture is named the teacher-student consistency network (TSC-Net), which consists of teacher and student networks with identical architectures. By employing the designed KT loss, the student network is encouraged to emulate the teacher network in the representation space and gain robust prior content. In addition, to further exploit the information contained in CT scans, a contrastive regularization mechanism (CRM) built upon contrastive learning is introduced. The CRM aims to minimize and maximize the L2 distances from the predicted CT images to the NDCT samples and to the LDCT samples in the latent space, respectively. Moreover, based on attention and the deformable convolution approach, we design a dynamic enhancement module (DEM) to improve the network capability to transform input information flows.

Results: By conducting ablation studies, we prove the effectiveness of the proposed KT loss, CRM, and DEM. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the TSC-Net outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Additionally, the excellent results obtained for clinical readings also prove that our proposed method can reconstruct high-quality CT images for clinical applications.

Conclusions: Based on the experimental results and clinical readings, the TSC-Net has better performance than other approaches. In our future work, we may explore the reconstruction of LDCT images by fusing the positron emission tomography (PET) and CT modalities to further improve the visual quality of the reconstructed CT images.

JOURNAL: IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Positron Emission Tomography (PET) has become a preferred imaging modality for cancer diagnosis, radiotherapy planning, and treatment responses monitoring. Accurate and automatic tumor segmentation is the fundamental requirement for these clinical applications. Deep convolutional neural networks have become the state-of-the-art in PET tumor segmentation. The normalization process is one of the key components for accelerating network training and improving the performance of the network. However, existing normalization methods either introduce batch noise into the instance PET image by calculating statistics on batch level or introduce background noise into every single pixel by sharing the same learnable parameters spatially. In this paper, we proposed an attentive transformation (AT)-based normalization method for PET tumor segmentation. We exploit the distinguishability of breast tumor in PET images and dynamically generate dedicated and pixel-dependent learnable parameters in normalization via the transformation on a combination of channel-wise and spatial-wise attentive responses. The attentive learnable parameters allow to re-calibrate features pixel-by-pixel to focus on the high-uptake area while attenuating the background noise of PET images. Our experimental results on two real clinical datasets show that the AT-based normalization method improves breast tumor segmentation performance when compared with the existing normalization methods.

TITLE: Fast and memory-efficient reconstruction of sparse Poisson data in listmode with non-smooth priors with application to time-of-flight PET

AUTHORS: Georg Schramm, Martin Holler

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Objective.Complete time of flight (TOF) sinograms of state-of-the-art TOF PET scanners have a large memory footprint. Currently, they contain ∼4 · 109data bins which amount to ∼17 GB in 32 bit floating point precision. Moreover, their size will continue to increase with advances in the achievable detector TOF resolution and increases in the axial field of view. Using iterative algorithms to reconstruct such enormous TOF sinograms becomes increasingly challenging due to the memory requirements and the computation time needed to evaluate the forward model for every data bin. This is especially true for more advanced optimization algorithms such as the stochastic primal-dual hybrid gradient (SPDHG) algorithm which allows for the use of non-smooth priors for regularization using subsets with guaranteed convergence. SPDHG requires the storage of additional sinograms in memory, which severely limits its application to data sets from state-of-the-art TOF PET systems using conventional computing hardware.Approach.Motivated by the generally sparse nature of the TOF sinograms, we propose and analyze a new listmode (LM) extension of the SPDHG algorithm for image reconstruction of sparse data following a Poisson distribution. The new algorithm is evaluated based on realistic 2D and 3D simulationsn, and a real data set acquired on a state-of-the-art TOF PET/CT system. The performance of the newly proposed LM SPDHG algorithm is compared against the conventional sinogram SPDHG and the listmode EM-TV algorithm.Main results.We show that the speed of convergence of the proposed LM-SPDHG is equivalent the original SPDHG operating on binned data (TOF sinograms). However, we find that for a TOF PET system with 400 ps TOF resolution and 25 cm axial FOV, the proposed LM-SPDHG reduces the required memory from approximately 56 to 0.7 GB for a short dynamic frame with 107prompt coincidences and to 12.4 GB for a long static acquisition with 5·108prompt coincidences.Significance.In contrast to SPDHG, the reduced memory requirements of LM-SPDHG enables a pure GPU implementation on state-of-the-art GPUs-avoiding memory transfers between host and GPU-which will substantially accelerate reconstruction times. This in turn will allow the application of LM-SPDHG in routine clinical practice where short reconstruction times are crucial.

TITLE: Enhancing radiomics robustness using bayesian penalized likelihood PET reconstruction: application to Phantom and non-small cell lung cancer patient studies

AUTHORS: Zahra Valibeiglou, Jalil Pirayesh Islamian, Yunus Soleymani, Saeed Farzanehfar, Farahnaz Aghahosseini, Neda Gilani, Arman Rahmim, Peyman Sheikhzadeh

JOURNAL: BMC medical imaging

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: This study aims to enhance the diagnostic and prognostic capabilities of PET imaging through improved robustness of radiomics features, utilizing the Bayesian penalized likelihood (BPL) reconstruction algorithm. Specifically, we focus on18F-FDG PET imaging of lung cancer, which, with non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) as its most prevalent form, continues to be a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. The early detection and precise staging of NSCLC are crucial for effectively managing and treating the disease.

Method: We studied a NEMA image quality (IQ) phantom and 15 patient PET lesions (14 NSCLC patients selected from 30 patients originally considered). The study assessed the stability of radiomics features against various imaging parameters, emphasizing the impact of the BPL reconstruction algorithm with varying β-values (50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 600, and 700) and three phantom lesion to background ratios (LBRs) of 2:1, 4:1, and 8:1. Manual segmentation was performed, and subsequently, 130 radiomic features were extracted from the reconstructed images. The stability of radiomics features was assessed by calculating the coefficient of variation (COV) for each feature across variations in reconstruction parameters. A COV of ≤ 5% indicated high stability.

Results: Our results indicate that morphological and intensity-based features exhibit excellent stability, with a COV of less than 5%. Texture-based features, despite their complexity, also demonstrated robustness. Specifically, 32.3%, 39.2%, 42.3%, and 37.6% of features exhibited high stability in phantom LBR 2:1, phantom LBR 4:1, phantom LBR 8:1, and patient studies, respectively. Overall, 13 morphological, 8 intensity, 6 intensity-histogram, and 5 texture-based features were found to be highly stable against different LBRs and reconstruction parameters.

Conclusions: The BPL reconstruction algorithm may enhance the robustness of PET radiomics features, supporting their use in clinical settings for non-invasive diagnosis and staging. The adoption of BPL towards improved PET radiomics robustness has the potential to transform NSCLC evaluation and management, but still needs standardization.

TITLE: DRONE: Dual-Domain Residual-based Optimization NEtwork for Sparse-View CT Reconstruction

AUTHORS: Weiwen Wu, Dianlin Hu, Chuang Niu, Hengyong Yu, Varut Vardhanabhuti, Ge Wang

JOURNAL: IEEE transactions on medical imaging

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Deep learning has attracted rapidly increasing attention in the field of tomographic image reconstruction, especially for CT, MRI, PET/SPECT, ultrasound and optical imaging. Among various topics, sparse-view CT remains a challenge which targets a decent image reconstruction from very few projections. To address this challenge, in this article we propose a Dual-domain Residual-based Optimization NEtwork (DRONE). DRONE consists of three modules respectively for embedding, refinement, and awareness. In the embedding module, a sparse sinogram is first extended. Then, sparse-view artifacts are effectively suppressed in the image domain. After that, the refinement module recovers image details in the residual data and image domains synergistically. Finally, the results from the embedding and refinement modules in the data and image domains are regularized for optimized image quality in the awareness module, which ensures the consistency between measurements and images with the kernel awareness of compressed sensing. The DRONE network is trained, validated, and tested on preclinical and clinical datasets, demonstrating its merits in edge preservation, feature recovery, and reconstruction accuracy.

TITLE: The effects of back-projection variants in BPF-like TOF PET reconstruction using CNN filtration - Based on simulated and clinical brain data

AUTHORS: Li Lv, Gengsheng L Zeng, Gaoyu Chen, Wenxiang Ding, Fenghua Weng, Qiu Huang

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Background: The back-projection strategies such as confidence weighting (CW) and most likely annihilation position (MLAP) have been adopted into back-projection-and-filtering-like (BPF-like) deep reconstruction model and shown great potential on fast and accurate PET reconstruction. Although the two methods degenerate to an identical model at the time resolution of 0 ps, they represent two distinct approaches at the realistic time resolutions of current commercial systems. There is a lack of a systematic and fair assessment on these differences.

Purpose: This work aims to analyze the impact of back-projection variants on CNN-based PET image reconstruction to find the most effective back-projection model, and ultimately contribute to accurate PET reconstruction.

Methods: Different back-projection strategies (CW and MLAP) and different angular view processing methods (view-summed and view-grouped) were considered, leading to the comparison of four back-projection variants integrated with the same CNN filtration model. Meanwhile, we investigated two strategies of physical effect compensation, either introducing pre-corrected data as the input or adding a channel of attenuation map to the CNN model. After training models separately on Monte-Carlo-simulated BrainWeb phantoms with full dose (events = 3×107), we tested them on both simulated phantoms and clinical brain scans with two dosage levels. For the performance assessment, peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and root mean square error (RMSE) were used to evaluate the pixel-wise error, structural similarity index (SSIM) to evaluate the structural similarity, and contrast recovery coefficient (CRC) in manually selected ROI to compare the region recovery.

Results: Compared to two MLAP-based histo-image reconstruction models, two CW-based back-projected image methods produced clearer, sharper, and more detailed images, from both simulated and clinical data. For angular view processing methods, view-grouped histo-image improved image quality, while view-grouped cwbp-image showed no advantage except for contrast recovery. Quantitative analysis on simulated data demonstrated that the view-summed cwbp-image model achieved the best PSNR, RMSE, SSIM, while the 8-view cwbp-image model achieved the best CRC in lesions and the white matter. Additionally, the multi-channel input model including the back-projection image and attenuation map was proved to be the most efficient and simplest method for compensating for physical effects for brain data. Applying Gaussian blur to the histo-image yielded images with limited improvement. All above results hold for both the half-dose and the full-dose cases.

Conclusion: For brain imaging, the evaluation based on metrics PSNR, RMSE, SSIM, and CRC indicates that the view-summed CW-based back-projection variant is the most effective input for the BPF-like reconstruction model using CNN filtration, which can involve the attenuation map through an additional channel to effectively compensate for physical effects.

TITLE: Super-resolution in brain positron emission tomography using a real-time motion capture system

AUTHORS: Yanis Chemli, Marc-André Tétrault, Thibault Marin, Marc D Normandin, Isabelle Bloch, Georges El Fakhri, Jinsong Ouyang, Yoann Petibon

JOURNAL: NeuroImage

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Super-resolution (SR) is a methodology that seeks to improve image resolution by exploiting the increased spatial sampling information obtained from multiple acquisitions of the same target with accurately known sub-resolution shifts. This work aims to develop and evaluate an SR estimation framework for brain positron emission tomography (PET), taking advantage of a high-resolution infra-red tracking camera to measure shifts precisely and continuously. Moving phantoms and non-human primate (NHP) experiments were performed on a GE Discovery MI PET/CT scanner (GE Healthcare) using an NDI Polaris Vega (Northern Digital Inc), an external optical motion tracking device. To enable SR, a robust temporal and spatial calibration of the two devices was developed as well as a list-mode Ordered Subset Expectation Maximization PET reconstruction algorithm, incorporating the high-resolution tracking data from the Polaris Vega to correct motion for measured line of responses on an event-by-event basis. For both phantoms and NHP studies, the SR reconstruction method yielded PET images with visibly increased spatial resolution compared to standard static acquisitions, allowing improved visualization of small structures. Quantitative analysis in terms of SSIM, CNR and line profiles were conducted and validated our observations. The results demonstrate that SR can be achieved in brain PET by measuring target motion in real-time using a high-resolution infrared tracking camera.

TITLE: Diffused Multi-scale Generative Adversarial Network for low-dose PET images reconstruction

AUTHORS: Xiang Yu, Daoyan Hu, Qiong Yao, Yu Fu, Yan Zhong, Jing Wang, Mei Tian, Hong Zhang

JOURNAL: Biomedical engineering online

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: The aim of this study is to convert low-dose PET (L-PET) images to full-dose PET (F-PET) images based on our Diffused Multi-scale Generative Adversarial Network (DMGAN) to offer a potential balance between reducing radiation exposure and maintaining diagnostic performance.

Methods: The proposed method includes two modules: the diffusion generator and the u-net discriminator. The goal of the first module is to get different information from different levels, enhancing the generalization ability of the generator to the image and improving the stability of the training. Generated images are inputted into the u-net discriminator, extracting details from both overall and specific perspectives to enhance the quality of the generated F-PET images. We conducted evaluations encompassing both qualitative assessments and quantitative measures. In terms of quantitative comparisons, we employed two metrics, structure similarity index measure (SSIM) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) to evaluate the performance of diverse methods.

Results: Our proposed method achieved the highest PSNR and SSIM scores among the compared methods, which improved PSNR by at least 6.2% compared to the other methods. Compared to other methods, the synthesized full-dose PET image generated by our method exhibits a more accurate voxel-wise metabolic intensity distribution, resulting in a clearer depiction of the epilepsy focus.

Conclusions: The proposed method demonstrates improved restoration of original details from low-dose PET images compared to other models trained on the same datasets. This method offers a potential balance between minimizing radiation exposure and preserving diagnostic performance.

ABSTRACT:
The impact of PET image acquisition and reconstruction parameters on SUV measurements or radiomic feature values is widely documented. This scanner effect is detrimental to the design and validation of predictive or prognostic models and limits the use of large multicenter cohorts. To reduce the impact of this scanner effect, the ComBat method has been proposed and is now used in various contexts. The purpose of this article is to explain and illustrate the use of ComBat based on practical examples. We also give examples in which the ComBat assumptions are not met and, thus, in which ComBat should not be used.

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: In order to achieve comparability of image quality, harmonisation of PET system performance is imperative. In this study, prototype harmonisation criteria for PET brain studies were developed.

Methods: Twelve clinical PET/CT systems (4 GE, 4 Philips, 4 Siemens, including SiPM-based "digital" systems) were used to acquire 30-min PET scans of a Hoffman 3D Brain phantom filled with ~ 33 kBq·mL-1[18F]FDG. Scan data were reconstructed using various reconstruction settings. The images were rigidly coregistered to a template (voxel size 1.17 × 1.17 × 2.00 mm3) onto which several volumes of interest (VOIs) were defined. Recovery coefficients (RC) and grey matter to white matter ratios (GMWMr) were derived for eroded (denoted in the text by subscript e) and non-eroded grey (GM) and white (WM) matter VOIs as well as a mid-phantom cold spot (VOIcold) and VOIs from the Hammers atlas. In addition, left-right hemisphere differences and voxel-by-voxel differences compared to a reference image were assessed.

Results: Systematic differences were observed for reconstructions with and without point-spread-function modelling (PSFONand PSFOFF, respectively). Normalising to image-derived activity, upper and lower limits ensuring image comparability were as follows: for PSFON, RCGMe= [0.97-1.01] and GMWMre= [3.51-3.91] for eroded VOI and RCGM= [0.78-0.83] and GMWMr = [1.77-2.06] for non-eroded VOI, and for PSFOFF, RCGMe= [0.92-0.99] and GMWMre= [3.14-3.68] for eroded VOI and RCGM= [0.75-0.81] and GMWMr = [1.72-1.95] for non-eroded VOI.

Conclusions: To achieve inter-scanner comparability, we propose selecting reconstruction settings based on RCGMeand GMWMreas specified in "Results". These proposed standards should be tested prospectively to validate and/or refine the harmonisation criteria.

JOURNAL: Academic radiology

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Rationale and objectives: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are deep learning models aimed at generating fake realistic looking images. These novel models made a great impact on the computer vision field. Our study aims to review the literature on GANs applications in radiology.

Materials and methods: This systematic review followed the PRISMA guidelines. Electronic datasets were searched for studies describing applications of GANs in radiology. We included studies published up-to September 2019.

Results: Data were extracted from 33 studies published between 2017 and 2019. Eighteen studies focused on CT images generation, ten on MRI, three on PET/MRI and PET/CT, one on ultrasound and one on X-ray. Applications in radiology included image reconstruction and denoising for dose and scan time reduction (fourteen studies), data augmentation (six studies), transfer between modalities (eight studies) and image segmentation (five studies). All studies reported that generated images improved the performance of the developed algorithms.

Conclusion: GANs are increasingly studied for various radiology applications. They enable the creation of new data, which can be used to improve clinical care, education and research.

TITLE: Marker-less and calibration-less motion correction method for brain PET

AUTHORS: Yuma Iwao, Go Akamatsu, Hideaki Tashima, Miwako Takahashi, Taiga Yamaya

JOURNAL: Radiological physics and technology

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Marker-less head motion correction methods have been well-studied; however, no reports discussing potential issues in positional calibration between a PET system and an external sensor remain limited. In this study, we develop a method for positional calibration between the PET system and an external range sensor to achieve practical head motion correction. The basic concept of the developed method involves using the subject's face model as a marker not only for head motion detection but also for the system positional calibration. The face model of the subject, which can be obtained easily using the range sensor, can also be calculated from a computed tomography (CT) image of the same subject. The CT image, which is acquired separately for attenuation correction in PET, has the same coordinates as the PET image because of the appropriate matching algorithm between CT and PET images. The proposed method was implemented in the helmet-type PET and the motion correction accuracy was assessed quantitatively using a mannequin head. The phantom experiments demonstrated the performance of the developed motion correction method; high-resolution images with no trace of the applied motion were obtained as if no motion was provided. Statistical analysis supported the visual assessment results in terms of the spatial resolution, contrast recovery; uniformity, and the results implied that motion with correction slightly improved image quality compared with the motionless case. The tolerance of the developed method against potential tracking errors had a minimum 10% difference in the amplitude of the rotation angle.

ABSTRACT:
In recent decades, researchers worldwide have directed their efforts toward enhancing the quality of PET imaging. The detection sensitivity and image resolution of conventional PET scanners with a short axial field of view have been constrained, leading to a suboptimal signal-to-noise ratio. The advent of long-axial-field-of-view PET scanners, exemplified by the uEXPLORER system, marked a significant advancement. Total-body PET imaging possesses an extensive scan range of 194 cm and an ultrahigh detection sensitivity, and it has emerged as a promising avenue for improving image quality while reducing the administered radioactivity dose and shortening acquisition times. In this review, we elucidate the application of the uEXPLORER system at the Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, including the disease distribution, patient selection workflow, scanning protocol, and several enhanced clinical applications, along with encountered challenges. We anticipate that this review will provide insights into routine clinical practice and ultimately improve patient care.

JOURNAL: Applied radiation and isotopes : including data, instrumentation and methods for use in agriculture, industry and medicine

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Using National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) phantom, the behavior of four distinct Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (PET/CT) reconstruction algorithms was investigated. These reconstruction algorithms were (Ordered Subset Expectation Maximization (OSEM), OSEM+ (Point Spread Function) PSF, OSEM + Time of Flight (TOF), and OSEM + TOF + PSF), and the focus was on sphere sizes and SBRs using recovery coefficients as a quantitation method. The obtained results demonstrated the significant effect of TOF on Gibbs artifact and Partial Volume Effect (PVE) at various Sphere-to-Background Ratios (SBRs). TOF-based algorithms improved quantification accuracy and mitigated the influence of Gibbs artifact, particularly at higher SBRs. Compared to PSF algorithm, TOF- based algorithms effectively mitigated the impact of PVE on small-sized spheres and less dependent on SBRs. In terms of Standardized Uptake Value (SUV) quantification, SUVmean was better when utilizing TOF-based algorithms at lower SBRs, whereas SUVmax at higher SBRs. The combination of TOF and PSF produced a promising outcomes in quantifying and detecting a small-sized spheres across various SBRs, ultimately resulting in a more reliable and precise diagnostic information.

ABSTRACT:
Fast and low-dose reconstructions of medical images are highly desired in clinical routines. We propose a hybrid deep-learning and iterative reconstruction (hybrid DL-IR) framework and apply it for fast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), fast positron emission tomography (PET), and low-dose computed tomography (CT) image generation tasks. First, in a retrospective MRI study (6,066 cases), we demonstrate its capability of handling 3- to 10-fold under-sampled MR data, enabling organ-level coverage with only 10- to 100-s scan time; second, a low-dose CT study (142 cases) shows that our framework can successfully alleviate the noise and streak artifacts in scans performed with only 10% radiation dose (0.61 mGy); and last, a fast whole-body PET study (131 cases) allows us to faithfully reconstruct tumor-induced lesions, including small ones (<4 mm), from 2- to 4-fold-accelerated PET acquisition (30-60 s/bp). This study offers a promising avenue for accurate and high-quality image reconstruction with broad clinical value.

AUTHORS: Prodromos Gavriilidis, Felix M Mottaghy, Michel Koole, Tineke van de Weijer, Cristina Mitea, Jochem A J van der Pol, Thiemo J A van Nijnatten, Floris P Jansen, Roel Wierts

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: The positron range effect can impair PET image quality of Gallium-68 (68Ga). A positron range correction (PRC) can be applied to reduce this effect. In this study, the effect of a tissue-independent PRC for68Ga was investigated on patient data.

Methods: PET/CT data (40 patients: [68Ga]Ga-DOTATOC or [68Ga]Ga-PSMA) were reconstructed using Q.Clear reconstruction algorithm. Two reconstructions were performed per patient, Q.Clear with and without PRC. SUVmaxand contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) values per lesion were compared between PRC and non-PRC images. Five experienced nuclear medicine physicians reviewed the images and chose the preferred reconstruction based on the image quality, lesion detectability, and diagnostic confidence.

Results: A total of 155 lesions were identified. The PRC resulted in statistically significant increase of the SUVmaxand CNR for soft tissue lesions (6.4%, p < 0.001; 8.6%, p < 0.001), bone lesions (14.6%, p < 0.001; 12.5%, p < 0.001), and lung lesions (3.6%, p = 0.010; 6.3%, p = 0.001). This effect was most prominent in small lesions (SUVmax: 12.0%, p < 0.001, and CNR: 13.0%, p < 0.001). Similar or better image quality, lesion detectability, and diagnostic confidence was achieved in PRC images compared to the non-PRC images as those assessed by the expert readers.

Conclusions: A tissue-independent PRC increased the SUVmaxand CNR in soft tissue, bone, and lung lesions with a larger effect for the small lesions. Visual assessment demonstrated similar or better image quality, lesion detectability, and diagnostic confidence in PRC images compared to the non-PRC images.

TITLE: Temporal information-guided dynamic dual-tracer PET signal separation network

AUTHORS: Junyi Tong, Chunxia Wang, Huafeng Liu

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: The difficulty of dynamic dual-tracer positron emission tomography (PET) technology is to separate the complete single-tracer information from mixed dual-tracer. Traditional methods cannot separate single-injection single-scan dynamic dual-tracer PET images. In this paper, we propose a deep learning framework based on gated recurrent unit (GRU) network and evaluate its performance with simulation experiments and realistic monkey data.

Methods: The proposed single-scan dynamic dual-tracer PET image separation network consists of three parts, including encoder, separation, and decoder module. Encoder part is to map the mixed time activity curves (TACs) from the low-dimensional space to the high-dimensional space to get mixed weight vector matrix. Separation part is to capture the temporal information of mixed weight vector matrix using bi-directional GRU (bi-GRU) layer to obtain the single-tracer masks, and the decoding part remaps the high-dimensional single-tracer weight vector matrix to the low-dimensional space to obtain two separated single tracers.

Results: In the simulation experiments under different tracers, phantoms, noise levels, arterial input function (AIF), and k-parameter with Gaussian random, compared to the stacked auto encoder network and traditional background subtraction method, GRU-based network has better performance with low bias and mean squared error. In the realistic study, the image results of GRU network have higher mean structural similarity and peak signal to noise ratio.

Conclusions: This study demonstrates the feasibility of temporal information-guided neural network in single-injection single-scan dynamic dual-tracer PET images separation. The GRU-based network uses TAC temporal information without AIFs to make the separation results more robust and accurate, which significantly outperforms state-of-the-art method qualitatively and quantitatively.

AUTHORS: Pengcheng Hu, Yiqiu Zhang, Haojun Yu, Shuguang Chen, Hui Tan, Chi Qi, Yun Dong, Ying Wang, Zilin Deng, Hongcheng Shi

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: The aim of the study was to determine a faster PET acquisition protocol for a total-body PET/CT scanner by assessing the image quality that is equivalent to a conventional digital PET/CT scanner from both a phantom and a clinical perspective.

Methods: A phantom study using a NEMA/IEC NU-2 body phantom was first performed in both a total-body PET/CT (uEXPLORER) and a routine digital PET/CT (uMI 780), with a hot sphere to background activity concentration ratio of 4:1. The contrast recovery coefficient (CRC), background variability (BV), and recovery coefficient (RC: RCmaxand RCmean) were assessed in the uEXPLORER with different scanning durations and reconstruction protocols, which were compared to those acquired from the uMI 780 with clinical acquisition settings. The coefficient of variation (COV) of the uMI 780 with clinical settings was calculated and used as a threshold reference to determine the optimized scanning duration and reconstruction protocol for the uEXPLORER. The obtained protocol from the phantom study was subsequently tested and validated in 30 oncology patients. Images acquired from the uMI 780 with 2-3 min per bed position were referred as G780 and served as the reference for comparison. All PET raw data from the uEXPLORER were reconstructed using the data-cutting technique to simulate a 30-s, 45-s, or 60-s acquisition duration, respectively. The iterations were 2 and 3 for the uEXPLORER, referred as G30s_3i, G45s_2i, G45s_3i, G60s_2i, and G60s_3i, respectively. A 5-point Likert scale was used in the qualitative analysis to assess the image quality. The image quality was also evaluated by the liver COV, the lesion target-to-background ratio (TBR), and the lesion signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).

Results: In the phantom study, CRC, BV, RCmax, and RCmeanin the uEXPLORER with different scanning durations and reconstruction iterations were compared with those in the uMI 780 with clinical settings. A minor fluctuation was found among different scanning durations. COV of the uMI 780 with clinical settings was 11.6%, and a protocol with a 30-45-s scanning duration and 2 or 3 iterations for the uEXPLORER was found to provide an equivalent image quality as the uMI 780. An almost perfect agreement was shown with a kappa value of 0.875. The qualitative score of the G30s_3i in the uEXPLORER was inferior to the G780 reference (p = 0.001); however, the scores of other groups in the uEXPLORER with a 45-s and above acquisition time were higher than the G780 in the uMI 780. In quantitative analysis, the delay time between the two scans in the two orders was not significantly different. There was no significant difference of the liver COV between the G780 and G30s_3i (p = 0.162). A total of 33 lesions were analyzed in the clinical patient study. There was no significant difference in lesion TBR between the reference G780 and the G45s_2i obtained from the uEXPLORER (p = 0.072), while the latter showed a higher lesion SNR value compared to that in uMI 780 with clinical settings (p < 0.001).

Conclusions: This study showed that a fast PET protocol with a 30-45-s acquisition time in the total-body uEXPLORER PET/CT can provide an equivalent image quality as the conventional digital uMI 780 PET/CT with longer clinical acquisition settings.

TITLE: 3D-MedTranCSGAN: 3D Medical Image Transformation using CSGAN

AUTHORS: S Poonkodi, M Kanchana

JOURNAL: Computers in biology and medicine

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Computer vision techniques are a rapidly growing area of transforming medical images for various specific medical applications. In an end-to-end application, this paper proposes a 3D Medical Image Transformation Using a CSGAN model named a 3D-MedTranCSGAN. The 3D-MedTranCSGAN model is an integration of non-adversarial loss components and the Cyclic Synthesized Generative Adversarial Networks. The proposed model utilizes PatchGAN's discriminator network, to penalize the difference between the synthesized image and the original image. The model also computes the non-adversary loss functions such as content, perception, and style transfer losses. 3DCascadeNet is a new generator architecture introduced in the paper, which is used to enhance the perceptiveness of the transformed medical image by encoding-decoding pairs. We use the 3D-MedTranCSGAN model to do various tasks without modifying specific applications: PET to CT image transformation; reconstruction of CT to PET; modification of movement artefacts in MR images; and removing noise in PET images. We found that 3D-MedTranCSGAN outperformed other transformation methods in our experiments. For the first task, the proposed model yields SSIM is 0.914, PSNR is 26.12, MSE is 255.5, VIF is 0.4862, UQI is 0.9067 and LPIPs is 0.2284. For the second task, the model yields 0.9197, 25.7, 257.56, 0.4962, 0.9027, 0.2262. For the third task, the model yields 0.8862, 24.94, 0.4071, 0.6410, 0.2196. For the final task, the model yields 0.9521, 33.67, 33.57, 0.6091, 0.9255, 0.0244. Based on the result analysis, the proposed model outperforms the other techniques.

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Objective. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of tau deposition using [18F]-MK6240 often involves long acquisitions in older subjects, many of whom exhibit dementia symptoms. The resulting unavoidable head motion can greatly degrade image quality. Motion increases the variability of PET quantitation for longitudinal studies across subjects, resulting in larger sample sizes in clinical trials of Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatment.Approach. After using an ultra-short frame-by-frame motion detection method based on the list-mode data, we applied an event-by-event list-mode reconstruction to generate the motion-corrected images from 139 scans acquired in 65 subjects. This approach was initially validated in two phantoms experiments against optical tracking data. We developed a motion metric based on the average voxel displacement in the brain to quantify the level of motion in each scan and consequently evaluate the effect of motion correction on images from studies with substantial motion. We estimated the rate of tau accumulation in longitudinal studies (51 subjects) by calculating the difference in the ratio of standard uptake values in key brain regions for AD. We compared the regions' standard deviations across subjects from motion and non-motion-corrected images.Main results. Individually, 14% of the scans exhibited notable motion quantified by the proposed motion metric, affecting 48% of the longitudinal datasets with three time points and 25% of all subjects. Motion correction decreased the blurring in images from scans with notable motion and improved the accuracy in quantitative measures. Motion correction reduced the standard deviation of the rate of tau accumulation by -49%, -24%, -18%, and -16% in the entorhinal, inferior temporal, precuneus, and amygdala regions, respectively.Significance. The list-mode-based motion correction method is capable of correcting both fast and slow motion during brain PET scans. It leads to improved brain PET quantitation, which is crucial for imaging AD.

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine

ABSTRACT:
The image quality and quantitative accuracy of82Rb myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) using PET is challenged by the extensive positron range (PR) effects, with the PR of82Rb being about 7 mm in soft tissues. This study explored the feasibility of applying postacquisition PR correction (PRC) to routine82Rb PET/CT MPI acquisitions and assessed its impact on diagnostic accuracy and image quality.Methods:We implemented a PRC method adjusted to82Rb into a vendor-provided reconstruction toolbox, using tissue-specific corrections for soft tissue, bone, and air/lungs. The PRC was evaluated in 2 cohorts: the first comprised 25 healthy volunteers who underwent repeated82Rb MPI within 2 wk, and the second included 66 patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease. We measured the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) for the volunteer cohort. In the patient cohort, the impact of PRC was evaluated as changes in the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), using fractional flow reserve as the gold standard (values < 80% were considered significantly reduced). We calculated AUCs for stress and ischemic total perfusion deficits.Results:In the volunteer cohort, PRC-based reconstructions (standard reconstruction [STD] + PRC) demonstrated significantly improved SNR and CNR compared with STD, with median increases of 22% and 47% for SNR and CNR, respectively (P< 0.05). For the patient cohort, comparable AUCs were reported for STD- versus PRC-based reconstructions (stress total perfusion deficits, 0.84 vs. 0.83 [P= 0.49]; ischemic total perfusion deficits, 0.87 vs. 0.87 [P= 0.80]).Conclusion:PRC significantly enhances SNR and CNR compared with STD without affecting the diagnostic accuracy of the scans. Given the significantly improved image quality, PRC may be recommended for MPI using82Rb PET/CT clinical-routine-assessment interpretation of TPD.

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Total-body PET/CT images can be rendered to produce images of a subject's face and body. In response to privacy and identifiability concerns when sharing data, we have developed and validated a workflow that obscures (defaces) a subject's face in 3-dimensional volumetric data.Methods:To validate our method, we measured facial identifiability before and after defacing images from 30 healthy subjects who were imaged with both [18F]FDG PET and CT at either 3 or 6 time points. Briefly, facial embeddings were calculated using Google's FaceNet, and an analysis of clustering was used to estimate identifiability.Results:Faces rendered from CT images were correctly matched to CT scans at other time points at a rate of 93%, which decreased to 6% after defacing. Faces rendered from PET images were correctly matched to PET images at other time points at a maximum rate of 64% and to CT images at a maximum rate of 50%, both of which decreased to 7% after defacing. We further demonstrated that defaced CT images can be used for attenuation correction during PET reconstruction, introducing a maximum bias of -3.3% in regions of the cerebral cortex nearest the face.Conclusion:We believe that the proposed method provides a baseline of anonymity and discretion when sharing image data online or between institutions and will help to facilitate collaboration and future regulatory compliance.

TITLE: Data-driven respiratory phase-matched PET attenuation correction without CT

AUTHORS: Donghwi Hwang, Seung Kwan Kang, Kyeong Yun Kim, Hongyoon Choi, Seongho Seo, Jae Sung Lee

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
We propose a deep learning-based data-driven respiratory phase-matched gated-PET attenuation correction (AC) method that does not need a gated-CT. The proposed method is a multi-step process that consists of data-driven respiratory gating, gated attenuation map estimation using maximum-likelihood reconstruction of attenuation and activity (MLAA) algorithm, and enhancement of the gated attenuation maps using convolutional neural network (CNN). The gated MLAA attenuation maps enhanced by the CNN allowed for the phase-matched AC of gated-PET images. We conducted a non-rigid registration of the gated-PET images to generate motion-free PET images. We trained the CNN by conducting a 3D patch-based learning with 80 oncologic whole-body18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) PET/CT scan data and applied it to seven regional PET/CT scans that cover the lower lung and upper liver. We investigated the impact of the proposed respiratory phase-matched AC of PET without utilizing CT on tumor size and standard uptake value (SUV) assessment, and PET image quality (%STD). The attenuation corrected gated and motion-free PET images generated using the proposed method yielded sharper organ boundaries and better noise characteristics than conventional gated and ungated PET images. A banana artifact observed in a phase-mismatched CT-based AC was not observed in the proposed approach. By employing the proposed method, the size of tumor was reduced by 12.3% and SUV90%was increased by 13.3% in tumors with larger movements than 5 mm. %STD of liver uptake was reduced by 11.1%. The deep learning-based data-driven respiratory phase-matched AC method improved the PET image quality and reduced the motion artifacts.

TITLE: Self-supervised parametric map estimation for multiplexed PET with a deep image prior

AUTHORS: Bolin Pan, Paul K Marsden, Andrew J Reader

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Multiplexed positron emission tomography (mPET) imaging allows simultaneous observation of physiological and pathological information from multiple tracers in a single PET scan. Although supervised deep learning has demonstrated superior performance in mPET image separation compared to purely model-based methods, acquiring large amounts of paired single-tracer data and multi-tracer data for training poses a practical challenge and needs extended scan durations for patients. In addition, the generalisation ability of the supervised learning framework is a concern, as the patient being scanned and their tracer kinetics may potentially fall outside the training distribution. In this work, we propose a self-supervised learning framework based on the deep image prior (DIP) for mPET image separation using just one dataset. In particular, we integrate the multi-tracer compartmental model into the DIP framework to estimate the parametric maps of each tracer from the measured dynamic dual-tracer activity images. Consequently, the separated dynamic single-tracer activity images can be recovered from the estimated tracer-specific parametric maps. In the proposed method, dynamic dual-tracer activity images are used as the training label, and the static dual-tracer image (reconstructed from the same patient data from the start to the end of acquisition) is used as the network input. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated on a simulated brain phantom for dynamic dual-tracer [18F]FDG+[11C]MET activity image separation and parametric map estimation. The results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the conventional voxel-wise multi-tracer compartmental modeling method (vMTCM) and the two-step method DIP-Dn+vMTCM (where dynamic dual-tracer activity images are first denoised using a U-net within the DIP framework, followed by vMTCM separation) in terms of lower bias and standard deviation in the separated single-tracer images and also for the estimated parametric maps for each tracer, at both voxel and ROI levels.

TITLE: 3D directional gradient L0 norm minimization guided limited-view reconstruction in a dual-panel positron emission mammography

AUTHORS: Yu Shi, Yirong Wang, Fanzhen Meng, Jianwei Zhou, Bo Wen, Xuexue Zhang, Yanyun Liu, Lei Li, Juntao Li, Xu Cao, Fei Kang, Shouping Zhu

JOURNAL: Computers in biology and medicine

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Background: Dual-panel PET is often used for local organ imaging, especially breast imaging, due to its simple structure, high sensitivity, good in-plane resolution, and straightforward fusion with other imaging modalities. Nevertheless, because of data loss caused by the dual-panel structure, using conventional image reconstruction methods results in limited-view artifacts and low image quality in dual-panel positron emission mammography (PEM), which may seriously affect the diagnosis. To mitigate the limited-view artifacts in the dual-panel PEM, we propose a 3D directional gradient L0norm minimization (3D-DL0) guided reconstruction method.

Methods: The detailed derivation and reasonable simplification of the 3D-DL0algorithm are given first. Using this algorithm, we then obtain a prior image with edge recovery but contrast loss. To limit the solution space, the 3D-DL0prior is introduced into the Maximum a Posteriori reconstruction. Meanwhile, a space-invariant point spread function is also implemented to restore image contrast and boundaries. Finally, the reconstructed images with limited-view artifact suppression are obtained. The proposed method was evaluated using the data acquired from physical phantoms and patients with breast tumors on a commercial dual-panel PET system.

Results: The qualitative and quantitative studies for phantom data and the blind reader study for clinical data show that the proposed method is more effective in reaching a balance between artifact elimination and image contrast improvement compared with various limited-view reconstruction methods. In addition, the iteration process of the method is proved convergent numerically.

Conclusions: The image quality improvement confirms the potential value of the proposed reconstruction algorithm to address the limited-view problem, and thus improve diagnostic accuracy in dual-panel PEM imaging.

TITLE: An objective evaluation method for head motion estimation in PET-Motion corrected centroid-of-distribution

AUTHORS: Chen Sun, Enette Mae Revilla, Jiazhen Zhang, Kathryn Fontaine, Takuya Toyonaga, Jean-Dominique Gallezot, Tim Mulnix, John A Onofrey, Richard E Carson, Yihuan Lu

JOURNAL: NeuroImage

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Head motion presents a continuing problem in brain PET studies. A wealth of motion correction (MC) algorithms had been proposed in the past, including both hardware-based methods and data-driven methods. However, in most real brain PET studies, in the absence of ground truth or gold standard of motion information, it is challenging to objectively evaluate MC quality. For MC evaluation, image-domain metrics, e.g., standardized uptake value (SUV) change before and after MC are commonly used, but this measure lacks objectivity because 1) other factors, e.g., attenuation correction, scatter correction and parameters used in the reconstruction, will confound MC effectiveness; 2) SUV only reflects final image quality, and it cannot precisely inform when an MC method performed well or poorly during the scan time period; 3) SUV is tracer-dependent and head motion may cause increases or decreases in SUV for different tracers, so evaluating MC effectiveness is complicated. Here, we present a new algorithm, i.e., motion corrected centroid-of-distribution (MCCOD) to perform objective quality control for measured or estimated rigid motion information. MCCOD is a three-dimensional surrogate trace of the center of tracer distribution after performing rigid MC using the existing motion information. MCCOD is used to inform whether the motion information is accurate, using the PET raw data only, i.e., without PET image reconstruction, where inaccurate motion information typically leads to abrupt changes in the MCCOD trace. MCCOD was validated using simulation studies and was tested on real studies acquired from both time-of-flight (TOF) and non-TOF scanners. A deep learning-based brain mask segmentation was implemented, which is shown to be necessary for non-TOF MCCOD generation. MCCOD is shown to be effective in detecting abrupt translation motion errors in slowly varying tracer distribution caused by the motion tracking hardware and can be used to compare different motion estimation methods as well as to improve existing motion information.

TITLE: Motion correction for PET data using subspace-based real-time MR imaging in simultaneous PET/MR

AUTHORS: Thibault Marin, Yanis Djebra, Paul K Han, Yanis Chemli, Isabelle Bloch, Georges El Fakhri, Jinsong Ouyang, Yoann Petibon, Chao Ma

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Image quality of positron emission tomography (PET) reconstructions is degraded by subject motion occurring during the acquisition. Magnetic resonance (MR)-based motion correction approaches have been studied for PET/MR scanners and have been successful at capturing regular motion patterns, when used in conjunction with surrogate signals (e.g. navigators) to detect motion. However, handling irregular respiratory motion and bulk motion remains challenging. In this work, we propose an MR-based motion correction method relying on subspace-based real-time MR imaging to estimate motion fields used to correct PET reconstructions. We take advantage of the low-rank characteristics of dynamic MR images to reconstruct high-resolution MR images at high frame rates from highly undersampled k-space data. Reconstructed dynamic MR images are used to determine motion phases for PET reconstruction and estimate phase-to-phase nonrigid motion fields able to capture complex motion patterns such as irregular respiratory and bulk motion. MR-derived binning and motion fields are used for PET reconstruction to generate motion-corrected PET images. The proposed method was evaluated on in vivo data with irregular motion patterns. MR reconstructions accurately captured motion, outperforming state-of-the-art dynamic MR reconstruction techniques. Evaluation of PET reconstructions demonstrated the benefits of the proposed method in terms of motion artifacts reduction, improving the contrast-to-noise ratio by up to a factor 3 and achieveing a target-to-background ratio up to 90% superior compared to standard/uncorrected methods. The proposed method can improve the image quality of motion-corrected PET reconstructions in clinical applications.

JOURNAL: Methods (San Diego, Calif.)

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Digitalization, especially the use of machine learning and computational intelligence, is considered to dramatically shape medical procedures in the near future. In the field of cancer diagnostics, radiomics, the extraction of multiple quantitative image features and their clustered analysis, is gaining increasing attention to obtain more detailed, reproducible, and meaningful information about the disease entity, its prognosis and the ideal therapeutic option. In this context, automation of diagnostic procedures can improve the entire pipeline, which comprises patient registration, planning and performing an imaging examination at the scanner, image reconstruction, image analysis, and feeding the diagnostic information from various sources into decision support systems. With a focus on cancer diagnostics, this review article reports and discusses how computer-assistance can be integrated into diagnostic procedures and which benefits and challenges arise from it. Besides a strong view on classical imaging modalities like x-ray, CT, MRI, ultrasound, PET, SPECT and hybrid imaging devices thereof, it is outlined how imaging data can be combined with data deriving from patient anamnesis, clinical chemistry, pathology, and different omics. In this context, the article also discusses IT infrastructures that are required to realize this integration in the clinical routine. Although there are still many challenges to comprehensively implement automated and integrated data analysis in molecular cancer imaging, the authors conclude that we are entering a new era of medical diagnostics and precision medicine.

TITLE: Deep learning-based attenuation correction for brain PET with various radiotracers

AUTHORS: Fumio Hashimoto, Masanori Ito, Kibo Ote, Takashi Isobe, Hiroyuki Okada, Yasuomi Ouchi

JOURNAL: Annals of nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Objectives: Attenuation correction (AC) is crucial for ensuring the quantitative accuracy of positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. However, obtaining accurate μ-maps from brain-dedicated PET scanners without AC acquisition mechanism is challenging. Therefore, to overcome these problems, we developed a deep learning-based PET AC (deep AC) framework to synthesize transmission computed tomography (TCT) images from non-AC (NAC) PET images using a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a huge dataset of various radiotracers for brain PET imaging.

Methods: The proposed framework is comprised of three steps: (1) NAC PET image generation, (2) synthetic TCT generation using CNN, and (3) PET image reconstruction. We trained the CNN by combining the mixed image dataset of six radiotracers to avoid overfitting, including [18F]FDG, [18F]BCPP-EF, [11C]Racropride, [11C]PIB, [11C]DPA-713, and [11C]PBB3. We used 1261 brain NAC PET and TCT images (1091 for training and 70 for testing). We did not include [11C]Methionine subjects in the training dataset, but included them in the testing dataset.

Results: The image quality of the synthetic TCT images obtained using the CNN trained on the mixed dataset of six radiotracers was superior to those obtained using the CNN trained on the split dataset generated from each radiotracer. In the [18F]FDG study, the mean relative PET biases of the emission-segmented AC (ESAC) and deep AC were 8.46 ± 5.24 and - 5.69 ± 4.97, respectively. The deep AC PET and TCT AC PET images exhibited excellent correlation for all seven radiotracers (R2= 0.912-0.982).

Conclusion: These results indicate that our proposed deep AC framework can be leveraged to provide quantitatively superior PET images when using the CNN trained on the mixed dataset of PET tracers than when using the CNN trained on the split dataset which means specific for each tracer.

TITLE: Evaluation Algorithm for the Effectiveness of Stroke Rehabilitation Treatment Using Cross-Modal Deep Learning

AUTHORS: Lei Wang, Rongxing Zhang, Qinming Yu

JOURNAL: Computational and mathematical methods in medicine

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
It is important to study the evaluation algorithm for the stroke rehabilitation treatment effect to make accurate evaluation and optimize the stroke disease treatment plan according to the evaluation results. To address the problems of poor restoration effect of positron emission tomography (PET) image and recognition restoration effect of evaluation data and so on. In the paper, we propose a stroke rehabilitation treatment effect evaluation algorithm based on cross-modal deep learning. Magnetic resonance images (MRI) and PET of stroke patients were collected as evaluation data to construct a multimodal evaluation dataset, and the data were divided into positive samples and negative samples. According to the mapping relationship between MRI and PET, three-dimensional cyclic adversarial is used to generate the neural network model to recover the missing PET data. Using the cross-modal depth learning network model, the RGB image, depth image, gray image, and normal images of MRI and PET are taken as the feature images and the multifeature fusion method is used to fuse the feature images, output the recognition results of MRI and PET, and evaluate the effect of stroke rehabilitation treatment according to the recognition results. The results show that the proposed algorithm can accurately restore PET images, the evaluation data recognition effect is good, and the evaluation data recognition accuracy is higher than 95%. The evaluation accuracy of stroke rehabilitation treatment effect is high, the evaluation time varies between 0.56 s and 0.91 s, and the practical application effect is good.

TITLE: Efficient Monte-Carlo based system modelling for image reconstruction in preclinical pinhole SPECT

AUTHORS: Minh Phuong Nguyen, Marlies C Goorden, Ruud M Ramakers, Freek J Beekman

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
The use of multi-pinhole collimation has enabled ultra-high-resolution imaging of SPECT and PET tracers in small animals. Key for obtaining high-quality images is the use of statistical iterative image reconstruction with accurate energy-dependent photon transport modelling through collimator and detector. This can be incorporated in a system matrix that contains the probabilities that a photon emitted from a certain voxel is detected at a specific detector pixel. Here we introduce a fast Monte-Carlo based (FMC-based) matrix generation method for pinhole imaging that is easy to apply to various radionuclides. The method is based on accelerated point source simulations combined with model-based interpolation to straightforwardly change or combine photon energies of the radionuclide of interest. The proposed method was evaluated for a VECTor PET-SPECT system with (i) a HE-UHR-M collimator and (ii) an EXIRAD-3D 3D autoradiography collimator. Both experimental scans with99mTc,111In, and123I, and simulated scans with67Ga and90Y were performed for evaluation. FMC was compared with two currently used approaches, one based on a set of point source measurements with99mTc (dubbed traditional method), and the other based on an energy-dependent ray-tracing simulation (ray-tracing method). The reconstruction results show better image quality when using FMC-based matrices than when applying the traditional or ray-tracing matrices in various cases. FMC-based matrices generalise better than the traditional matrices when imaging radionuclides with energies deviating too much from the energy used in the calibration and are computationally more efficient for very-high-resolution imaging than the ray-tracing matrices. In addition, FMC has the advantage of easily combining energies in a single matrix which is relevant when imaging radionuclides with multiple photopeak energies (e.g.67Ga and111In) or with a continuous energy spectrum (e.g.90Y). To conclude, FMC is an efficient, accurate, and versatile tool for creating system matrices for ultra-high-resolution pinhole SPECT.

JOURNAL: Journal of digital imaging

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
The aim of the study was to analyze the use of block sequential regularized expectation maximization (BSREM) with different β-values for the detection of brain metastases in digital fluorine-18 labeled 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-D-glucose (18F-FDG) PET/CT in lung cancer patients. We retrospectively analyzed staging/restaging 18F-FDG PET/CT scans of 40 consecutive lung cancer patients with new brain metastases, confirmed by MRI. PET images were reconstructed using BSREM (β-values of 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700) and OSEM. Two independent blinded readers (R1 and R2) evaluated each reconstruction using a 4-point scale for general image quality, noise, and lesion detectability. SUVmax of metastases, brain background, target-to-background ratio (TBR), and contrast recovery (CR) ratio were recorded for each reconstruction. Among all reconstruction techniques, differences in qualitative parameters were analyzed using non-parametric Friedman test, while differences in quantitative parameters were compared using analysis of variances for repeated measures. Cohen's kappa (k) was used to measure inter-reader agreement. The overall detectability of brain metastases was highest for BSREM200 (R1: 2.83 ± 1.17; R2: 2.68 ± 1.32) and BSREM300 (R1: 2.78 ± 1.23; R2: 2.68 ± 1.36), followed by BSREM100, which had lower accuracy owing to noise. The highest median TBR was found for BSREM100 (R1: 2.19 ± 1.05; R2: 2.42 ± 1.08), followed by BSREM200 and BSREM300. Image quality ratings were significantly different among reconstructions (p < 0.001). The median quality score was higher for BSREM100-300, and both noise and metastases' SUVmax decreased with increasing β-value. Inter-reader agreement was particularly high for the detectability of photopenic metastases and blurring (all k > 0.65). BSREM200 and BSREM300 yielded the best results for the detection of brain metastases, surpassing both BSREM400 and OSEM, typically used in clinical practice.

TITLE: Improved Alignment of PET and CT Images in Whole-Body PET/CT in Cases of Respiratory Motion During CT

AUTHORS: James J Hamill, Joseph G Meier, Sonia L Betancourt Cuellar, Bradley Sabloff, Jeremy J Erasmus, Osama Mawlawi

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Respiratory motion during the CT and PET parts of a PET/CT scan leads to imperfect alignment of anatomic features seen by the 2 modalities. In this work, we concentrate on the effects of motion during CT. We propose a novel approach for improving the alignment.Methods:Respiratory waveform data were gathered during the CT and PET parts of 28 PET/CT scans of cancer patients with 40 lesions up to 3 cm in size in the lung or upper abdomen. PET list-mode data were reconstructed by 3 reconstruction methods: PET/static (the standard method with no motion correction); PET/ex (a method that calculates a range of expiratory amplitudes from the lowest one to the highest one); and PET/matched (a novel method that uses both waveforms). The 3 methods were compared. The distance between tumor positions in PET and CT were characterized in visual interpretation by physicians as well as quantitatively. Tumor SUVs (SUVmaxand SUVpeak) were determined relative to SUV based on the static method. Image noise was evaluated in the liver and compared with PET/static.Results:In visual interpretation, the rate of good alignment was 13 of 21, 13 of 23, and 18 of 21 for the PET/static, PET/ex, and PET/matched methods, respectively, and the mean PET/CT distances were 3.5, 5.1, and 2.8 mm. In visual comparison with PET/ex, the rate of good alignment was increased in 1 of 10 and 7 of 10 cases for PET/static and PET/matched, respectively. SUVmaxwas on average 21% higher than PET/static when either PET/ex or PET/matched was used. SUVpeakwas 12% higher. Image noise in the liver was 15% higher than PET/static for the PET/ex method, and 40% higher for PET/matched; that is, noise was much lower than in gated PET.Conclusion:Acquiring respiratory waveforms both in PET (as in the current state of the art) and in CT (an unusual key step in this approach) has the potential to improve the alignment of PET and CT images. A proposed method for using this information was tested. Improved alignment was demonstrated.

JOURNAL: Seminars in nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Total body (TB) Positron Emission Tomography (PET) / Computed Tomography (CT) scanners have revolutionized nuclear medicine by enabling whole-body imaging in a single bed position.1This review assesses the physical and clinical value of TB-PET/CT, with a focus on the advancements in both static and dynamic imaging, as well as the evolving quantification techniques. The significantly enhanced sensitivity of TB scanners can reduce radiation exposure and scan time, offering improved patient comfort and making it particularly useful for pediatric imaging and various other scenarios. Shorter scan times also decrease motion artifacts, leading to higher-quality images and better diagnostic accuracy. Dynamic PET imaging with TB scanners extends these advantages by capturing temporal changes in tracer uptake over time, providing real-time insights into both structural and functional assessment, and promoting the ability to monitor disease progression and treatment response. We also present CT-free attenuation correction methods that utilize the increased sensitivity of TB-PET as a potential improvement for dynamic TB-PET protocols. In static imaging, emerging quantification techniques such as dual-tracer PET using TB scanners allow imaging of two biological pathways, simultaneously, for a more comprehensive assessment of disease. In addition, positronium imaging, a novel technique utilizing positronium lifetime measurements, is introduced as a promising aspect for providing structural information alongside functional quantification. Finally, the potential of expanding clinical applications with the increased sensitivity of TB-PET/CT scanners is discussed.

TITLE: Energy-based scatter estimation in clinical PET

AUTHORS: James J Hamill, Jorge Cabello, Suleman Surti, Joel S Karp

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Background: Scatter correction (SC) is essential in PET for accurate quantitative imaging. The state-of-the-art SC method is single-scatter simulation (SSS). Although this method is usually robust and accurate, it can fail in some situations, for example when there is motion between the CT and PET scans in PET/CT. Therefore, it is of interest to consider other SC methods.

Purpose: In this work, an energy-based scatter estimation (EBS) method is described in detail, tested in phantoms and patients, and compared to SSS.

Methods: This version of EBS was developed for list-mode data from Biograph Vision-600 PET/CT scanner. EBS is based on digitized 2D energy histograms in each bin of a coarsely sampled PET sinogram, either with or without time of flight (TOF). The histograms are modeled as a noisy realization of a linear combination of nine basis functions whose parameters were derived from a measurement of the 511-keV photopeak spectrum as well as Monte-Carlo simulations of the scattering process. EBS uses an iterative expectation maximization approach to determine the coefficients in the linear combination, and from this estimates the scatter. The investigation was restricted to18F-based PET data in which the acquired number of counts was similar to the levels seen in oncological whole-body PET/CT scans. To evaluate the performance, phantom scans were used that involved the NEMA NU2-2018 protocol, a slab phantom, an NU 2-1994 phantom, a cardiac phantom in an anthropomorphic chest phantom, and a uniformly-filled torso phantom with a bladder phantom slightly outside the axial field of view. Contrast recovery (CR) and other parameters were evaluated in images reconstructed with SSS and EBS. Furthermore, FDG PET scans of seven lung cancer patients were used in the evaluation. Standardized uptake values (SUV) based on SSS and EBS were compared in 27 lesions.

Results: EBS and SSS images were visually similar in all cases except the torso + bladder phantom, where the EBS was much closer to the expected uniform image. The NU2-2018 analysis indicated a 2% scatter residual in EBS images compared to 3% with SSS, and 10% higher background variability, which is a surrogate for image noise. The cardiac phantom scan showed that CR was 98.2% with EBS and 99.6% with SSS, and that the SSS sinogram had values greater than the net-true emission sinogram, indicating a slight overcorrection in the case of SSS. In the lesion SUV comparison in patient scans, EBS correlated strongly (R2= 0.9973) with SSS, and SUV based on EBS were systematically 0.1 SUV lower. In the case of the torso + bladder phantom portion, the SSS image of the torso + bladder phantom was 299% times hotter than expected in one area, due to scatter estimation error, compared to 16% colder with EBS.

Conclusions: In evaluating clinically relevant parameters such as SUV in focal lesions, EBS and SSS give almost the same results. In phantoms, some scatter figures of merit were slightly improved by use of EBS, though an image variability figure of merit was slightly degraded. In typical oncological whole-body PET/CT, EBS may be a suitable replacement for SSS, especially when SSS fails due to technical problems during the scan.

TITLE: Optimization of pediatric FDG-PET/CT examinations based on physical indicators using the SiPM-PET/CT system

AUTHORS: Yoshiki Owaki, Kazuya Minamishima, Kiyotaka Nakajima

JOURNAL: Nuclear medicine communications

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Objective: This study aimed to investigate the appropriate Silicon photomultiplier -PET/CT acquisition and image reconstruction conditions for each age group.

Methods: The original phantom was developed to reflect the thickness and width of the torso in each age group (neonates, 1-year-olds, 5-year-olds, 10-year-olds, 15-year-olds, and adults). The ratio of hot spheres to background radioactivity was 4:1, and the radioactivity concentration was adjusted according to the Japanese consensus guidelines for appropriate implementation of pediatric nuclear medicine examinations. We evaluated the root mean square error (RMSE) as an assessment/function of the standardized uptake value of each hot sphere, the background variability (N10 mm), the % contrast of the hot sphere (QH, 10 mm/N10 mm), and the noise equivalent counts to determine the optimal reconstruction parameters and the appropriate acquisition time.

Results: The minimum RMSE was obtained by setting the half-width of the Gaussian filter to 0-2 mm for iteration 1 or 2 and to 2-4 mm for iteration 3 or more. The acquisition times that satisfied the image quality equivalent to 120 s acquisitions in the adult phantoms were 30 s in the neonatal and 1-year-old phantoms, 60 s in the 5- and 10-year-old phantoms, and 75 s in the 15-year-old phantoms.

Conclusion: This study demonstrated that good PET images could be obtained with short acquisition times when the examination is performed under appropriate reconstruction conditions.

AUTHORS: Hui Li, Xiangxi Meng, Xiangping Guan, Nina Zhou, Hui Liu, Yan Zhang, Boqi Yu, Hua Zhu, Nan Li, Zhi Yang

JOURNAL: Clinical nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: The recently available gated T1-weighted imaging with the Dixon technique enables the synchronized gating signal for both MR acquisition and PET reconstruction. Herein, we evaluated the clinical value of this MR-gated PET reconstruction in the thoracic-abdominal PET/MRI compared with non-MR-gated method.

Methods: Twenty patients (28 hypermetabolic target lesions) underwent PET/MRI. Four types of PET images were reconstructed: non-MR-gating + gated attenuation correction (AC) (group A), MR-gating + gated AC (group B), non-MR-gating + breath-hold (BH) AC (group C), and MR-gating + BH AC (group D). A 4-point objective scale (from well match to obvious mismatch was scored from 3 to 0) was proposed to evaluate the mismatch. The detection rate and quantitative metrics were also evaluated.

Results: In the patient-based analysis, for groups A through D, the detection rates were 90%, 100%, 85%, and 90% as well as 95%, 100%, 85%, and 85%, assessed by readers 1 and 2, respectively, and significant difference of mismatch score was observed with the highest proportion of 3 points in group B (85%, 90%, 35%, and 40%, and 80%, 90%, 35%, and 20%, assessed by readers 1 and 2, respectively). The lesion-based analysis demonstrated significant differences in quantitative metrics for groups A through D (all P's < 0.05), with the highest quantitative metrics in group B (SUVmax: 7.49 ± 3.37, 8.45 ± 3.82, 6.90 ± 3.24, and 7.69 ± 3.50; SUVmean: 3.90 ± 1.60, 4.34 ± 1.84, 3.67 ± 1.61, and 4.03 ± 1.81; SUVpeak: 5.60 ± 2.50, 6.10 ± 2.80, 5.22 ± 2.40, and 5.65 ± 2.68; signal-to-noise ratio: 136.06 ± 90.58, 136.24 ± 81.63, 99.52 ± 53.16, and 107.57 ± 69.05).

Conclusions: The MR-gated reconstruction using gated AC reduced the mismatch between MR and PET images and improved the thoracic-abdominal PET image quality in simultaneous PET/MRI systems.

TITLE: Myocardial creep-induced misalignment artifacts in PET/MR myocardial perfusion imaging

AUTHORS: Elia von Felten, Georgios Benetos, Dimitri Patriki, Dominik C Benz, Georgios P Rampidis, Andreas A Giannopoulos, Adam Bakula, Christoph Gräni, Aju P Pazhenkottil, Catherine Gebhard, Tobias A Fuchs, Philipp A Kaufmann, Ronny R Buechel

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Misalignment between positron emission tomography (PET) datasets and attenuation correction (AC) maps is a potential source of artifacts in myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI). We assessed the impact of adenosine on the alignment of AC maps derived from magnetic resonance (MR) and PET datasets during MPI on a hybrid PET/MR scanner.

Methods: Twenty-eight volunteers underwent adenosine stress and rest 13N-ammonia MPI on a PET/MR. We acquired Dixon sequences for the creation of MRAC maps. After reconstruction of the original non-shifted PET images, we examined MRAC and PET datasets for cardiac spatial misalignment and, if necessary, reconstructed a second set of shifted PET images after manually adjusting co-registration. Summed rest, stress, and difference scores (SRS, SSS, and SDS) were compared between shifted and non-shifted PET images. Additionally, we measured the amount of cranial movement of the heart (i.e., myocardial creep) after termination of adenosine infusion.

Results: Realignment was necessary for 25 (89.3%) stress and 12 (42.9%) rest PET datasets. Median SRS, SSS, and SDS of the non-shifted images were 6 (IQR = 4-7), 12 (IQR = 7-18), and 8 (IQR = 2-11), respectively, and of the shifted images 2 (IQR = 1-6), 4 (IQR = 7-18), and 1 (IQR = 0-2), respectively. All three scores were significantly higher in non-shifted versus shifted images (all p < 0.05). The difference in SDS correlated moderately but significantly with the amount of myocardial creep (r = 0.541, p = 0.005).

Conclusion: Misalignment of MRAC and PET datasets commonly occurs during adenosine stress MPI on a hybrid PET/MR device, potentially leading to an increase in false-positive findings. Our results suggest that myocardial creep may substantially account for this and prompt for a careful review and correction of PET/MRAC data.

TITLE: Noise-aware system generative model (NASGM): positron emission tomography (PET) image simulation framework with observer validation studies

AUTHORS: Suya Li, Kaushik Dutta, Debojyoti Pal, Kooresh I Shoghi

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Background: Simulation of positron emission tomography (PET) images is critical in dynamic imaging protocol optimization, quantitative imaging metric development, deep learning applications, and virtual imaging trials. These applications rely heavily on large volumes of simulated PET data. However, the current state-of-the-art PET image simulation platform is time-prohibitive and computationally intensive. Although deep learning-based generative models have been widely applied to generate PET images, they often fail to adequately account for the differing acquisition times of PET images.

Purpose: This study seeks to develop and validate a novel deep learning-based method, the noise-aware system generative model (NASGM), to simulate PET images of different acquisition times.

Methods: NASGM is based on the conditional generative adversarial network and features a novel dual-domain discriminator that contains a spatial and a frequency branch to leverage information from both domains. A transformer-based structure is applied for the frequency discriminator because of its ability to encode positional information and capture global dependencies. The study is conducted on a simulated dataset, with a public PET/CT dataset as the input activity and attenuation maps, and an analytical PET simulation tool to simulate PET images of different acquisition times. Ablation studies are carried out to confirm the necessity of adopting the dual-domain discriminator. A comprehensive suite of evaluations, including image fidelity assessment, noise measurement, quantitative accuracy validation, task-based assessment, texture analysis, and human observer study, is performed to confirm the realism of generated images. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test with Bonferroni correction is applied to compare the NASGM with other networks in the ablation study at an adjusted p-value, and the alignment of features between the generated and target images is measured by the concordance correlation coefficient (CCC).

Results: The quantitative accuracy measured by the correlation of mean recovery coefficients of tumor groups, and the NASGM-generated images achieved CCC values of 0.95 across most of the acquisition times. This also illustrates NASGM's ability to replicate the partial volume effect in target images. Furthermore, NASGM was also demonstrated to generate images that exhibit noise characteristics and textures closely matching those in the target PET images. In a tumor detection task-based observer study, the synthesized images achieved comparable performance to target images in the clinically relevant task. In the two-alternative forced choice human observer study, human observers achieved an accuracy of ∼50% for all tested acquisition times, confirming that the synthesized and target images are visually indistinguishable for human observers. Moreover, NASGM displayed strong generalizability within the training range, successfully generating images of frame durations not included in the training dataset.

Conclusions: NASGM is developed and validated as a deep learning-based PET simulation framework that offers computationally efficient image generation compared to traditional methods, making it an ideal tool for producing large volumes of simulated PET image datasets across varying acquisition times. Furthermore, the dual-domain discriminator enhances the quality of generated images, while the noise-aware mechanism introduces realistic, controllable noise variability.

TITLE: Reducing Radiation Exposure to Paediatric Patients Undergoing [18F]FDG-PET/CT Imaging

AUTHORS: Hunor Kertész, Thomas Beyer, Kevin London, Hamda Saleh, David Chung, Ivo Rausch, Jacobo Cal-Gonzalez, Theo Kitsos, Peter L Kench

JOURNAL: Molecular imaging and biology

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: To investigate the possibility of reducing the injected activity for whole-body [18F]FDG-PET/CT studies of paediatric oncology patients and to assess the usefulness of time-of-flight (TOF) acquisition on PET image quality at reduced count levels.

Procedures: Twenty-nine paediatric oncology patients (12F/17M, 3-18 years old (median age 13y), weight 45±20 kg, BMI 19±4 kg/m2), who underwent routine whole-body PET/CT examinations on a Siemens Biograph mCT TrueV system with TOF capability (555ps) were included in this study. The mean injected activity was 156 ± 45 MBq (3.8 ± 0.8 kg/MBq) and scaled to patient weight. The raw data was collected in listmode (LM) format and pre-processed to simulate reduced levels of [18F]FDG activity (75, 50, 35, 20 and 10% of the original counts) by randomly removing events from the original LM data. All data were reconstructed using the vendor-specific e7-tools with standard OSEM only, with OSEM plus resolution recovery (PSF). The reconstructions were repeated with added TOF (TOF) and PSF+TOF. The benefit of TOF together with the reduced count levels was evaluated by calculating the gains in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the liver and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) in all PET-positive lesions before and after TOF employed at every simulated reduced count level. Finally, the PSF+TOF images at 50, 75 and 100% of counts were evaluated clinically on a 5-point scale by three nuclear medicine physicians.

Results: The visual inspection of the reconstructed images did not reveal significant differences in image quality between 75 and 100% count levels for PSF+TOF. The improvements in SNR and CNR were the greatest for TOF reconstruction and PSF combined. Both SNR and CNR gains did increase linearly with the patients BMI for both OSEM only and PSF reconstruction. These benefits were observed until reducing the counts to 50 and 35% for SNR and CNR, respectively.

Conclusions: The benefit of using TOF was noticeable when using 50% or greater of the counts when evaluating the CNR and SNR. For [18F]FDG-PET/CT, whole-body paediatric imaging the injected activity can be reduced to 75% of the original dose without compromising PET image quality.

TITLE: Cross-Modality Image Translation From Brain 18 F-FDG PET/CT Images to Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery Images Using the CypixGAN Framework

AUTHORS: Sangwon Lee, Jin Ho Jung, Yong Choi, Eunyeong Seok, Jiwoong Jung, Hyunkeong Lim, Dongwoo Kim, Mijin Yun

JOURNAL: Clinical nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: PET/CT and MRI can accurately diagnose dementia but are expensive and inconvenient for patients. Therefore, we aimed to generate synthetic fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images from 18 F-FDG PET and CT images of the human brain using a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based deep learning framework called the CypixGAN, which combined the CycleGAN framework with the L1 loss function of the pix2pix.

Patients and methods: Data from 143 patients who underwent PET/CT and MRI were used for training (n = 79), validation (n = 20), and testing (n = 44) the deep learning frameworks. Synthetic FLAIR images were generated using the pix2pix, CycleGAN, and CypixGAN, and white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) were then segmented. The performance of CypixGAN was compared with that of the other frameworks.

Results: The CypixGAN outperformed the pix2pix and CycleGAN in generating synthetic FLAIR images with superior visual quality. Peak signal-to-noise ratio and structural similarity index (mean ± standard deviation) estimated using the CypixGAN (20.23 ± 1.31 and 0.80 ± 0.02, respectively) were significantly higher than those estimated using the pix2pix (19.35 ± 1.43 and 0.79 ± 0.02, respectively) and CycleGAN (18.74 ± 1.49 and 0.78 ± 0.02, respectively) ( P < 0.001). WMHs in synthetic FLAIR images generated using the CypixGAN closely resembled those in ground-truth images, as indicated by the low absolute percentage volume differences and high dice similarity coefficients.

Conclusions: The CypixGAN generated high-quality FLAIR images owing to the preservation of spatial information despite using unpaired images. This framework may help improve diagnostic performance and cost-effectiveness of PET/CT when MRI scan is unavailable.

TITLE: Total-Body PET/CT: A Role of Artificial Intelligence?

AUTHORS: Qiyang Zhang, Zhenxing Huang, Yuxi Jin, Wenbo Li, Hairong Zheng, Dong Liang, Zhanli Hu

JOURNAL: Seminars in nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of the cutting-edge applications of artificial intelligence (AI) technology in total-body positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scanning technology and its profound impact on the field of medical imaging. The introduction of total-body PET/CT scanners marked a major breakthrough in medical imaging, as their superior sensitivity and ultralong axial fields of view allowed for high-quality PET images of the entire body to be obtained in a single scan, greatly enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of diagnoses. However, this advancement is accompanied by the challenges of increasing data volumes and data complexity levels, which pose severe challenges for traditional image processing and analysis methods. Given the excellent ability of AI technology to process massive and high-dimensional data, the combination of AI technology and ultrasensitive PET/CT can be considered a complementary match, opening a new path for rapidly improving the efficiency of the PET-based medical diagnosis process. Recently, AI technology has demonstrated extraordinary potential in several key areas related to total-body PET/CT, including radiation dose reductions, dynamic parametric imaging refinements, quantitative analysis accuracy improvements, and significant image quality enhancements. The accelerated adoption of AI in clinical practice is of particular interest and is directly driven by the rapid progress made by AI technologies in terms of interpretability; i.e., the decision-making processes of algorithms and models have become more transparent and understandable. In the future, we believe that AI technology will fundamentally reshape the use of PET/CT, not only playing a more critical role in clinical diagnoses but also facilitating the customization and implementation of personalized healthcare solutions, providing patients with safer, more accurate, and more efficient healthcare experiences.

TITLE: Deep-learning-based methods of attenuation correction for SPECT and PET

AUTHORS: Xiongchao Chen, Chi Liu

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear cardiology : official publication of the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Attenuation correction (AC) is essential for quantitative analysis and clinical diagnosis of single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET). In clinical practice, computed tomography (CT) is utilized to generate attenuation maps (μ-maps) for AC of hybrid SPECT/CT and PET/CT scanners. However, CT-based AC methods frequently produce artifacts due to CT artifacts and misregistration of SPECT-CT and PET-CT scans. Segmentation-based AC methods using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for PET/MRI scanners are inaccurate and complicated since MRI does not contain direct information of photon attenuation. Computational AC methods for SPECT and PET estimate attenuation coefficients directly from raw emission data, but suffer from low accuracy, cross-talk artifacts, high computational complexity, and high noise level. The recently evolving deep-learning-based methods have shown promising results in AC of SPECT and PET, which can be generally divided into two categories: indirect and direct strategies. Indirect AC strategies apply neural networks to transform emission, transmission, or MR images into synthetic μ-maps or CT images which are then incorporated into AC reconstruction. Direct AC strategies skip the intermediate steps of generating μ-maps or CT images and predict AC SPECT or PET images from non-attenuation-correction (NAC) SPECT or PET images directly. These deep-learning-based AC methods show comparable and even superior performance to non-deep-learning methods. In this article, we first discussed the principles and limitations of non-deep-learning AC methods, and then reviewed the status and prospects of deep-learning-based methods for AC of SPECT and PET.

ABSTRACT:
The collaboration of Yale, the University of California, Davis, and United Imaging Healthcare has successfully developed the NeuroEXPLORER, a dedicated human brain PET imager with high spatial resolution, high sensitivity, and a built-in 3-dimensional camera for markerless continuous motion tracking. It has high depth-of-interaction and time-of-flight resolutions, along with a 52.4-cm transverse field of view (FOV) and an extended axial FOV (49.5 cm) to enhance sensitivity. Here, we present the physical characterization, performance evaluation, and first human images of the NeuroEXPLORER.Methods:Measurements of spatial resolution, sensitivity, count rate performance, energy and timing resolution, and image quality were performed adhering to the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) NU 2-2018 standard. The system's performance was demonstrated through imaging studies of the Hoffman 3-dimensional brain phantom and the mini-Derenzo phantom. Initial18F-FDG images from a healthy volunteer are presented.Results:With filtered backprojection reconstruction, the radial and tangential spatial resolutions (full width at half maximum) averaged 1.64, 2.06, and 2.51 mm, with axial resolutions of 2.73, 2.89, and 2.93 mm for radial offsets of 1, 10, and 20 cm, respectively. The average time-of-flight resolution was 236 ps, and the energy resolution was 10.5%. NEMA sensitivities were 46.0 and 47.6 kcps/MBq at the center and 10-cm offset, respectively. A sensitivity of 11.8% was achieved at the FOV center. The peak noise-equivalent count rate was 1.31 Mcps at 58.0 kBq/mL, and the scatter fraction at 5.3 kBq/mL was 36.5%. The maximum count rate error at the peak noise-equivalent count rate was less than 5%. At 3 iterations, the NEMA image-quality contrast recovery coefficients varied from 74.5% (10-mm sphere) to 92.6% (37-mm sphere), and background variability ranged from 3.1% to 1.4% at a contrast of 4.0:1. An example human brain18F-FDG image exhibited very high resolution, capturing intricate details in the cortex and subcortical structures.Conclusion:The NeuroEXPLORER offers high sensitivity and high spatial resolution. With its long axial length, it also enables high-quality spinal cord imaging and image-derived input functions from the carotid arteries. These performance enhancements will substantially broaden the range of human brain PET paradigms, protocols, and thereby clinical research applications.

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
As the segment of diseased tissue in PET images is time-consuming, laborious and low accuracy, this work proposes an automated framework for PET image screening, denoising and diseased tissue segmentation. First, taking into account the characteristics of PET images, the framework uses a differential activation filter to select whole-body images containing lesion tissue. Second, a new neural network containing residual connections which has powerful generalization performance compared with normal FCN network is proposed for PET image reconstruction and denoising. Finally, in the segmentation of lesion tissues, a custom clustering algorithm based on the density is used to distinguishe the lesion tissue part from the normal tissue. Tests on real medical PET images show that the whole automated framework has good performance and time cost in PET lesion image screening, image denoising and lesion tissue segmentation compared with other algorithms. The framework shows promising scientific study and application prospects.

JOURNAL: Annals of nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Objective: The uptake of [11C]methionine in positron emission tomography (PET) imaging overlapped in earlier images of tumors. Bayesian penalized likelihood (BPL) reconstruction increases the quantitative values of tumors compared with conventional ordered subset-expectation maximization (OSEM). The present study aimed to grade glioma malignancy based on the new WHO 2021 classification using [11C]methionine PET images reconstructed using BPL.

Methods: We categorized 32 gliomas in 28 patients as grades 2/3 (n = 15) and 4 (n = 17) based on the WHO 2021 classification. All [11C]methionine images were reconstructed using OSEM + time-of-flight (TOF) and BPL + TOF (β = 200). Maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) and tumor-to-normal tissue ratio (T/Nmax) were measured at each lesion.

Results: The mean SUVmaxwas 4.65 and 4.93 in grade 2/3 and 6.38 and 7.11 in grade 4, and the mean T/Nmaxwas 7.08 and 7.22 in grade 2/3 and 9.30 and 10.19 in grade 4 for OSEM and BPL, respectively. The BPL significantly increased these values in grade 4 gliomas. The area under the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) for SUVmaxwas the highest (0.792) using BPL.

Conclusions: The BPL increased mean SUVmaxand mean T/Nmaxin lesions with higher contrast such as grade 4 glioma. The discrimination power between grades 2/3 and 4 in SUVmaxwas also increased using [11C]methionine PET images reconstructed with BPL.

TITLE: A virtual-pinhole PET device for improving contrast recovery and enhancing lesion detectability of a one-meter-long PET scanner: a simulation study

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
This paper presents a simulation study to demonstrate that the contrast recovery coefficients (CRC) and detectability of small lesions of a one-meter-long positron emission tomography (PET) scanner can be further enhanced by the integration of high resolution virtual-pinhole (VP) PET devices. The scanner under investigation is a Siemens Biograph Vision Quadra which has an axial field-of-view (FOV) of 106 cm. The VP-PET devices contain two high-resolution flat panel detectors, each composed of 2 × 8 detector modules each of which consists of 32 × 64 lutetium-oxyorthosilicate crystals (1.0 × 1.0 × 10.0 mm3each). Two configurations for the VP-PET device placement were evaluated: (1) place the two flat-panel detectors at the center of the scanner's axial FOV below the patient bed; (2) place one flat-panel detector at the center of the first and the last quarter of the scanner's axial FOV below the patient bed. Sensitivity profiles were measured by moving a point22Na source stepwise across the scanner's FOV axially at different locations. To assess the improvement in CRC and lesion detectability by the VP-PET devices, an elliptical torso phantom (31.6 × 22.8 × 106 cm3) was first imaged by the native scanner then subsequently by the two VP-PET geometry configurations. Spherical lesions (4 mm in diameter) having 5:1 lesion-to-background radioactivity concentration ratio were grouped and placed at nine regions in the phantom to analyze the dependence of the improvement in plane. Average CRCs and their standard deviations of the 7 tumors in each group were computed and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were drawn to evaluate the improvement in lesion detectability by the VP-PET device over the native long axial PET scanner. The fraction of coincidence events between the inserts and the scanner detectors was 13%-16% (out of the total number of coincidences) for VP-PET configuration 1 and 2, respectively. The VP-PET systems provide higher CRCs for lesions in all regions in the torso, with more significant enhancement at regions closer to the inserts, than the native scanner does. For any given false positive fraction, the VP-PET systems offer higher true positive fraction compared to the native scanner. This work provides a potential solution to further enhance the image resolution of a long axial FOV PET scanner to maximize its lesion detectability afforded by its super high effective sensitivity.

TITLE: Improving 18F-FDG PET Quantification Through a Spatial Normalization Method

AUTHORS: Daewoon Kim, Seung Kwan Kang, Seong A Shin, Hongyoon Choi, Jae Sung Lee

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Quantification of18F-FDG PET images is useful for accurate diagnosis and evaluation of various brain diseases, including brain tumors, epilepsy, dementia, and Parkinson disease. However, accurate quantification of18F-FDG PET images requires matched 3-dimensional T1MRI scans of the same individuals to provide detailed information on brain anatomy. In this paper, we propose a transfer learning approach to adapt a pretrained deep neural network model from amyloid PET to spatially normalize18F-FDG PET images without the need for 3-dimensional MRI.Methods:The proposed method is based on a deep learning model for automatic spatial normalization of18F-FDG brain PET images, which was developed by fine-tuning a pretrained model for amyloid PET using only 10318F-FDG PET and MR images. After training, the algorithm was tested on 65 internal and 78 external test sets. All T1MR images with a 1-mm isotropic voxel size were processed with FreeSurfer software to provide cortical segmentation maps used to extract a ground-truth regional SUV ratio using cerebellar gray matter as a reference region. These values were compared with those from spatial normalization-based quantification methods using the proposed method and statistical parametric mapping software.Results:The proposed method showed superior spatial normalization compared with statistical parametric mapping, as evidenced by increased normalized mutual information and better size and shape matching in PET images. Quantitative evaluation revealed a consistently higher SUV ratio correlation and intraclass correlation coefficients for the proposed method across various brain regions in both internal and external datasets. The remarkably good correlation and intraclass correlation coefficient values of the proposed method for the external dataset are noteworthy, considering the dataset's different ethnic distribution and the use of different PET scanners and image reconstruction algorithms.Conclusion:This study successfully applied transfer learning to a deep neural network for18F-FDG PET spatial normalization, demonstrating its resource efficiency and improved performance. This highlights the efficacy of transfer learning, which requires a smaller number of datasets than does the original network training, thus increasing the potential for broader use of deep learning-based brain PET spatial normalization techniques for various clinical and research radiotracers.

TITLE: Imaging coronary plaques using 3D motion-compensated [18F]NaF PET/MR

AUTHORS: Johannes Mayer, Thomas-Heinrich Wurster, Tobias Schaeffter, Ulf Landmesser, Andreas Morguet, Boris Bigalke, Bernd Hamm, Winfried Brenner, Marcus R Makowski, Christoph Kolbitsch

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Background: Cardiac PET has recently found novel applications in coronary atherosclerosis imaging using [18F]NaF as a radiotracer, highlighting vulnerable plaques. However, the resulting uptakes are relatively small, and cardiac motion and respiration-induced movement of the heart can impair the reconstructed images due to motion blurring and attenuation correction mismatches. This study aimed to apply an MR-based motion compensation framework to [18F]NaF data yielding high-resolution motion-compensated PET and MR images.

Methods: Free-breathing 3-dimensional Dixon MR data were acquired, retrospectively binned into multiple respiratory and cardiac motion states, and split into fat and water fraction using a model-based reconstruction framework. From the dynamic MR reconstructions, both a non-rigid cardiorespiratory motion model and a motion-resolved attenuation map were generated and applied to the PET data to improve image quality. The approach was tested in 10 patients and focal tracer hotspots were evaluated concerning their target-to-background ratio, contrast-to-background ratio, and their diameter.

Results: MR-based motion models were successfully applied to compensate for physiological motion in both PET and MR. Target-to-background ratios of identified plaques improved by 7 ± 7%, contrast-to-background ratios by 26 ± 38%, and the plaque diameter decreased by -22 ± 18%. MR-based dynamic attenuation correction strongly reduced attenuation correction artefacts and was not affected by stent-related signal voids in the underlying MR reconstructions.

Conclusions: The MR-based motion correction framework presented here can improve the target-to-background, contrast-to-background, and width of focal tracer hotspots in the coronary system. The dynamic attenuation correction could effectively mitigate the risk of attenuation correction artefacts in the coronaries at the lung-soft tissue boundary. In combination, this could enable a more reproducible and reliable plaque localisation.

TITLE: Spach Transformer: Spatial and Channel-Wise Transformer Based on Local and Global Self-Attentions for PET Image Denoising

AUTHORS: Se-In Jang, Tinsu Pan, Ye Li, Pedram Heidari, Junyu Chen, Quanzheng Li, Kuang Gong

JOURNAL: IEEE transactions on medical imaging

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Position emission tomography (PET) is widely used in clinics and research due to its quantitative merits and high sensitivity, but suffers from low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Recently convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely used to improve PET image quality. Though successful and efficient in local feature extraction, CNN cannot capture long-range dependencies well due to its limited receptive field. Global multi-head self-attention (MSA) is a popular approach to capture long-range information. However, the calculation of global MSA for 3D images has high computational costs. In this work, we proposed an efficient spatial and channel-wise encoder-decoder transformer, Spach Transformer, that can leverage spatial and channel information based on local and global MSAs. Experiments based on datasets of different PET tracers, i.e., 18F-FDG, 18F-ACBC, 18F-DCFPyL, and 68Ga-DOTATATE, were conducted to evaluate the proposed framework. Quantitative results show that the proposed Spach Transformer framework outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning architectures.

ABSTRACT:
Objective.Simulation of positron emission tomography (PET) images is an essential tool in the development and validation of quantitative imaging workflows and advanced image processing pipelines. Existing Monte Carlo or analytical PET simulators often compromise on either efficiency or accuracy. We aim to develop and validate fast analytical simulator of tracer (FAST)-PET, a novel analytical framework, to simulate PET images accurately and efficiently.Approach. FAST-PET simulates PET images by performing precise forward projection, scatter, and random estimation that match the scanner geometry and statistics. Although the same process should be applicable to other scanner models, we focus on the Siemens Biograph Vision-600 in this work. Calibration and validation of FAST-PET were performed through comparison with an experimental scan of a National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) Image Quality (IQ) phantom. Further validation was conducted between FAST-PET and Geant4 Application for Tomographic Emission (GATE) quantitatively in clinical image simulations in terms of intensity-based and texture-based features and task-based tumor segmentation.Main results.According to the NEMA IQ phantom simulation, FAST-PET's simulated images exhibited partial volume effects and noise levels comparable to experimental images, with a relative bias of the recovery coefficient RC within 10% for all spheres and a coefficient of variation for the background region within 6% across various acquisition times. FAST-PET generated clinical PET images exhibit high quantitative accuracy and texture comparable to GATE (correlation coefficients of all features over 0.95) but with ∼100-fold lower computation time. The tumor segmentation masks comparison between both methods exhibited significant overlap and shape similarity with high concordance CCC > 0.97 across measures.Significance.FAST-PET generated PET images with high quantitative accuracy comparable to GATE, making it ideal for applications requiring extensive PET image simulations such as virtual imaging trials, and the development and validation of image processing pipelines.

TITLE: Deep generative denoising networks enhance quality and accuracy of gated cardiac PET data

AUTHORS: Mojtaba Jafaritadi, Jarmo Teuho, Eero Lehtonen, Riku Klén, Antti Saraste, Craig S Levin

JOURNAL: Annals of nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Background: Cardiac positron emission tomography (PET) can visualize and quantify the molecular and physiological pathways of cardiac function. However, cardiac and respiratory motion can introduce blurring that reduces PET image quality and quantitative accuracy. Dual cardiac- and respiratory-gated PET reconstruction can mitigate motion artifacts but increases noise as only a subset of data are used for each time frame of the cardiac cycle.

Aim: The objective of this study is to create a zero-shot image denoising framework using a conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs) for improving image quality and quantitative accuracy in non-gated and dual-gated cardiac PET images.

Methods: Our study included retrospective list-mode data from 40 patients who underwent an18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) cardiac PET study. We initially trained and evaluated a 3D cGAN-known as Pix2Pix-on simulated non-gated low-count PET data paired with corresponding full-count target data, and then deployed the model on an unseen test set acquired on the same PET/CT system including both non-gated and dual-gated PET data.

Results: Quantitative analysis demonstrated that the 3D Pix2Pix network architecture achieved significantly (p value<0.05) enhanced image quality and accuracy in both non-gated and gated cardiac PET images. At 5%, 10%, and 15% preserved count statistics, the model increased peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) by 33.7%, 21.2%, and 15.5%, structural similarity index (SSIM) by 7.1%, 3.3%, and 2.2%, and reduced mean absolute error (MAE) by 61.4%, 54.3%, and 49.7%, respectively. When tested on dual-gated PET data, the model consistently reduced noise, irrespective of cardiac/respiratory motion phases, while maintaining image resolution and accuracy. Significant improvements were observed across all gates, including a 34.7% increase in PSNR, a 7.8% improvement in SSIM, and a 60.3% reduction in MAE.

Conclusion: The findings of this study indicate that dual-gated cardiac PET images, which often have post-reconstruction artifacts potentially affecting diagnostic performance, can be effectively improved using a generative pre-trained denoising network.

TITLE: Deep learning-based attenuation map generation with simultaneously reconstructed PET activity and attenuation and low-dose application

AUTHORS: Luyao Shi, Jiazhen Zhang, Takuya Toyonaga, Dan Shao, John A Onofrey, Yihuan Lu

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Objective. In PET/CT imaging, CT is used for positron emission tomography (PET) attenuation correction (AC). CT artifacts or misalignment between PET and CT can cause AC artifacts and quantification errors in PET. Simultaneous reconstruction (MLAA) of PET activity (λ-MLAA) and attenuation (μ-MLAA) maps was proposed to solve those issues using the time-of-flight PET raw data only. However,λ-MLAA still suffers from quantification error as compared to reconstruction using the gold-standard CT-based attenuation map (μ-CT). Recently, a deep learning (DL)-based framework was proposed to improve MLAA by predictingμ-DL fromλ-MLAA andμ-MLAA using an image domain loss function (IM-loss). However, IM-loss does not directly measure the AC errors according to the PET attenuation physics. Our preliminary studies showed that an additional physics-based loss function can lead to more accurate PET AC. The main objective of this study is to optimize the attenuation map generation framework for clinical full-dose18F-FDG studies. We also investigate the effectiveness of the optimized network on predicting attenuation maps for synthetic low-dose oncological PET studies.Approach. We optimized the proposed DL framework by applying different preprocessing steps and hyperparameter optimization, including patch size, weights of the loss terms and number of angles in the projection-domain loss term. The optimization was performed based on 100 skull-to-toe18F-FDG PET/CT scans with minimal misalignment. The optimized framework was further evaluated on 85 clinical full-dose neck-to-thigh18F-FDG cancer datasets as well as synthetic low-dose studies with only 10% of the full-dose raw data.Main results. Clinical evaluation of tumor quantification as well as physics-based figure-of-merit metric evaluation validated the promising performance of our proposed method. For both full-dose and low-dose studies, the proposed framework achieved <1% error in tumor standardized uptake value measures.Significance. It is of great clinical interest to achieve CT-less PET reconstruction, especially for low-dose PET studies.

TITLE: Comparison of deep learning-based emission-only attenuation correction methods for positron emission tomography

AUTHORS: Donghwi Hwang, Seung Kwan Kang, Kyeong Yun Kim, Hongyoon Choi, Jae Sung Lee

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: This study aims to compare two approaches using only emission PET data and a convolution neural network (CNN) to correct the attenuation (μ) of the annihilation photons in PET.

Methods: One of the approaches uses a CNN to generate μ-maps from the non-attenuation-corrected (NAC) PET images (μ-CNNNAC). In the other method, CNN is used to improve the accuracy of μ-maps generated using maximum likelihood estimation of activity and attenuation (MLAA) reconstruction (μ-CNNMLAA). We investigated the improvement in the CNN performance by combining the two methods (μ-CNNMLAA+NAC) and the suitability of μ-CNNNACfor providing the scatter distribution required for MLAA reconstruction. Image data from18F-FDG (n = 100) or68Ga-DOTATOC (n = 50) PET/CT scans were used for neural network training and testing.

Results: The error of the attenuation correction factors estimated using μ-CT and μ-CNNNACwas over 7%, but that of scatter estimates was only 2.5%, indicating the validity of the scatter estimation from μ-CNNNAC. However, CNNNACprovided less accurate bone structures in the μ-maps, while the best results in recovering the fine bone structures were obtained by applying CNNMLAA+NAC. Additionally, the μ-values in the lungs were overestimated by CNNNAC. Activity images (λ) corrected for attenuation using μ-CNNMLAAand μ-CNNMLAA+NACwere superior to those corrected using μ-CNNNAC, in terms of their similarity to λ-CT. However, the improvement in the similarity with λ-CT by combining the CNNNACand CNNMLAAapproaches was insignificant (percent error for lung cancer lesions, λ-CNNNAC= 5.45% ± 7.88%; λ-CNNMLAA= 1.21% ± 5.74%; λ-CNNMLAA+NAC= 1.91% ± 4.78%; percent error for bone cancer lesions, λ-CNNNAC= 1.37% ± 5.16%; λ-CNNMLAA= 0.23% ± 3.81%; λ-CNNMLAA+NAC= 0.05% ± 3.49%).

Conclusion: The use of CNNNACwas feasible for scatter estimation to address the chicken-egg dilemma in MLAA reconstruction, but CNNMLAAoutperformed CNNNAC.

ABSTRACT:
PET radiomics applied to oncology allow the measurement of intratumoral heterogeneity. This quantification can be affected by image protocols; hence, there is an increased interest in understanding how radiomic expression on PET images is affected by different imaging conditions. To address that interest, this study explored how radiomic features are affected by changes in18F-FDG uptake time, image reconstruction, lesion delineation, and radiomic binning settings.Methods:Ten non-small cell lung cancer patients underwent18F-FDG PET on 2 consecutive days. On each day, scans were obtained at 60 and 90 min after injection and reconstructed following EARL version 1 and with point-spread-function resolution modeling (PSF-EARL2). Lesions were delineated with an SUV threshold of 4.0, with 40% of SUVmax, and with a contrast-based isocontour. PET image intensity was discretized with both a fixed bin width (FBW) and a fixed bin number before the calculation of the radiomic features. Repeatability of features was measured with the intraclass correlation coefficient, and the change in feature value over time was calculated as a function of its repeatability. Features were then classified into use-case scenarios based on their repeatability and susceptibility to tracer uptake time.Results:With PSF-EARL2 reconstruction, 40% of SUVmaxlesion delineation, and FBW intensity discretization, most features (94%) were repeatable at both uptake times (intraclass correlation coefficient > 0.9), 35% being classified for dual-time-point use cases as being sensitive to changes in uptake time, 39% were classified for cross-sectional studies with an unclear dependency on time, 20% were classified for cross-sectional use while being robust to uptake time changes, and 6% were discarded for poor repeatability. EARL version 1 images had 1 fewer repeatable feature (neighborhood gray-level different matrix coarseness) than PSF-EARL2; the contrast-based delineation had the poorest repeatability of the delineation methods, with 45% of features being discarded; and fixed bin number resulted in lower repeatability than FBW (45% and 6% of features were discarded, respectively).Conclusion:Repeatability was maximized with PSF-EARL2 reconstruction, lesion delineation at 40% of SUVmax, and FBW intensity discretization. On the basis of their susceptibility to uptake time, radiomic features were classified into specific non-small cell lung cancer PET radiomics use cases.

TITLE: Comparison of ordered-subset expectation maximization and filtered back projection reconstruction based on quantitative outcome from dynamic [18F]NaF PET images

AUTHORS: James M Wong, Tanuj Puri, Muhammad Musib Siddique, Michelle L Frost, Amelia E B Moore, Glen M Blake, Ignac Fogelman

JOURNAL: Nuclear medicine communications

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
[18F]NaF PET imaging is a useful tool for measuring regional bone metabolism. However, due to tracer in urine, [18F]NaF PET images of the hip reconstructed using filtered back projection (FBP) frequently show streaking artifacts in slices through the bladder leading to noisy time-activity curves unsuitable for quantification. This study compares differences between quantitative outcomes at the hip derived from images reconstructed using the FBP and ordered-subset expectation maximization (OSEM) methods. Dynamic [18F]NaF PET data at the hip for four postmenopausal women were reconstructed using FBP and nine variations of the OSEM algorithm (all combinations of 1, 5, 15 iterations and 10, 15, 21 subsets). Seven volumes of interest were placed in the hip. Bone metabolism was measured using standardized uptake values, Patlak analysis (Ki-PAT) and Hawkins model Ki-4k. Percentage differences between the standardized uptake values and Ki values from FBP and OSEM images were assessed. OSEM images appeared visually smoother and without the streaking artifacts seen with FBP. However, due to loss of counts, they failed to recover the quantitative values in VOIs close to the bladder, including the femoral head and femoral neck. This was consistent for all quantification methods. Volumes of interest farther from the bladder or larger and receiving greater counts showed good convergence with 5 iterations and 21 subsets. For VOIs close to the bladder, including the femoral neck and femoral head, 15 iterations and 10, 15 or 21 subsets were not enough to obtain OSEM images suitable for measuring bone metabolism and showed no improvement compared to FBP.

ABSTRACT:
SIRF is a powerful PET/MR image reconstruction research tool for processing data and developing new algorithms. In this research, new developments to SIRF are presented, with focus on motion estimation and correction. SIRF's recent inclusion of the adjoint of the resampling operator allows gradient propagation through resampling, enabling the MCIR technique. Another enhancement enabled registering and resampling of complex images, suitable for MRI. Furthermore, SIRF's integration with the optimization library CIL enables the use of novel algorithms. Finally, SPM is now supported, in addition to NiftyReg, for registration. Results of MR and PET MCIR reconstructions are presented, using FISTA and PDHG, respectively. These demonstrate the advantages of incorporating motion correction and variational and structural priors. This article is part of the theme issue 'Synergistic tomographic image reconstruction: part 2'.

AUTHORS: Yutaka Natsuaki, Andrew Leynes, Kristen Wangerin, Mahdjoub Hamdi, Abhejit Rajagopal, Paul E Kinahan, Richard Laforest, Peder E Z Larson, Thomas A Hope, Sara St James

JOURNAL: Journal of applied clinical medical physics

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Background: In modern positron emission tomography (PET) with multi-modality imaging (e.g., PET/CT and PET/MR), the attenuation correction (AC) is the single largest correction factor for image reconstruction. One way to assess AC methods and other reconstruction parameters is to utilize software-based simulation tools, such as a lesion insertion tool. Extensive validation of these simulation tools is required to ensure results of the study are clinically meaningful.

Purpose: To evaluate different PET AC methods using a synthetic lesion insertion tool that simulates lesions in a patient cohort that has both PET/MR and PET/CT images. To further demonstrate how lesion insertion tool may be used to extend knowledge of PET reconstruction parameters, including but not limited to AC.

Methods: Lesion quantitation is compared using conventional Dixon-based MR-based AC (MRAC) to that of using CT-based AC (CTAC, a "ground truth"). First, the pre-existing lesions were simulated in a similar environment; a total of 71 lesions were identified in 18 pelvic PET/MR patient images acquired with a time-of-flight simultaneous PET/MR scanner, and matched lesions were inserted contralaterally on the same axial slice. Second, synthetic lesions were inserted into four anatomic target locations in a cohort of four patients who didn't have any observed clinical lesions in the pelvis.

Results: The matched lesion insertions resulted in unity between the lesion error ratios (mean SUVs), demonstrating that the inserted lesions successfully simulated the original lesions. In the second study, the inserted lesions had distinct characteristics by target locations and demonstrated negative max-SUV%diff trends for bone-dominant sites across the patient cohort.

Conclusions: The current work demonstrates that the applied lesion insertion tool can simulate uptake in pelvic lesions and their expected SUV values, and that the lesion insertion tool can be extended to evaluate further PET reconstruction corrections and algorithms and their impact on quantitation accuracy and precision.

TITLE: MR-Guided PET Reconstruction: A Potential Advancement for Patients With Epilepsy

AUTHORS: Martin W Huellner, Alexander Maurer, Matthew Spangler-Bickell

JOURNAL: Clinical nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
We report a case of a 33-year-old man with epilepsy and equivocal EEG, MRI signs of mesiotemporal sclerosis, and nondiagnostic standard FDG-PET imaging. The patient underwent repeat FDG-PET/MRI to clarify the sidedness of the epileptogenic focus and to confirm the suspected MTS. The standard PET reconstruction using block sequential regularized expectation maximization failed to provide evidence of a clear epileptogenic focus. However, using MR-guided PET reconstruction, circumscribed hypometabolism was observed in the right-sided entorhinal cortex, compatible with the epileptogenic focus. The MR-guided PET reconstruction provided significantly improved gray/white matter differentiation, enhancing confidence in imaging interpretation.

TITLE: Cardiac atrial metabolism quantitative assessment with analog and digital time of flight-PET/computed tomography

AUTHORS: Michel Hesse, Sébastien Marchandise, Bernhard Gerber, Véronique Roelants

JOURNAL: Nuclear medicine communications

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Background: Evaluation of left atrium (LA) remodeling is becoming increasingly relevant in understanding several pathological cardiac conditions. 18 F-FDG-PET/computed tomography (CT), the current gold standard for metabolic evaluation of the left ventricle, could be extended to LA using the latest PET technologies. We sought to perform a phantom study to optimize the reconstruction algorithm in this context.

Methods: The liver, heart cavity and walls of an anthropomorphic phantom were filled with typical patient 18 F-FDG activity concentrations. Acquisitions were performed on an analog and on a digital TOF-PET/CT, and reconstructed with and without resolution recovery (RR). The Richardson-Lucy RR method was used, either through a third-party software or through the PET/CT manufacturer algorithm. Activity recoveries in the atria and ventricles and signal-to-noise ratios were evaluated to identify the best reconstruction and RR parameters. The same methodology was applied on a patient cardiac study.

Results: Analog PET/CT with the third-party RR cannot improve the activity recovery without markedly degrading the image quality. For the digital PET/CT, the optimal algorithm was the manufacturer RR reconstruction using four iterations and 15 subsets combined with five RR iterations. This reconstruction improved the LA activity recovery from 58% to 70% while preserving images of diagnostic quality. Similar results were obtained for the patient study.

Conclusion: The digital TOF-PET/CT with the identified optimal reconstruction can be used to quantitatively analyze the LA uptake in 18 F-FDG cardiac studies while still preserving image reading quality. This may lead to more precise cardiovascular disease status evaluation, especially when atria are concerned.

TITLE: 3D PET/CT tumor segmentation based on nnU-Net with GCN refinement

AUTHORS: Hengzhi Xue, Qingqing Fang, Yudong Yao, Yueyang Teng

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Objective. Whole-body positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scans are an important tool for diagnosing various malignancies (e.g. malignant melanoma, lymphoma, or lung cancer), and accurate segmentation of tumors is a key part of subsequent treatment. In recent years, convolutional neural network based segmentation methods have been extensively investigated. However, these methods often give inaccurate segmentation results, such as oversegmentation and undersegmentation. To address these issues, we propose a postprocessing method based on a graph convolutional network (GCN) to refine inaccurate segmentation results and improve the overall segmentation accuracy.Approach. First, nnU-Net is used as an initial segmentation framework, and the uncertainty in the segmentation results is analyzed. Certain and uncertain pixels are used to establish the nodes of a graph. Each node and its 6 neighbors form an edge, and 32 nodes are randomly selected as uncertain nodes to form edges. The highly uncertain nodes are used as the subsequent refinement targets. Second, the nnU-Net results of the certain nodes are used as labels to form a semisupervised graph network problem, and the uncertain part is optimized by training the GCN to improve the segmentation performance. This describes our proposed nnU-Net + GCN segmentation framework.Main results.We perform tumor segmentation experiments with the PET/CT dataset from the MICCIA2022 autoPET challenge. Among these data, 30 cases are randomly selected for testing, and the experimental results show that the false-positive rate is effectively reduced with nnU-Net + GCN refinement. In quantitative analysis, there is an improvement of 2.1% for the average Dice score, 6.4 for the 95% Hausdorff distance (HD95), and 1.7 for the average symmetric surface distance.Significance. The quantitative and qualitative evaluation results show that GCN postprocessing methods can effectively improve the tumor segmentation performance.

TITLE: Phantom and methodology for comparison of small lesion detectability in PET

AUTHORS: Scott D Wollenweber, Adam M Alessio, Paul E Kinahan

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: The main goal of this work is to describe a phantom design, data acquisition and data analysis methodology enabling comparison of small lesion detectability between PET imaging systems and reconstruction algorithms. Several methods are currently available to characterize intrinsic and image quality performance, but none focus exclusively on small lesion detectability.

Methods: We previously developed a small-lesion detection phantom and described initial results using a head-size phantom. Unlike most fillable nuclear medicine phantoms, this phantom offers a semi-realistic heterogenous background and wall-less contrast features. In this work, the methodology is extended to include (a) the use of both head- and body-sized phantoms and (b) a multi-scan data collection and analysis method. We present an example use case of the phantom and detection estimation methodology, comparing the small-lesion detection performance across four commercial PET/CT systems.

Results: Repeat acquisitions of the phantom enabled estimation of model observer performance and surrogates of detectability. As anticipated, estimated detectability increased with the square root of system sensitivity and TOF offered marked improvement in detectability, especially for the body sized object. The proposed approach characterizing detectability at different times during the decay of the phantom enabled comparison of small lesion detectability at matched activity concentrations (and scan durations) across different scanners.

Conclusion: The proposed approach offers a reproducible tool for evaluating relative tradeoffs of system performance on small lesion detectability.

ABSTRACT:
BackgroundThe primary challenges in PET/MR imaging include prolonged scan durations for both PET and MR components and radiation exposure associated with the PET modality. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based techniques offer a promising approach to overcome these limitations.ObjectiveThis study evaluates the AI-based image enhancement methods integrated into the United Imaging PET/MR system, focusing on improvements in image quality, reduced injection dose, and shortened acquisition duration.MethodSixty-three patients underwent18F-FDG PET/MR scans using uPMR790 (0.09 ± 0.01 mCi/kg, 5 min/bed, n = 29) and uPMR890 (0.05 ± 0.01 mCi/kg, 2.5 min/bed for PET and accelerated MR protocols, n = 34) with advanced AI-enhanced method. Shortened MR protocols included T1 W and T2 W sequences. Image quality was evaluated subjectively by two physicians and objectively using SNR and artifact ratios.ResultsThe AI-enhanced system achieved high-quality PET and MR images despite reduced PET doses and scan durations for both PET and MR components. AI-based reconstruction images showed higher SNR, fewer artifacts, and reduced noise compared to the conventional system.ConclusionsAI-enhanced PET/MR significantly improves imaging efficiency by reducing PET/MR acquisition durations, lowering radiation dose, and enhancing overall image quality, making it a valuable tool for clinical hybrid imaging.

TITLE: 3D Segmentation Guided Style-Based Generative Adversarial Networks for PET Synthesis

AUTHORS: Yang Zhou, Zhiwen Yang, Hui Zhang, Eric I-Chao Chang, Yubo Fan, Yan Xu

JOURNAL: IEEE transactions on medical imaging

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Potential radioactive hazards in full-dose positron emission tomography (PET) imaging remain a concern, whereas the quality of low-dose images is never desirable for clinical use. So it is of great interest to translate low-dose PET images into full-dose. Previous studies based on deep learning methods usually directly extract hierarchical features for reconstruction. We notice that the importance of each feature is different and they should be weighted dissimilarly so that tiny information can be captured by the neural network. Furthermore, the synthesis on some regions of interest is important in some applications. Here we propose a novel segmentation guided style-based generative adversarial network (SGSGAN) for PET synthesis. (1) We put forward a style-based generator employing style modulation, which specifically controls the hierarchical features in the translation process, to generate images with more realistic textures. (2) We adopt a task-driven strategy that couples a segmentation task with a generative adversarial network (GAN) framework to improve the translation performance. Extensive experiments show the superiority of our overall framework in PET synthesis, especially on those regions of interest.

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
We perform a parametric study of the newly developed time-of-flight (TOF) image reconstruction algorithm, proposed for the real-time imaging in total-body Jagiellonian PET (J-PET) scanners. The asymmetric 3D filtering kernel is applied at each most likely position of electron-positron annihilation, estimated from the emissions of back-to-back γ-photons. The optimisation of its parameters is studied using Monte Carlo simulations of a 1-mm spherical source, NEMA IEC and XCAT phantoms inside the ideal J-PET scanner. The combination of high-pass filters which included the TOF filtered back-projection (FBP), resulted in spatial resolution, 1.5 times higher in the axial direction than for the conventional 3D FBP. For realistic 10-minute scans of NEMA IEC and XCAT, which require a trade-off between the noise and spatial resolution, the need for Gaussian TOF kernel components, coupled with median post-filtering, is demonstrated. The best sets of 3D filter parameters were obtained by the Nelder-Mead minimisation of the mean squared error between the resulting and reference images. The approach allows training the reconstruction algorithm for custom scans, using the IEC phantom, when the temporal resolution is below 50 ps. The image quality parameters, estimated for the best outcomes, were systematically better than for the non-TOF FBP.

Since the seventies, positron emission tomography (PET) has become an invaluable medical molecular imaging modality with an unprecedented sensitivity at the picomolar level, especially for cancer diagnosis and the monitoring of its response to therapy. More recently, its combination with x-ray computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR) has added high precision anatomic information in fused PET/CT and PET/MR images, thus compensating for the modest intrinsic spatial resolution of PET. Nevertheless, a number of medical challenges call for further improvements in PET sensitivity. These concern in particular new treatment opportunities in the context personalized (also called precision) medicine, such as the need to dynamically track a small number of cells in cancer immunotherapy or stem cells for tissue repair procedures. A better signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the image would allow detecting smaller size tumours together with a better staging of the patients, thus increasing the chances of putting cancer in complete remission. Moreover, there is an increasing demand for reducing the radioactive doses injected to the patients without impairing image quality. There are three ways to improve PET scanner sensitivity: improving detector efficiency, increasing geometrical acceptance of the imaging device and pushing the timing performance of the detectors. Currently, some pre-localization of the electron-positron annihilation along a line-of-response (LOR) given by the detection of a pair of annihilation photons is provided by the detection of the time difference between the two photons, also known as the time-of-flight (TOF) difference of the photons, whose accuracy is given by the coincidence time resolution (CTR). A CTR of about 10 picoseconds FWHM will ultimately allow to obtain a direct 3D volume representation of the activity distribution of a positron emitting radiopharmaceutical, at the millimetre level, thus introducing a quantum leap in PET imaging and quantification and fostering more frequent use of11C radiopharmaceuticals. The present roadmap article toward the advent of 10 ps TOF-PET addresses the status and current/future challenges along the development of TOF-PET with the objective to reach this mythic 10 ps frontier that will open the door to real-time volume imaging virtually without tomographic inversion. The medical impact and prospects to achieve this technological revolution from the detection and image reconstruction point-of-views, together with a few perspectives beyond the TOF-PET application are discussed.

TITLE: Quantitative evaluation of unsupervised clustering algorithms for dynamic total-body PET image analysis

AUTHORS: Oona Rainio, Maria K Jaakkola, Riku Klén

JOURNAL: Journal of medical engineering & technology

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Background: Recently, dynamic total-body positron emission tomography (PET) imaging has become possible due to new scanner devices. However, there is still little research systematically evaluating clustering algorithms for processing of dynamic total-body PET images.

Materials and methods: Here, we compare the performance of 15 unsupervised clustering methods, including K-means either by itself or after principal component analysis (PCA) or independent component analysis (ICA), Gaussian mixture model (GMM), fuzzy c-means (FCM), agglomerative clustering, spectral clustering, and several newer clustering algorithms, for classifying time activity curves (TACs) in dynamic PET images. We use dynamic total-body15O-water PET images of 30 patients. To evaluate the clustering algorithms in a quantitative way, we use them to classify 5000 TACs from each image based on whether the curve is taken from brain, right heart ventricle, right kidney, lower right lung lobe, or urinary bladder.

Results: According to our results, the best methods are GMM, FCM, and ICA combined with mini batch K-means, which classified the TACs with a median accuracies of 89%, 83%, and 81%, respectively, in a processing time of half a second or less.

Conclusion: GMM, FCM, and ICA with mini batch K-means show promise for dynamic total-body PET analysis.

TITLE: Cross modality fusion for modality-specific lung tumor segmentation in PET-CT images

AUTHORS: Xu Zhang, Bin Zhang, Shengming Deng, Qingquan Meng, Xinjian Chen, Dehui Xiang

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Although positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) images have been widely used, it is still challenging to accurately segment the lung tumor. The respiration, movement and imaging modality lead to large modality discrepancy of the lung tumors between PET images and CT images. To overcome these difficulties, a novel network is designed to simultaneously obtain the corresponding lung tumors of PET images and CT images. The proposed network can fuse the complementary information and preserve modality-specific features of PET images and CT images. Due to the complementarity between PET images and CT images, the two modality images should be fused for automatic lung tumor segmentation. Therefore, cross modality decoding blocks are designed to extract modality-specific features of PET images and CT images with the constraints of the other modality. The edge consistency loss is also designed to solve the problem of blurred boundaries of PET images and CT images. The proposed method is tested on 126 PET-CT images with non-small cell lung cancer, and Dice similarity coefficient scores of lung tumor segmentation reach 75.66 ± 19.42 in CT images and 79.85 ± 16.76 in PET images, respectively. Extensive comparisons with state-of-the-art lung tumor segmentation methods have also been performed to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed network.

JOURNAL: BMC medical imaging

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
This systematic review aimed to evaluate the potential of deep learning algorithms for converting low-dose Positron Emission Tomography (PET) images to full-dose PET images in different body regions. A total of 55 articles published between 2017 and 2023 by searching PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus and IEEE databases were included in this review, which utilized various deep learning models, such as generative adversarial networks and UNET, to synthesize high-quality PET images.

TITLE: Initial evaluation of a new maximum-likelihood attenuation correction factor-based attenuation correction for time-of-flight brain PET

AUTHORS: Tetsuro Mizuta, Tetsuya Kobayashi, Yoshiyuki Yamakawa, Kohei Hanaoka, Shota Watanabe, Daisuke Morimoto-Ishikawa, Takahiro Yamada, Hayato Kaida, Kazunari Ishii

JOURNAL: Annals of nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Aim: The aim of this study was to evaluate an image reconstruction algorithm, including a new maximum-likelihood attenuation correction factor (ML-ACF) for time of flight (TOF) brain positron emission tomography (PET).

Methods: The implemented algorithm combines an ML-ACF method that simultaneously estimates both the emission image and attenuation sinogram from TOF emission data, and a scaling method based on anatomical features. To evaluate the algorithm's quantitative accuracy, three-dimensional brain phantom images were acquired and soft-tissue attenuation coefficients and emission values were analyzed.

Results: The heterogeneous distributions of attenuation coefficients in soft tissue, skull, and nasal cavity were sufficiently visualized. The attenuation coefficient of soft tissue remained within 5% of theoretical value. Attenuation-corrected emission showed no lateral differences, and significant differences among soft tissue were within the error range.

Conclusion: The ML-ACF-based attenuation correction implemented for TOF brain PET worked well and obtained practical levels of accuracy.

TITLE: Data-driven head motion correction for PET using time-of-flight and positron emission particle tracking techniques

AUTHORS: Tasmia Rahman Tumpa, Shelley N Acuff, Jens Gregor, Yong Bradley, Yitong Fu, Dustin R Osborne

JOURNAL: PloS one

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Objectives: Positron emission tomography (PET) is susceptible to patient movement during a scan. Head motion is a continuing problem for brain PET imaging and diagnostic assessments. Physical head restraints and external motion tracking systems are most commonly used to address to this issue. Data-driven methods offer substantial advantages, such as retroactive processing but typically require manual interaction for robustness. In this work, we introduce a time-of-flight (TOF) weighted positron emission particle tracking (PEPT) algorithm that facilitates fully automated, data-driven head motion detection and subsequent automated correction of the raw listmode data.

Materials methods: We used our previously published TOF-PEPT algorithm Dustin Osborne et al. (2017), Tasmia Rahman Tumpa et al., Tasmia Rahman Tumpa et al. (2021) to automatically identify frames where the patient was near-motionless. The first such static frame was used as a reference to which subsequent static frames were registered. The underlying rigid transformations were estimated using weak radioactive point sources placed on radiolucent glasses worn by the patient. Correction of raw event data were achieved by tracking the point sources in the listmode data which was then repositioned to allow reconstruction of a single image. To create a "gold standard" for comparison purposes, frame-by-frame image registration based correction was implemented. The original listmode data was used to reconstruct an image for each static frame detected by our algorithm and then applying manual landmark registration and external software to merge these into a single image.

Results: We report on five patient studies. The TOF-PEPT algorithm was configured to detect motion using a 500 ms window. Our event-based correction produced images that were visually free of motion artifacts. Comparison of our algorithm to a frame-based image registration approach produced results that were nearly indistinguishable. Quantitatively, Jaccard similarity indices were found to be in the range of 85-98% for the former and 84-98% for the latter when comparing the static frame images with the reference frame counterparts.

Discussion: We have presented a fully automated data-driven method for motion detection and correction of raw listmode data. Easy to implement, the approach achieved high temporal resolution and reliable performance for head motion correction. Our methodology provides a mechanism by which patient motion incurred during imaging can be assessed and corrected post hoc.

TITLE: A novel supervised learning method to generate CT images for attenuation correction in delayed pet scans

AUTHORS: Fan Rao, Bao Yang, Yen-Wei Chen, Jingsong Li, Hongkai Wang, Hongwei Ye, Yaofa Wang, Kui Zhao, Wentao Zhu

JOURNAL: Computer methods and programs in biomedicine

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Background and objectives: Attenuation correction is important for PET image reconstruction. In clinical PET/CT scans, the attenuation information is usually obtained by CT. However, additional CT scans for delayed PET imaging may increase the risk of cancer. In this paper, we propose a novel CT generation method for attenuation correction in delayed PET imaging that requires no additional CT scans.

Methods: As only PET raw data is available for the delayed PET scan, routine image registration methods are difficult to use directly. To solve this problem, a reconstruction network is developed to produce pseudo PET images from raw data first. Then a second network is used to generate the CT image through mapping PET/CT images from the first scan to the delayed scan. The inputs of the second network are the two pseudo PET images from the first and delayed scans, and the CT image from the first scan. The labels are taken from the ground truth CT image in the delayed scan. The loss function contains an image similarity term and a regularization term, which reflect the anatomy matching accuracy and the smoothness of the non-rigid deformation field, respectively.

Results: We evaluated the proposed method with simulated and clinical PET/CT datasets. Standard Uptake Value was computed and compared with the gold standard (with coregistered CT for attenuation correction). The results show that the proposed supervised learning method can generate PET images with high quality and quantitative accuracy. For the test cases in our study, the average MAE and RMSE of the proposed supervised learning method were 4.61 and 22.75 respectively, and the average PSNR between the reconstructed PET image and the ground truth PET image was 62.13 dB.

Conclusions: The proposed method is able to generate accurate CT images for attenuation correction in delayed PET scans. Experiments indicate that the proposed method outperforms traditional methods with respect to quantitative PET image accuracy.

TITLE: DeTransUnet: attenuation correction of gated cardiac images without structural information

AUTHORS: Bo Wang, Lijun Lu, Huafeng Liu

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Objective.Myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) with positron emission tomography (PET) is a non-invasive imaging method, and it is of great significance to the diagnosis and prognosis of coronary heart disease. Attenuation correction (AC) for PET images is a necessary step for further quantitative analysis. In order not to use magnetic resonance (MR) or computed tomography (CT) images for AC, this work proposes DeTransUnet to obtain AC PET images directly from no-attenuation corrected (NAC) PET images.Approach.The proposed DeTransUnet is a 3D structure which combines the multi-scale deformable transformer layers and the 3D convolutional neural network (CNN). And it integrates the advantages of transformer with long-range dependence and CNN suitable for image calculation. The AC images using CT images for AC and scatter correction (SC) and are considered as training labels, while the NAC images are reconstructed without AC and SC. Standard uptake value (SUV) values are calculated for both NAC and AC images to exclude the influence of weight and injection dose. With NAC SUV images as the inputs of the DeTransUnet, the outputs of DeTransUnet are AC SUV images.Main results.The proposed DeTransUnet was performed on an MPI gated-PET dataset, and the results were compared with Unet2D and Unet2.5D. The metrics of the whole image and the left ventricular myocardium show that the proposed method has advantages over other deep learning methods.Significance.The proposed DeTransUnet is a novel AC framework that does not require CT or MR images. It can be used as an independent AC method on PET/MR instrument. In addition, when CT images contain defects or cannot be registered with PET images on PET/CT instrument, DeTransUnet is able to repair the defects and keep consistent with the NAC images.

TITLE: Efficient Delay Correction for Total-Body PET Kinetic Modeling Using Pulse Timing Methods

AUTHORS: Elizabeth J Li, Benjamin A Spencer, Jeffrey P Schmall, Yasser Abdelhafez, Ramsey D Badawi, Guobao Wang, Simon R Cherry

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Quantitative kinetic modeling requires an input function. A noninvasive image-derived input function (IDIF) can be obtained from dynamic PET images. However, a robust IDIF location (e.g., aorta) may be far from a tissue of interest, particularly in total-body PET, introducing a time delay between the IDIF and the tissue. The standard practice of joint estimation (JE) of delay, along with model fitting, is computationally expensive. To improve the efficiency of delay correction for total-body PET parametric imaging, this study investigated the use of pulse timing methods to estimate and correct for delay.Methods:Simulation studies were performed with a range of delay values, frame lengths, and noise levels to test the tolerance of 2 pulse timing methods-leading edge (LE) and constant fraction discrimination and their thresholds. The methods were then applied to data from 21 subjects (14 healthy volunteers, 7 cancer patients) who underwent a 60-min dynamic total-body18F-FDG PET acquisition. Region-of-interest kinetic analysis was performed and parametric images were generated to compare LE and JE methods of delay correction, as well as no delay correction.Results:Simulations demonstrated that a 10% LE threshold resulted in biases and SDs at tolerable levels for all noise levels tested, with 2-s frames. Pooled region-of-interest-based results (n= 154) showed strong agreement between LE (10% threshold) and JE methods in estimating delay (Pearsonr =0.96,P <0.001) and the kinetic parameters(r =0.96,P <0.001),(r =1.00,P <0.001), andK1(r =0.97,P <0.001). When tissues with minimal delay were excluded from pooled analyses, there were reductions in(69.4%) andK1(4.8%) when delay correction was not performed. Similar results were obtained for parametric images; additionally, lesioncontrast was improved overall with LE and JE delay correction compared with no delay correction and Patlak analysis.Conclusion:This study demonstrated the importance of delay correction in total-body PET. LE delay correction can be an efficient surrogate for JE, requiring a fraction of the computational time and allowing for rapid delay correction across more than 106voxels in total-body PET datasets.

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear cardiology : official publication of the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Background: Patient motion constitutes a limitation to15O-water cardiac PET imaging. We examined the ability of image readers to detect and correct patient motion using simulated motion data and clinical patient scans.

Methods: Simulated data consisting of 16 motions applied to 10 motion-free scans were motion corrected using two approaches, pre-analysis and post-analysis for motion identification. Both approaches employed a manual frame-by-frame correction method. In addition, a clinical cohort was analyzed for assessment of prevalence and effect of motion and motion correction.

Results: Motion correction was performed on 94% (pre-analysis) and 64% (post-analysis) of the scans. Large motion artifacts were corrected in 91% (pre-analysis) and 74% (post-analysis) of scans. Artifacts in MBF were reduced in 56% (pre-analysis) and 58% (post-analysis) of the scans. The prevalence of motion in the clinical patient cohort (n = 762) was 10%. Motion correction altered exam interpretation in only 10 (1.3%) clinical patient exams.

Conclusion: Frame-by-frame motion correction after visual inspection is useful in reducing motion artifacts in cardiac15O-water PET. Reviewing the initial results (parametric images and polar maps) as part of the motion correction process, reduced erroneous corrections in motion-free scans. In a large clinical cohort, the impact of motion correction was limited to few patients.

TITLE: FedFTN: Personalized federated learning with deep feature transformation network for multi-institutional low-count PET denoising

AUTHORS: Bo Zhou, Huidong Xie, Qiong Liu, Xiongchao Chen, Xueqi Guo, Zhicheng Feng, Jun Hou, S Kevin Zhou, Biao Li, Axel Rominger, Kuangyu Shi, James S Duncan, Chi Liu

JOURNAL: Medical image analysis

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Low-count PET is an efficient way to reduce radiation exposure and acquisition time, but the reconstructed images often suffer from low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), thus affecting diagnosis and other downstream tasks. Recent advances in deep learning have shown great potential in improving low-count PET image quality, but acquiring a large, centralized, and diverse dataset from multiple institutions for training a robust model is difficult due to privacy and security concerns of patient data. Moreover, low-count PET data at different institutions may have different data distribution, thus requiring personalized models. While previous federated learning (FL) algorithms enable multi-institution collaborative training without the need of aggregating local data, addressing the large domain shift in the application of multi-institutional low-count PET denoising remains a challenge and is still highly under-explored. In this work, we propose FedFTN, a personalized federated learning strategy that addresses these challenges. FedFTN uses a local deep feature transformation network (FTN) to modulate the feature outputs of a globally shared denoising network, enabling personalized low-count PET denoising for each institution. During the federated learning process, only the denoising network's weights are communicated and aggregated, while the FTN remains at the local institutions for feature transformation. We evaluated our method using a large-scale dataset of multi-institutional low-count PET imaging data from three medical centers located across three continents, and showed that FedFTN provides high-quality low-count PET images, outperforming previous baseline FL reconstruction methods across all low-count levels at all three institutions.

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Objective. In-beam positron emission tomography (PET) is a promising technology for real-time monitoring of proton therapy. Random coincidences between prompt radiation events and positron annihilation photon pairs can deteriorate imaging quality during beam-on operation. This study aimed to improve the PET image quality by filtering out the prompt radiation events.Approach. We investigated a prompt radiation event filtering method based on the accelerator radio frequency phase and assessed its performance using various prompt gamma energy thresholds. An in-beam PET prototype was used to acquire the data when the 70 MeV proton beam irradiated a water phantom and a mouse. The signal-to-background ratio (SBR) indicator was utilized to evaluate the quality of the PET reconstruction image.Main results. The selection of the prompt gamma energy threshold will affect the quality of the reconstructed image. Using the optimal energy threshold of 580 keV can obtain a SBR of 1.6 times for the water phantom radiation experiment and 2.0 times for the mouse radiation experiment compared to those without background removal, respectively.Significance. Our results show that using this optimal threshold can reduce the prompt radiation events, enhancing the SBR of the reconstructed image. This advancement contributes to more accurate real-time range verification in subsequent steps.

TITLE: Compartment model-based nonlinear unmixing for kinetic analysis of dynamic PET images

AUTHORS: Yanna Cruz Cavalcanti, Thomas Oberlin, Vinicius Ferraris, Nicolas Dobigeon, Maria Ribeiro, Clovis Tauber

JOURNAL: Medical image analysis

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
When no arterial input function is available, quantification of dynamic PET images requires a previous step devoted to the extraction of a reference time-activity curve (TAC). Factor analysis is often applied for this purpose. This paper introduces a novel approach that conducts a new kind of nonlinear factor analysis relying on a compartment model, and computes the kinetic parameters of specific binding tissues jointly. To this end, it capitalizes on data-driven parametric imaging methods to provide a physical description of the underlying PET data, directly relating the specific binding with the kinetics of the non-specific binding in the corresponding tissues. This characterization is introduced into the factor analysis formulation to yield a novel nonlinear unmixing model designed for PET image analysis. This model also explicitly introduces global kinetic parameters that allow for a direct estimation of a binding potential that represents the ratio at equilibrium of specifically bound radioligand to the concentration of nondisplaceable radioligand in each non-specific binding tissue. The performance of the method is evaluated on synthetic and real data to demonstrate its potential interest.

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: To provide a holistic and complete comparison of the five most advanced AI models in the augmentation of low-dose18F-FDG PET data over the entire dose reduction spectrum.

Methods: In this multicenter study, five AI models were investigated for restoring low-count whole-body PET/MRI, covering convolutional benchmarks - U-Net, enhanced deep super-resolution network (EDSR), generative adversarial network (GAN) - and the most cutting-edge image reconstruction transformer models in computer vision to date - Swin transformer image restoration network (SwinIR) and EDSR-ViT (vision transformer). The models were evaluated against six groups of count levels representing the simulated 75%, 50%, 25%, 12.5%, 6.25%, and 1% (extremely ultra-low-count) of the clinical standard 3 MBq/kg18F-FDG dose. The comparisons were performed upon two independent cohorts - (1) a primary cohort from Stanford University and (2) a cross-continental external validation cohort from Tübingen University - in order to ensure the findings are generalizable. A total of 476 original count and simulated low-count whole-body PET/MRI scans were incorporated into this analysis.

Results: For low-count PET restoration on the primary cohort, the mean structural similarity index (SSIM) scores for dose 6.25% were 0.898 (95% CI, 0.887-0.910) for EDSR, 0.893 (0.881-0.905) for EDSR-ViT, 0.873 (0.859-0.887) for GAN, 0.885 (0.873-0.898) for U-Net, and 0.910 (0.900-0.920) for SwinIR. In continuation, SwinIR and U-Net's performances were also discreetly evaluated at each simulated radiotracer dose levels. Using the primary Stanford cohort, the mean diagnostic image quality (DIQ; 5-point Likert scale) scores of SwinIR restoration were 5 (SD, 0) for dose 75%, 4.50 (0.535) for dose 50%, 3.75 (0.463) for dose 25%, 3.25 (0.463) for dose 12.5%, 4 (0.926) for dose 6.25%, and 2.5 (0.534) for dose 1%.

Conclusion: Compared to low-count PET images, with near-to or nondiagnostic images at higher dose reduction levels (up to 6.25%), both SwinIR and U-Net significantly improve the diagnostic quality of PET images. A radiotracer dose reduction to 1% of the current clinical standard radiotracer dose is out of scope for current AI techniques.

TITLE: A hybrid predictor-corrector network and spatiotemporal classifier method for noisy plant PET image classification

AUTHORS: Weike Chang, Nicola D'Ascenzo, Emanuele Antonecchia, Daniele Passaretti, Giancarlo Pagnani, Michele Pisante, Qingguo Xie

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Objective. Plant Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a new and efficient imaging technique which aims at providing a quantitative analysis of plant stress, enabling personalized crop management and maximizing productivity. However, a highly performant classification system for noisy dynamic plant PET images faces the challenge of retrieving noise-free datasets and encoding both spatial and temporal representations within a unified model.Approach. To overcome these limitations, we introduce an innovative hybrid model that combines denoising and classification for dynamic plant PET images. Initially, we compute a precise solution for the denoising problem of noisy dynamic plant PET images using a modified optimization method coupled with deep convolutional neural networks. Subsequently, this solution is unfolded into a deep network known as the predictor-corrector network (PCNet). To optimize the PCNet without requiring a noise-free dynamic training set, we propose a novel unsupervised learning method. Finally, the sequence of noise-reduced dynamic plant PET images is further fed into a unique classification system, encoding spatial representations of images and temporal representations of multivariate time series into a unified spatiotemporal representation and generating a prediction.Main results. The experimental results underscore the necessity of the denoising procedure and highlight the superiority of the proposed PCNet over existing competing denoising methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed classification system. Notably, the classification performance between the two classes achieves an averaged accuracy of 0.852, an averaged precision of 0.838, an averaged recall of 0.959, and an averaged F1-score of 0.880.Significance. The ability of the proposed method to reduce noise intensity and effectively encode spatiotemporal representations overcomes the limitations of existing methods. This advancement may have substantial implications for other noisy dynamic image classification.

TITLE: [Influence of Reconstruction FOV and Matrix Size on the Quantitative Accuracy of FDG-PET: Comparison between OSEM and Bayesian Penalized Likelihood]

AUTHORS: Shinya Mikami, Fumitoshi Nakamura, Akihiro Nakamura, Tatsuo Torizuka

JOURNAL: Nihon Hoshasen Gijutsu Gakkai zasshi

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Field of view (FOV) and matrix size determine the pixel size of positron emission tomography (PET) images; however, the effect of any variation in these parameters on the quantitative accuracy is unclear. The FOV and matrix size of PET images are adjusted as per each clinical objective. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the quantitative accuracy of PET images under different FOV and matrix sizes.

Method: A National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) body phantom set was filled with18F-FDG solution, and imaging data were acquired for 30 min. Images were reconstructed using ordered subset expectation maximization (OSEM) and Bayesian penalized likelihood (BPL), both of which were combined with point spread function (PSF) and time of flight (TOF). In each reconstruction method, the image parameters were set to the following: FOV, 20-70 cm; matrix size, 128×128 to 384×384; and pixel size, 1-3 mm. The images were evaluated by physical assessment of the recovery coefficient (RC) and maximum standardized uptake value ratio (SUVmax ratio).

Result: The RC of OSEM images was not affected by changes in FOV, whereas the RC of BPL images decreased in small spheres, when FOV was 20 and 30 cm. The SUVmax ratioof the OSEM images was not affected by the difference in pixel size. However, the SUVmax ratioof BPL images degraded in the 1-mm pixel size; this influence was observed only when the FOV was changed. Conclusion: BPL images reconstructed using a small FOV might degrade the quantitative accuracy of small spheres.

JOURNAL: Applied radiation and isotopes : including data, instrumentation and methods for use in agriculture, industry and medicine

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
The general-purpose particle transport code, FLUKA, was used to model the GE Advance Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scanner (GEMS). The required spatial and energy data were extracted using the FLUKA phase-space card, USERDUMP, with its user-routine, mgdraw, consisting of full-events information. Several point and volumetric sources were modeled and the corresponding locations of the sources were identified using three different proposed algorithms which eliminate the use of conventional image-reconstruction packages. Also, having extracted the time information, the time-of-flight approach in PET (TOF-PET) was used to reconstruct the images of several volumetric positron-emitting sources, representing the best results according to the chi-square analysis data. The post-processing calculations, both on CPU and GPU, were undertaken either with MATLAB or Fortran programming.

TITLE: Development of a digital zebrafish phantom and its application to dedicated small-fish PET

AUTHORS: M Zvolský, M Schaar, S Seeger, S Rakers, M Rafecas

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Objective. We are developing a small-fish positron emission tomography (PET) scanner dedicated to small aquatic animals relevant for biomedical and biological research, e.g. zebrafish. We plan to use Monte Carlo simulations to optimize its configuration and the required water-filled imaging chambers. Our objectives were: (1) to create a digital 3D zebrafish phantom using conventional micro-CT, (2) include the phantom into a simulated PET environment based on the framework GATE, and (3) investigate the effects of the water environment on the reconstructed images.Approach. To create the phantom, we performedex vivomeasurements of zebrafish specimen using a tabletop micro-CT and compared three methods to fixate the specimen. From segmented micro-CT images we created digital emission and transmission phantoms which were incorporated in GATE via tessellated volumes. Two chamber sizes were considered. For reference, a simulation with the zebrafish in air was implemented. The simulated data were reconstructed using CASToR. For attenuation correction, we used the exact attenuation information or a uniform distribution (only water). Several realizations of each scenario were performed; the reconstructed images were quantitatively evaluated.Main results. Fixation in formalin led to the best soft-tissue contrast at the cost of some specimen deformation. After attenuation correction, no significant differences were found between the reconstructed images. The PET images reflected well the higher uptake simulated in the brain and heart, despite their small size and surrounding background activity; the swim bladder (no activity) was clearly identified. The simplified attenuation map, consisting only of water, slightly worsened the images.Significance. A conventional micro-CT can provide sufficient image quality to generate numerical phantoms of small fish without contrast media. Such phantoms are useful to evaluate in-silico small aquatic animal imaging concepts and develop imaging protocols. Our results support the feasibility of zebrafish PET with an aqueous environment.

TITLE: High Temporal Resolution Total-Body Dynamic PET Imaging Based on Pixel-Level Time-Activity Curve Correction

AUTHORS: Zixiang Chen, Yaping Wu, Na Zhang, Tao Sun, Yu Shen, Hairong Zheng, Dong Liang, Meiyun Wang, Zhanli Hu

JOURNAL: IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Dynamic positron emission tomography (dPET) is currently a widely used medical imaging technique for the clinical diagnosis, staging and therapy guidance of all kinds of human cancers. Higher temporal imaging resolution for the early stage of radiotracer metabolism is desired; however, in this case, the reconstructed images with short frame durations always suffer from a limited image signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and unsatisfactory image spatial resolution. The appearance of uEXPLORER (United Imaging Healthcare, Inc.) with higher PET imaging sensitivity and resolution may help solving this problem. In this work, based on dynamic PET data acquired by uEXPLORER, we proposed a dPET processing method that denoises images with short frame durations via pixel-level time-activity curve (TAC) correction based on third-order Hermite interpolation (Pitch-In). The proposed method was validated and compared to several state-of-the-art methods to demonstrate its superior performance in terms of high temporal resolution dPET image noise reduction and imaging accuracy. Higher stability and feasibility of the proposed Pitch-In method for future clinical application with high temporal resolution (HTR) dPET imaging can be expected.

TITLE: A Novel J-Shape Antenna Array for Simultaneous MR-PET or MR-SPECT Imaging

AUTHORS: Chang-Hoon Choi, Suk-Min Hong, Jorg Felder, Lutz Tellmann, Jurgen Scheins, Elena Rota Kops, Christoph Lerche, N Jon Shah

JOURNAL: IEEE transactions on medical imaging

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Simultaneous MR-PET/-SPECT is an emerging technology that capitalises on the invaluable advantages of both modalities, allowing access to numerous sensitive tracers and superior soft-tissue contrast alongside versatile functional imaging capabilities. However, to optimise these capabilities, concurrent acquisitions require the MRI antenna located inside the PET/SPECT field-of-view to be operated without compromising any aspects of system performance or image quality compared to the stand-alone instrumentation. Here, we report a novel gamma-radiation-transparent antenna concept. The end-fed J-shape antenna is particularly adept for hybrid ultra-high field MR-PET/-SPECT applications as it enables all highly attenuating materials to be placed outside the imaging field-of-view. Furthermore, this unique configuration also provides advantages in stand-alone MR applications by reducing the amount of coupling between the cables and the antenna elements, and by lowering the potential specific absorption rate burden. The use of this new design was experimentally verified according to the important features for both ultra-high field MRI and the 511 keV transmission scan. The reconstructed attenuation maps evidently showed much lower attenuation ( ∼ 15 %) for the proposed array when compared to the conventional dipole antenna array since there were no high-density components. In MR, it was observed that the signal-to-noise ratio from the whole volume obtained using the proposed array was comparable to that acquired by the conventional array which was also in agreement with the simulation results. The unique feature, J-shape array, would enable simultaneous MR-PET/-SPECT experiments to be conducted without unduly compromising any aspects of system performance and image quality compared to the stand-alone instrumentation.

TITLE: Joint estimation of activity, attenuation and motion in respiratory-self-gated time-of-flight PET

AUTHORS: Masoud Elhamiasl, Frederic Jolivet, Ahmadreza Rezaei, Michael Fieseler, Klaus Schäfers, Johan Nuyts, Georg Schramm, Fernando Boada

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Objective. Whole-body positron emission tomography (PET) imaging is often hindered by respiratory motion during acquisition, causing significant degradation in the quality of reconstructed activity images. An additional challenge in PET/CT imaging arises from the respiratory phase mismatch between CT-based attenuation correction and PET acquisition, leading to attenuation artifacts. To address these issues, we propose two new, purely data-driven methods for the joint estimation of activity, attenuation, and motion in respiratory self-gated time-of-flight PET. These methods enable the reconstruction of a single activity image free from motion and attenuation artifacts.Approach. The proposed methods were evaluated using data from the anthropomorphic Wilhelm phantom acquired on a Siemens mCT PET/CT system, as well as three clinical [18F]FDG PET/CT datasets acquired on a GE DMI PET/CT system. Image quality was assessed visually to identify motion and attenuation artifacts. Lesion uptake values were quantitatively compared across reconstructions without motion modeling, with motion modeling but 'static' attenuation correction, and with our proposed methods.Main results. For the Wilhelm phantom, the proposed methods delivered image quality closely matching the reference reconstruction from a static acquisition. The lesion-to-background contrast for a liver dome lesion improved from 2.0 (no motion correction) to 5.2 (using our proposed methods), matching the contrast from the static acquisition (5.2). In contrast, motion modeling with 'static' attenuation correction yielded a lower contrast of 3.5. In patient datasets, the proposed methods successfully reduced motion artifacts in lung and liver lesions and mitigated attenuation artifacts, demonstrating superior lesion to background separation.Significance. Our proposed methods enable the reconstruction of a single, high-quality activity image that is motion-corrected and free from attenuation artifacts, without the need for external hardware.

JOURNAL: Physica medica : PM : an international journal devoted to the applications of physics to medicine and biology : official journal of the Italian Association of Biomedical Physics (AIFB)

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: The study proposes the use of three-dimensional CdZnTe Compton camera (3D-CZT CC) for radiopharmaceutical imaging and investigates the influence factors using a 3D-printed mouse phantom.

Methods: The event selection method and image reconstruction algorithm are optimized by Monte Carlo simulations and mouse phantom experiments.

Results: Simulation results show that the intrinsic energy resolution and spatial resolution of 3D-CZT cause a certain deviation in the calculated Compton scattering angle and Compton axis. Such deviation causes the imaging quality to deteriorate. By selecting events whose distance between Compton and photoelectronic interactions are larger than 10 mm, the mean deviation of the Compton axis could be reduced to less than 10%. Using the ordered origin ensemble algorithm with resolution recovery, the artifacts around organs where the radiopharmaceutical was placed are reduced, and the quality of the reconstruction results are improved compared to the results with simple back projection and origin ensembles algorithms. The phantom study shows that the 3D-CZT CC imaging device could visualize the radiopharmaceuticals distribution by 15 min detection.

Conclusions: Through the analysis of this study, the feasibility of 3D-CZT CC for in-vivo distribution measurement of radiopharmaceuticals is demonstrated, and the quality of reconstruction result has been improved.

TITLE: Obtaining PET/CT images from non-attenuation corrected PET images in a single PET system using Wasserstein generative adversarial networks

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging plays an indispensable role in early disease detection and postoperative patient staging diagnosis. However, PET imaging requires not only additional computed tomography (CT) imaging to provide detailed anatomical information but also attenuation correction (AC) maps calculated from CT images for precise PET quantification, which inevitably demands that patients undergo additional doses of ionizing radiation. To reduce the radiation dose and simultaneously obtain high-quality PET/CT images, in this work, we present an alternative based on deep learning that can estimate synthetic attenuation corrected PET (sAC PET) and synthetic CT (sCT) images from non-attenuation corrected PET (NAC PET) scans for whole-body PET/CT imaging. Our model consists of two stages: the first stage removes noise and artefacts in the NAC PET images to generate sAC PET images, and the second stage synthesizes CT images from the sAC PET images obtained in the first stage. Both stages employ the same deep Wasserstein generative adversarial network and identical loss functions, which encourage the proposed model to generate more realistic and satisfying output images. To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, we conducted a comprehensive study on a total of 45 sets of paired PET/CT images of clinical patients. The final experimental results demonstrated that both the generated sAC PET and sCT images showed great similarity to true AC PET and true CT images based on both qualitative and quantitative analyses. These results also indicate that in the future, our proposed algorithm has tremendous potential for reducing the need for additional anatomic imaging in hybrid PET/CT systems or the need for lengthy MR sequence acquisition in hybrid PET/MRI systems.

TITLE: Transfer learning for data-efficient abdominal muscle segmentation with convolutional neural networks

AUTHORS: Dónal M McSweeney, Edward G Henderson, Marcel van Herk, Jamie Weaver, Paul A Bromiley, Andrew Green, Alan McWilliam

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Background: Skeletal muscle segmentation is an important procedure for assessing sarcopenia, an emerging imaging biomarker of patient frailty. Data annotation remains the bottleneck for training deep learning auto-segmentation models.

Purpose: There is a need to define methodologies for applying models to different domains (e.g., anatomical regions or imaging modalities) without dramatically increasing data annotation.

Methods: To address this problem, we empirically evaluate the generalizability of various source tasks for transfer learning: natural image classification, natural image segmentation, unsupervised image reconstruction, and self-supervised jigsaw solving. Axial CT slices at L3 were extracted from PET-CT scans for 204 oesophago-gastric cancer patients and the skeletal muscle manually delineated by an expert. Features were transferred and segmentation models trained on subsets () of the manually annotated training set. Four-fold cross-validation was performed to evaluate model generalizability. Human-level performance was established by performing an inter-observer study consisting of ten trained radiographers.

Results: We find that accurate segmentation models can be trained on a fraction of the data required by current approaches. The Dice similarity coefficient and root mean square distance-to-agreement were calculated for each prediction and used to assess model performance. Models pre-trained on a segmentation task and fine-tuned on 10 images produce delineations that are comparable to those from trained observers and extract reliable measures of muscle health.

Conclusions: Appropriate transfer learning can generate convolutional neural networks for abdominal muscle segmentation that achieve human-level performance while decreasing the required data by an order of magnitude, compared to previous methods (). This work enables the development of future models for assessing skeletal muscle at other anatomical sites where large annotated data sets are scarce and clinical needs are yet to be addressed.

TITLE: Visualization of small brain nuclei with a high-spatial resolution, clinically available whole-body PET scanner

AUTHORS: Yuki Shinohara, Masanobu Ibaraki, Keisuke Matsubara, Kaoru Sato, Hiroyuki Yamamoto, Toshibumi Kinoshita

JOURNAL: Annals of nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Objective: To verify the visibility of physiological18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) uptake in nuclei in and around the brainstem by a whole-body (WB) silicon photomultiplier positron emission tomography (SiPM-PET) scanner with point-spread function (PSF) reconstruction using various iteration numbers.

Methods: Ten healthy subjects (5 men, 5 women; mean age, 56.0 ± 5.0 years) who underwent18F-FDG PET/CT using a WB SiPM-PET scanner and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain including a spin-echo three-dimensional sampling perfection with application-optimized contrasts using different flip angle evolutions fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (3D-FLAIR) and a 3D-T1 magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo (T1-MPRAGE) images were enrolled. Each acquired PET image was reconstructed using ordered-subset expectation maximization (OSEM) with iteration numbers of 4, 16, 64, and 256 (subset 5 fixed) + time-of-flight (TOF) + PSF. The reconstructed PET images and 3D-FLAIR images for each subject were registered to individual T1-MPRAGE volumes using normalized mutual information criteria. For each MR-coregistered individual PET image, the pattern of FDG uptake in the inferior olivary nuclei (ION), dentate nuclei (DN), midbrain raphe nuclei (MRN), inferior colliculi (IC), mammillary bodies (MB), red nuclei (RN), subthalamic nuclei (STN), lateral geniculate nuclei (LGN), medial geniculate nuclei (MGN), and superior colliculi (SC) was visually classified into the following three categories: good, clearly distinguishable FDG accumulation; fair, obscure contour of FDG accumulation; poor, FDG accumulation indistinguishable from surrounding uptake.

Results: Among individual18F-FDG PET images with OSEM iterations of 4, 16, 64, and 256 + TOF + PSF, the iteration numbers that showed the best visibility in each structure were as follows: ION, MRN, LGN, MGN, and SC, iteration 64; DN, iteration 16; IC, iterations 16, 64, and 256; MB, iterations 64 and 256; and RN and STN, iterations 16 and 64, respectively. Of the four iterations, the18F-FDG PET image of iteration 64 visualized FDG accumulation in small structures in and around the brainstem most clearly (good, 98 structures; fair, 2 structures).

Conclusions: A clinically available WB SiPM-PET scanner is useful for visualizing physiological FDG uptake in small brain nuclei, using a sufficiently high number of iterations for OSEM with TOF and PSF reconstructions.

ABSTRACT:
PET with18F-FDG has been increasingly applied, predominantly in the research setting, to study drug effects and pulmonary biology and to monitor disease progression and treatment outcomes in lung diseases that interfere with gas exchange through alterations of the pulmonary parenchyma, airways, or vasculature. To date, however, there are no widely accepted standard acquisition protocols or imaging data analysis methods for pulmonary18F-FDG PET/CT in these diseases, resulting in disparate approaches. Hence, comparison of data across the literature is challenging. To help harmonize the acquisition and analysis and promote reproducibility, we collated details of acquisition protocols and analysis methods from 7 PET centers. From this information and our discussions, we reached the consensus recommendations given here on patient preparation, choice of dynamic versus static imaging, image reconstruction, and image analysis reporting.

TITLE: Challenges and limitations in applying radiomics to PET imaging: Possible opportunities and avenues for research

AUTHORS: Alessandro Stefano

JOURNAL: Computers in biology and medicine

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Radiomics, the high-throughput extraction of quantitative imaging features from medical images, holds immense potential for advancing precision medicine in oncology and beyond. While radiomics applied to positron emission tomography (PET) imaging offers unique insights into tumor biology and treatment response, it is imperative to elucidate the challenges and constraints inherent in this domain to facilitate their translation into clinical practice. This review examines the challenges and limitations of applying radiomics to PET imaging, synthesizing findings from the last five years (2019-2023) and highlights the significance of addressing these challenges to realize the full clinical potential of radiomics in oncology and molecular imaging. A comprehensive search was conducted across multiple electronic databases, including PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science, using keywords relevant to radiomics issues in PET imaging. Only studies published in peer-reviewed journals were eligible for inclusion in this review. Although many studies have highlighted the potential of radiomics in predicting treatment response, assessing tumor heterogeneity, enabling risk stratification, and personalized therapy selection, various challenges regarding the practical implementation of the proposed models still need to be addressed. This review illustrates the challenges and limitations of radiomics in PET imaging across various cancer types, encompassing both phantom and clinical investigations. The analyzed studies highlight the importance of reproducible segmentation methods, standardized pre-processing and post-processing methodologies, and the need to create large multicenter studies registered in a centralized database to promote the continuous validation and clinical integration of radiomics into PET imaging.

JOURNAL: European radiology

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Objectives: To introduce an automated computational algorithm that estimates the global noise level across the whole imaging volume of PET datasets.

Methods: [18F]FDG PET images of 38 patients were reconstructed with simulated decreasing acquisition times (15-120 s) resulting in increasing noise levels, and with block sequential regularized expectation maximization with beta values of 450 and 600 (Q.Clear 450 and 600). One reader performed manual volume-of-interest (VOI) based noise measurements in liver and lung parenchyma and two readers graded subjective image quality as sufficient or insufficient. An automated computational noise measurement algorithm was developed and deployed on the whole imaging volume of each reconstruction, delivering a single value representing the global image noise (Global Noise Index, GNI). Manual noise measurement values and subjective image quality gradings were compared with the GNI.

Results: Irrespective of the absolute noise values, there was no significant difference between the GNI and manual liver measurements in terms of the distribution of noise values (p = 0.84 for Q.Clear 450, and p = 0.51 for Q.Clear 600). The GNI showed a fair to moderately strong correlation with manual noise measurements in liver parenchyma (r = 0.6 in Q.Clear 450, r = 0.54 in Q.Clear 600, all p < 0.001), and a fair correlation with manual noise measurements in lung parenchyma (r = 0.52 in Q.Clear 450, r = 0.33 in Q.Clear 600, all p < 0.001). Classification performance of the GNI for subjective image quality was AUC 0.898 for Q.Clear 450 and 0.919 for Q.Clear 600.

Conclusion: An algorithm provides an accurate and meaningful estimation of the global noise level encountered in clinical PET imaging datasets.

Clinical relevance statement: An automated computational approach that measures the global noise level of PET imaging datasets may facilitate quality standardization and benchmarking of clinical PET imaging within and across institutions.

Key points: • Noise is an important quantitative marker that strongly impacts image quality of PET images. • An automated computational noise measurement algorithm provides an accurate and meaningful estimation of the global noise level encountered in clinical PET imaging datasets. • An automated computational approach that measures the global noise level of PET imaging datasets may facilitate quality standardization and benchmarking as well as protocol harmonization.

TITLE: Technical note: Can photon-counting CT improve PET/CT's quantitative accuracy?

AUTHORS: James Hamill, Noah Birge, Jim O'Doherty, Jonathon Nye, Saeed Elojeimy

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Background: Linear attenuation coefficients (LACs) in positron emission tomography combined with computed tomography (PET/CT) are derived from CT scans that utilize energy-integrating detectors (EID-CT). These LACs are inaccurate when iodine contrast has been injected. Photon counting detector CT (PCD-CT) may be able to improve the accuracy.

Purpose: To investigate whether PCD-CT can improve PET/CT quantitative accuracy.

Methods: Two experiments were performed: one with CT only and one that combined PET and CT. The first experiment used an electron density phantom whose inserts were imaged with EID-CT and PCD-CT. The inserts simulated normal human tissues, including bone and iodinated blood. In the case of PCD-CT, virtual-monoenergetic images at 190 keV were created. LACs were derived in each case and compared against known values. For inserts with iodine, more accurate LACs were expected with PCD-CT. The second experiment involved a custom PET phantom with various materials simulating human tissues (blood, iodinated blood, and bone) and18F radioactivity. Data were first acquired with an EID-CT-based PET/CT system and then separately in a PCD-CT system without PET. PET images were reconstructed using LAC from EID-CT and PCD-CT. PET image values were compared against known activity values using recovery coefficients (RC).

Results: In the first experiment, LAC based on EID-CT were in error by as much as 18%, whereas the corresponding PCD-CT based measurements were within 3%. In the second experiment, minimum, maximum, and mean RC were (96.1%, 115.4%, and 103.8%) for the EID-CT method, and (95.8%, 105.5%, and 101.0%) for the PCD-CT method. The consistency of PET images in body and head orientations was improved.

Conclusions: PCD-CT can acquire the information needed for accurate LAC for PET reconstruction in a single spiral acquisition.

ABSTRACT:
Background: We compared silicone photomultipliers with digital photon counting (SiPM) and photomultiplier tubes (PMT) positron emission tomography (PET) in imaging coronary plaque activity with18F-sodium fluoride (18F-NaF) and evaluated comprehensively SiPM PET reconstruction settings.

Methods: In 25 cardiovascular disease patients (mean age 67 ± 12 years), we conducted18F-NaF PET on a SiPM (Biograph Vision) and conventional PET (Discovery 710) on the same day as part of a prospective clinical trial (NCT03689946). Following administration of 250 MBq of18F-NaF, patients underwent a contrast-enhanced CT angiography and a 30-min PET acquisition in list-mode on each PET consecutively. Image noise was defined as mean standard deviation of blood pool activity within the left atria. Target-to-background ratio (TBR) and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) were measured within the whole-vessel tubular three-dimensional volumes of interest on the cardiac motion and attenuation-corrected18F-NaF PET images using dedicated software.

Results: There were significant differences in image noise and background activity between the two PETs (Image noise (%), PMT: 7.6 ± 3.7 vs SiPM: 4.0 ± 2.3, P < 0.001; background activity, PMT: 1.4 ± 0.4 vs SiPM: 1.0 ± 0.3, P < 0.001). Similarly, the SNR and TBR were significantly higher in vessels scanned with the SiPM PET (SNR, PMT: 16.3 ± 11.5 vs SiPM: 32.7 ± 29.8, P < 0.001; TBR, PMT: 0.8 ± 0.4 vs SiPM: 1.1 ± 0.6, P < 0.001). SiPM PET image reconstruction with a 256 matrix, 1.4 mm pixel, and 2 mm Gaussian filter provided best trade off in terms of maximal SNR, TBR, and clinically practical file size.

Conclusions: In18F-NaF coronary PET imaging, the SiPM PET showed superior image contrast and less image noise compared with PMT PET.

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: To evaluate whether the Centiloid Scale may be used to diagnose Alzheimer's Disease (AD) pathology effectively with the only use of amyloid PET imaging modality from a brain-dedicated PET scanner.

Methods: This study included 26 patients with amyloid PET images with 3 different radiotracers. All patients were acquired both on a PET/CT and a brain-dedicated PET scanner (CareMiBrain, CMB), from which 4 different reconstructions were implemented. A new pipeline was proposed and used for the PET image analysis based on the original Centiloid Scale processing pipeline, but with only PET images. The Youden's Index was employed to calculate the optimal cutoffs for diagnosis and evaluated by the AUC, accuracy, precision, and recall metrics.

Results: The Centiloid Scale (CL) processing pipeline was validated with and without the use of MR images. The CL cutoffs for AD pathology diagnosis on the PET/CT and the 4 CMB reconstructions were 34.4 ± 2.2, 43.5 ± 3.5, 51.9 ± 12.5, 57.5 ± 6.8 and 41.8 ± 1.2 respectively. Overall, for these cutoffs all metrics obtained the maximum score.

Conclusion: The Centiloid scale applied to PET images allows for AD pathology diagnosis. The CMB scanner can be used with the Centiloid scale to automatically assist in the diagnosis of AD pathology, relieving the large burden of neurodegenerative diseases on a traditional PET/CT.

TITLE: The use of hyperpolarised 13C-MRI in clinical body imaging to probe cancer metabolism

AUTHORS: Ramona Woitek, Ferdia A Gallagher

JOURNAL: British journal of cancer

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Metabolic reprogramming is one of the hallmarks of cancer and includes the Warburg effect, which is exhibited by many tumours. This can be exploited by positron emission tomography (PET) as part of routine clinical cancer imaging. However, an emerging and alternative method to detect altered metabolism is carbon-13 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) following injection of hyperpolarised [1-13C]pyruvate. The technique increases the signal-to-noise ratio for the detection of hyperpolarised13C-labelled metabolites by several orders of magnitude and facilitates the dynamic, noninvasive imaging of the exchange of13C-pyruvate to13C-lactate over time. The method has produced promising preclinical results in the area of oncology and is currently being explored in human imaging studies. The first translational studies have demonstrated the safety and feasibility of the technique in patients with prostate, renal, breast and pancreatic cancer, as well as revealing a successful response to treatment in breast and prostate cancer patients at an earlier stage than multiparametric MRI. This review will focus on the strengths of the technique and its applications in the area of oncological body MRI including noninvasive characterisation of disease aggressiveness, mapping of tumour heterogeneity, and early response assessment. A comparison of hyperpolarised13C-MRI with state-of-the-art multiparametric MRI is likely to reveal the unique additional information and applications offered by the technique.

TITLE: Employing Multiple Low-Dose PET Images (at Different Dose Levels) as Prior Knowledge to Predict Standard-Dose PET Images

AUTHORS: Behnoush Sanaei, Reza Faghihi, Hossein Arabi

JOURNAL: Journal of digital imaging

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
The existing deep learning-based denoising methods predicting standard-dose PET images (S-PET) from the low-dose versions (L-PET) solely rely on a single-dose level of PET images as the input of deep learning network. In this work, we exploited the prior knowledge in the form of multiple low-dose levels of PET images to estimate the S-PET images. To this end, a high-resolution ResNet architecture was utilized to predict S-PET images from 6 to 4% L-PET images. For the 6% L-PET imaging, two models were developed; the first and second models were trained using a single input of 6% L-PET and three inputs of 6%, 4%, and 2% L-PET as input to predict S-PET images, respectively. Similarly, for 4% L-PET imaging, a model was trained using a single input of 4% low-dose data, and a three-channel model was developed getting 4%, 3%, and 2% L-PET images. The performance of the four models was evaluated using structural similarity index (SSI), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), and root mean square error (RMSE) within the entire head regions and malignant lesions. The 4% multi-input model led to improved SSI and PSNR and a significant decrease in RMSE by 22.22% and 25.42% within the entire head region and malignant lesions, respectively. Furthermore, the 4% multi-input network remarkably decreased the lesions' SUVmeanbias and SUVmaxbias by 64.58% and 37.12% comparing to single-input network. In addition, the 6% multi-input network decreased the RMSE within the entire head region, within the lesions, lesions' SUVmeanbias, and SUVmaxbias by 37.5%, 39.58%, 86.99%, and 45.60%, respectively. This study demonstrated the significant benefits of using prior knowledge in the form of multiple L-PET images to predict S-PET images.

TITLE: A CT-less approach to quantitative PET imaging using the LSO intrinsic radiation for long-axial FOV PET scanners

AUTHORS: Mohammadreza Teimoorisichani, Vladimir Panin, Harold Rothfuss, Hasan Sari, Axel Rominger, Maurizio Conti

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Long-axial field-of-view (FOV) positron emission tomography (PET) scanners have gained a lot of interest in the recent years. Such scanners provide increased sensitivity and enable unique imaging opportunities that were not previously feasible. Benefiting from the high sensitivity of a long-axial FOV PET scanner, we studied a computed tomography (CT)-less reconstruction algorithm for the Siemens Biograph Vision Quadra with an axial FOV of 106 cm.

Methods: In this work, the background radiation from radioisotope lutetium-176 in the scintillators was used to create an initial estimate of the attenuation maps. Then, joint activity and attenuation reconstruction algorithms were used to create an improved attenuation map of the object. The final attenuation maps were then used to reconstruct quantitative PET images, which were compared against CT-based PET images. The proposed method was evaluated on data from three patients who underwent a flurodeoxyglucouse PET scan.

Results: Segmentation of the PET images of the three studied patients showed an average quantitative error of 6.5%-8.3% across all studied organs when using attenuation maps from maximum likelihood estimation of attenuation and activity and 5.3%-6.6% when using attenuation maps from maximum likelihood estimation of activity and attenuation correction coefficients.

Conclusions: Benefiting from the background radiation of lutetium-based scintillators, a quantitative CT-less PET imaging technique was evaluated in this work.

TITLE: Optimizing the frame duration for data-driven rigid motion estimation in brain PET imaging

AUTHORS: Matthew G Spangler-Bickell, Samuel A Hurley, Timothy W Deller, Floris Jansen, Valentino Bettinardi, Mackenzie Carlson, Michael Zeineh, Greg Zaharchuk, Alan B McMillan

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Data-driven rigid motion estimation for PET brain imaging is usually performed using data frames sampled at low temporal resolution to reduce the overall computation time and to provide adequate signal-to-noise ratio in the frames. In recent work it has been demonstrated that list-mode reconstructions of ultrashort frames are sufficient for motion estimation and can be performed very quickly. In this work we take the approach of using image-based registration of reconstructions of very short frames for data-driven motion estimation, and optimize a number of reconstruction and registration parameters (frame duration, MLEM iterations, image pixel size, post-smoothing filter, reference image creation, and registration metric) to ensure accurate registrations while maximizing temporal resolution and minimizing total computation time.

Methods: Data from18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and18F-florbetaben (FBB) tracer studies with varying count rates are analyzed, for PET/MR and PET/CT scanners. For framed reconstructions using various parameter combinations interframe motion is simulated and image-based registrations are performed to estimate that motion.

Results: For FDG and FBB tracers using 4 × 105true and scattered coincidence events per frame ensures that 95% of the registrations will be accurate to within 1 mm of the ground truth. This corresponds to a frame duration of 0.5-1 sec for typical clinical PET activity levels. Using four MLEM iterations with no subsets, a transaxial pixel size of 4 mm, a post-smoothing filter with 4-6 mm full width at half maximum, and averaging two or more frames to create the reference image provides an optimal set of parameters to produce accurate registrations while keeping the reconstruction and processing time low.

Conclusions: It is shown that very short frames (≤1 sec) can be used to provide accurate and quick data-driven rigid motion estimates for use in an event-by-event motion corrected reconstruction.

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Background: The aim of this phantom study was to optimize the [68Ga]Ga-PSMA PET/CT examination in terms of scan time duration and image reconstruction parameters, in combination with PSF and TOF modelling, in a digital Biograph Vision PET/CT scanner.

Methods: Three types of phantoms were used: 1) soft-tissue tumor phantom consisting of six spheres mounted in a torso phantom; 2) bone-lung tumor phantom; 3) resolution phantom. Phantom inserts were filled with activity concentrations (ACs) that were derived from clinical data. Phantom data were acquired in list-mode at one bed position. Images with emission data ranging from 30 to 210 s in 30-s increments were reconstructed from a reference image acquired with 3.5-min emission. Iterative image reconstruction (OSEM), point-spread-function (PSF) and time-of-flight (TOF) options were applied using different iterations, Gaussian filters, and voxel sizes. The criteria for image quality was lesion detectability and lesion quantification, evaluated as contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and maximum AC (peak AC), respectively. A threshold value of CNR above 6 and percentage maximum AC (peak AC) deviation range of ±20% of the reference image were considered acceptable. The proposed single-bed scan time reduction was projected to a whole-body examination (patient validation scan) using the continuous-bed-motion mode.

Results: Sphere and background ACs of 20 kBq/mL and 1 kBq/mL were selected, respectively. The optimized single-bed scan time was approximately 60 s using OSEM-TOF or OSEM-TOF+PSF (four iterations, 4.0-mm Gaussian filter and almost isotropic voxel size of 3.0-mm side length), resulting in a PET spatial resolution of 6.3 mm for OSEM-TOF and 5.5 mm for OSEM-TOF+PSF. In the patient validation, the maximum percentage difference in lesion quantification between standard and optimized protocol (whole-body scan time of 15 vs. 5 min) was below 19%.

Conclusions: A reduction of single-bed and whole-body scan time for [68Ga]Ga-PSMA PET/CT compared to current recommended clinical acquisition protocols is postulated. Clinical studies are warranted to validate the applicability of this protocol.

JOURNAL: Zhongguo yi liao qi xie za zhi = Chinese journal of medical instrumentation

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Objective: Current mainstream PET scattering correction methods are introduced and evaluated horizontally, and finally, the existing problems and development direction of scattering correction are discussed.

Methods: Based on NeuWise Pro PET/CT products of Neusoft Medical System Co. Ltd. , the simulation experiment is carried out to evaluate the influence of radionuclide distribution out of FOV (field of view) on the scattering estimation accuracy of each method.

Results: The scattering events produced by radionuclide out of FOV have an obvious impact on the spatial distribution of scattering, which should be considered in the model. The scattering estimation accuracy of Monte Carlo method is higher than single scatter simulation (SSS).

Conclusions: Clinically, if the activity of the adjacent parts out of the FOV is high, such as brain, liver, kidney and bladder, it is likely to lead to the deviation of scattering estimation. Considering the Monte Carlo scattering estimation of the distribution of radionuclide out of FOV, it's helpful to improve the accuracy of scattering distribution estimation.

TITLE: Dictionary Learning Constrained Direct Parametric Estimation in Dynamic Myocardial Perfusion PET

AUTHORS: Bao Yang, Xinhui Wang, Andi Li, Jonathan B Moody, Jing Tang

JOURNAL: IEEE transactions on medical imaging

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
In myocardial perfusion imaging with dynamic positron emission tomography (PET), direct parametric reconstruction from the projection data allows accurate modeling of the Poisson noise in the projection domain to provide more reliable estimate of the parametric images. In this study, we propose to incorporate a superior denoiser to efficiently suppress the unfavorable noise propagation during the direct reconstruction. The dictionary learning (DL) based sparse representation serves as a regularization term to constrain the intermediate K1estimation. We rewrite the DL regularizer into a voxel-separable form to facilitate the decoupling of a DL penalized curve fitting from the reconstruction of dynamic frames. The nonlinear fitting is then solved by a damped Newton method with uniform initialization. Using simulated and patient82Rb dynamic PET data, we study the performance of the proposed DL direct algorithm and quantitatively compare it with the indirect method with or without post-filtering, the direct reconstruction without regularization, and the quadratic penalty regularized direct algorithm. The DL regularized direct reconstruction achieves improved noise versus bias performance in the reconstructed K1images as well as superior recovery of a reduced myocardial blood flow defect. The dictionary learned from a 3D self-created hollow sphere image yields comparable results to those using the dictionary learned from the corresponding magnetic resonance image. The uniform initializations converge to K1estimations similar to the result from initializing with the indirect reconstruction. To summarize, we demonstrate the potential of the proposed DL constrained direct parametric reconstruction in improving quantitative dynamic PET imaging.

TITLE: Mitigation of noise-induced bias of PET radiomic features

AUTHORS: Ananthi Somasundaram, David Vállez García, Elisabeth Pfaehler, Joyce van Sluis, Rudi A J O Dierckx, Elisabeth G E de Vries, Ronald Boellaard

JOURNAL: PloS one

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Introduction: One major challenge in PET radiomics is its sensitivity to noise. Low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) affects not only the precision but also the accuracy of quantitative metrics extracted from the images resulting in noise-induced bias. This phantom study aims to identify the radiomic features that are robust to noise in terms of precision and accuracy and to explore some methods that might help to correct noise-induced bias.

Methods: A phantom containing three 18F-FDG filled 3D printed inserts, reflecting heterogeneous tracer uptake and realistic tumor shapes, was used in the study. The three different phantom inserts were filled and scanned with three different tumor-to-background ratios, simulating a total of nine different tumors. From the 40-minute list-mode data, ten frames each for 5 s, 10 s, 30 s, and 120 s frame duration were reconstructed to generate images with different noise levels. Under these noise conditions, the precision and accuracy of the radiomic features were analyzed using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and similarity distance metric (SDM) respectively. Based on the ICC and SDM values, the radiomic features were categorized into four groups: poor, moderate, good, and excellent precision and accuracy. A "difference image" created by subtracting two statistically equivalent replicate images was used to develop a model to correct the noise-induced bias. Several regression methods (e.g., linear, exponential, sigmoid, and power-law) were tested. The best fitting model was chosen based on Akaike information criteria.

Results: Several radiomic features derived from low SNR images have high repeatability, with 68% of radiomic features having ICC ≥ 0.9 for images with a frame duration of 5 s. However, most features show a systematic bias that correlates with the increase in noise level. Out of 143 features with noise-induced bias, the SDM values were improved based on a regression model (53 features to excellent and 67 to good) indicating that the noise-induced bias of these features can be, at least partially, corrected.

Conclusion: To have a predictive value, radiomic features should reflect tumor characteristics and be minimally affected by noise. The present study has shown that it is possible to correct for noise-induced bias, at least in a subset of the features, using a regression model based on the local image noise estimates.

TITLE: Transformer-CNN hybrid network for improving PET time of flight prediction

AUTHORS: Xuhui Feng, Amanjule Muhashi, Yuya Onishi, Ryosuke Ota, Huafeng Liu

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Objective.In positron emission tomography (PET) reconstruction, the integration of time-of-flight (TOF) information, known as TOF-PET, has been a major research focus. Compared to traditional reconstruction methods, the introduction of TOF enhances the signal-to-noise ratio of images. Precision in TOF is measured by full width at half maximum (FWHM) and the offset from ground truth, referred to as coincidence time resolution (CTR) and bias.Approach.This study proposes a network combining transformer and convolutional neural network (CNN) to utilize TOF information from detector waveforms, using event waveform pairs as inputs. This approach integrates the global self-attention mechanism of Transformer, which focuses on temporal relationships, with the local receptive field of CNN. The combination of global and local information allows the network to assign greater weight to the rising edges of waveforms, thereby extracting valuable temporal information for precise TOF predictions. Experiments were conducted using lutetium yttrium oxyorthosilicate (LYSO) scintillators and silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) detectors. The network was trained and tested using the waveform datasets after cropping.Main results.Compared to the constant fraction discriminator (CFD), CNN, CNN with attention, long short-term memory (LSTM) and Transformer, our network achieved an average CTR of 189 ps, reducing it by 82 ps (more than 30%), 13 ps (6.4%), 12 ps (6.0%), 16 ps (7.8%) and 9 ps (4.6%), respectively. Additionally, a reduction of 10.3, 8.7, 6.7 and 4 ps in average bias was achieved compared to CNN, CNN with attention, LSTM and Transformer.Significance.This work demonstrates the potential of applying the Transformer for PET TOF estimation using real experimental data. Through the integration of both CNN and Transformer with local and global attention, it achieves optimal performance, thereby presenting a novel direction for future research in this field.

TITLE: Compressed representation of brain genetic transcription

AUTHORS: James K Ruffle, Henry Watkins, Robert J Gray, Harpreet Hyare, Michel Thiebaut de Schotten, Parashkev Nachev

JOURNAL: Human brain mapping

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
The architecture of the brain is too complex to be intuitively surveyable without the use of compressed representations that project its variation into a compact, navigable space. The task is especially challenging with high-dimensional data, such as gene expression, where the joint complexity of anatomical and transcriptional patterns demands maximum compression. The established practice is to use standard principal component analysis (PCA), whose computational felicity is offset by limited expressivity, especially at great compression ratios. Employing whole-brain, voxel-wise Allen Brain Atlas transcription data, here we systematically compare compressed representations based on the most widely supported linear and non-linear methods-PCA, kernel PCA, non-negative matrix factorisation (NMF), t-stochastic neighbour embedding (t-SNE), uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP), and deep auto-encoding-quantifying reconstruction fidelity, anatomical coherence, and predictive utility across signalling, microstructural, and metabolic targets, drawn from large-scale open-source MRI and PET data. We show that deep auto-encoders yield superior representations across all metrics of performance and target domains, supporting their use as the reference standard for representing transcription patterns in the human brain.

JOURNAL: Scientific reports

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
The integrated positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI) scanner simultaneously acquires metabolic information via PET and morphological information using MRI. However, attenuation correction, which is necessary for quantitative PET evaluation, is difficult as it requires the generation of attenuation-correction maps from MRI, which has no direct relationship with the gamma-ray attenuation information. MRI-based bone tissue segmentation is potentially available for attenuation correction in relatively rigid and fixed organs such as the head and pelvis regions. However, this is challenging for the chest region because of respiratory and cardiac motions in the chest, its anatomically complicated structure, and the thin bone cortex. We propose a new method using unsupervised generative attentional networks with adaptive layer-instance normalisation for image-to-image translation (U-GAT-IT), which specialised in unpaired image transformation based on attention maps for image transformation. We added the modality-independent neighbourhood descriptor (MIND) to the loss of U-GAT-IT to guarantee anatomical consistency in the image transformation between different domains. Our proposed method obtained a synthesised computed tomography of the chest. Experimental results showed that our method outperforms current approaches. The study findings suggest the possibility of synthesising clinically acceptable computed tomography images from chest MRI with minimal changes in anatomical structures without human annotation.

ABSTRACT:
Introduction: Non-invasive detection of pathological changes in thoracic aortic disease remains an unmet clinical need particularly for patients with congenital heart disease. Positron emission tomography combined with magnetic resonance imaging (PET-MRI) could provide a valuable low-radiation method of aortic surveillance in high-risk groups. Quantification of aortic microcalcification activity using sodium [18F]fluoride holds promise in the assessment of thoracic aortopathies. We sought to evaluate aortic sodium [18F]fluoride uptake in PET-MRI using three methods of attenuation correction compared to positron emission tomography computed tomography (PET-CT) in patients with bicuspid aortic valve, METHODS: Thirty asymptomatic patients under surveillance for bicuspid aortic valve disease underwent sodium [18F]fluoride PET-CT and PET-MRI of the ascending thoracic aorta during a single visit. PET-MRI data were reconstructed using three iterations of attenuation correction (Dixon, radial gradient recalled echo with two [RadialVIBE-2] or four [RadialVIBE-4] tissue segmentation). Images were qualitatively and quantitatively analysed for aortic sodium [18F]fluoride uptake on PET-CT and PET-MRI.

Results: Aortic sodium [18F]fluoride uptake on PET-MRI was visually comparable with PET-CT using each reconstruction and total aortic standardised uptake values on PET-CT strongly correlated with each PET-MRI attenuation correction method (Dixon R = 0.70; RadialVIBE-2 R = 0.63; RadialVIBE-4 R = 0.64; p < 0.001 for all). Breathing related artefact between soft tissue and lung were detected using Dixon and RadialVIBE-4 but not RadialVIBE-2 reconstructions, with the presence of this artefact adjacent to the atria leading to variations in blood pool activity estimates. Consequently, quantitative agreements between radiotracer activity on PET-CT and PET-MRI were most consistent with RadialVIBE-2.

Conclusion: Ascending aortic microcalcification analysis in PET-MRI is feasible with comparable findings to PET-CT. RadialVIBE-2 tissue attenuation correction correlates best with the reference standard of PET-CT and is less susceptible to artefact. There remain challenges in segmenting tissue types in PET-MRI reconstructions, and improved attenuation correction methods are required.

ABSTRACT:
Quantitative evaluation of radiolabeled prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET scans may be used to monitor treatment response in patients with prostate cancer (PCa). To interpret longitudinal differences in PSMA uptake, the intrinsic variability of tracer uptake in PCa lesions needs to be defined. The aim of this study was to investigate the repeatability of quantitative PET/CT measurements using18F-DCFPyL ([2-(3-(1-carboxy-5-[(6-18F-fluoro-pyridine-3-carbonyl)-amino]-pentyl)-ureido)-pentanedioic acid], a second-generation18F-PSMA-ligand) in patients with PCa.Methods:Twelve patients with metastatic PCa were prospectively included, of whom 2 were excluded from final analyses. Patients received 2 whole-body18F-DCFPyL PET/CT scans (median dose, 317 MBq; uptake time, 120 min) within a median of 4 d (range, 1-11 d). After semiautomatic (isocontour-based) tumor delineation, the following lesion-based metrics were derived: mean, peak, and maximum tumor-to-blood ratio; SUVmean, SUVpeak, and SUVmaxnormalized to body weight; tumor volume; and total lesion uptake (TLU). Additionally, patient-based total tumor volume (TTV) (sum of PSMA-positive tumor volumes) and total tumor burden (TTB) (sum of all lesion TLUs) were derived. Repeatability was analyzed using repeatability coefficients (RC) and intraclass correlation coefficients. Additionally, the effect of point-spread function (PSF) image reconstruction on the repeatability of uptake metrics was evaluated.Results:In total, 3618F-DCFPyL PET-positive lesions were analyzed (≤5 lesions per patient). The RCs for mean, peak, and maximum tumor-to-blood ratio were 31.8%, 31.7%, and 37.3%, respectively. For SUVmean, SUVpeak, and SUVmax, the RCs were 24.4%, 25.3%, and 31.0%, respectively. All intraclass correlation coefficients were at least 0.97. Tumor volume delineations were quite repeatable, with an RC of 28.1% for individual lesion volumes and 17.0% for TTV. TTB had an RC of 23.2% and 33.4% when based on SUVmeanand mean tumor-to-blood ratio, respectively. Small lesions (<4.2 cm3) had worse repeatability for volume measurements. The repeatability of SUVpeak, TLU, and all patient-level metrics was not affected by PSF reconstruction.Conclusion:18F-DCFPyL uptake measurements are quite repeatable and can be used for clinical validation in future treatment response assessment studies. Patient-based TTV may be preferred for multicenter studies because its repeatability was both high and robust to different image reconstructions.

TITLE: Intelligent ultrafast total-body PET for sedation-free pediatric [18F]FDG imaging

AUTHORS: Xiang Zhou, Yu Fu, Shunjie Dong, Lianghua Li, Song Xue, Ruohua Chen, Gang Huang, Jianjun Liu, Kuangyu Shi

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: This study aims to develop deep learning techniques on total-body PET to bolster the feasibility of sedation-free pediatric PET imaging.

Methods: A deformable 3D U-Net was developed based on 245 adult subjects with standard total-body PET imaging for the quality enhancement of simulated rapid imaging. The developed method was first tested on 16 children receiving total-body [18F]FDG PET scans with standard 300-s acquisition time with sedation. Sixteen rapid scans (acquisition time about 3 s, 6 s, 15 s, 30 s, and 75 s) were retrospectively simulated by selecting the reconstruction time window. In the end, the developed methodology was prospectively tested on five children without sedation to prove the routine feasibility.

Results: The approach significantly improved the subjective image quality and lesion conspicuity in abdominal and pelvic regions of the generated 6-s data. In the first test set, the proposed method enhanced the objective image quality metrics of 6-s data, such as PSNR (from 29.13 to 37.09, p < 0.01) and SSIM (from 0.906 to 0.921, p < 0.01). Furthermore, the errors of mean standardized uptake values (SUVmean) for lesions between 300-s data and 6-s data were reduced from 12.9 to 4.1% (p < 0.01), and the errors of max SUV (SUVmax) were reduced from 17.4 to 6.2% (p < 0.01). In the prospective test, radiologists reached a high degree of consistency on the clinical feasibility of the enhanced PET images.

Conclusion: The proposed method can effectively enhance the image quality of total-body PET scanning with ultrafast acquisition time, leading to meeting clinical diagnostic requirements of lesion detectability and quantification in abdominal and pelvic regions. It has much potential to solve the dilemma of the use of sedation and long acquisition time that influence the health of pediatric patients.

JOURNAL: European radiology

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Objectives: To compare lesion features extracted from18F-FDG PET/CT images acquired on analog and digital scanners, on consecutive imaging data from the same subjects.

Methods: Whole-body18F-FDG PET/CT images from 55 oncological patients were acquired twice after a single18F-FDG injection, with a digital and an analog PET/CT scanner, alternately. Twenty-nine subjects were examined first on the digital, and 26 first on the analog equipment. Image reconstruction was performed using manufacturer standard clinical protocols and protocols that fulfilled EARL1 specifications. Twenty-five features based on lesion standardized uptake value (SUV) and geometry were assessed. To compare these features, intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), relative difference (RD), absolute value of RD (|RD|), and repeatability coefficient (RC) were used.

Results: In total, 32318F-FDG avid lesions were identified. High agreement (ICC > 0.75) was obtained for most of the lesion features pulled out from both scanners' imaging data, especially when reconstruction protocols fulfilled EARL1 specifications. For EARL1 reconstruction images, the features frequently used in clinics, SUVmax, SUVpeak, SUVmean, metabolic tumor volume, and total lesion glycolysis, reached an ICC of 0.92, 0.95, 0.87, 0.98, and 0.98, and a median RD (digital-analog) of 3%, 5%, 4%, - 3% and 1%, respectively. Using standard reconstruction protocols, the ICC were 0.84, 0.93, 0.80, 0.98, and 0.98, and the RD were 20%, 11%, 13%, - 7%, and 7%, respectively.

Conclusion: Under controlled acquisition and reconstruction parameters, most of the features studied can be used for research and clinical work. This is especially important for multicenter studies and patient follow-ups.

Key points: • Using manufacturer standard clinical reconstruction protocols, lesions SUV was significantly higher when using the digital scanner, especially the SUVmaxthat was approximately 20% higher. • High agreement was obtained for the majority of the lesion features when using reconstruction protocols that fulfilled EARL1 specifications. • Longitudinal patient studies can be performed interchangeably between digital and analog scanners when both fulfill EARL1 specifications.

TITLE: Multimodal Medical Image Fusion Based on Content-based and PCA-sigmoid

AUTHORS: Srinivasu Polinati, Durga Prasad Bavirisetti, Kandala N V P S Rajesh, Ravindra Dhuli

JOURNAL: Current medical imaging

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Objective: The objective of any multimodal medical image fusion algorithm is to assist a radiologist for better decision-making during the diagnosis and therapy by integrating the anatomical (magnetic resonance imaging) and functional (positron emission tomography/ single-photon emission computed tomography) information.

Methods: We proposed a new medical image fusion method based on content-based decomposition, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and sigmoid function. We considered Empirical Wavelet Transform (EWT) for content-based decomposition purposes since it can preserve crucial medical image information such as edges and corners. PCA is used to obtain initial weights corresponding to each detail layer.

Results: In our experiments, we found that direct usage of PCA for detail layer fusion introduces severe artifacts into the fused image due to weight scaling issues. In order to tackle this, we considered using the sigmoid function for better weight scaling. We considered 24 pairs of MRI-PET and 24 pairs of MRI-SPECT images for fusion, and the results are measured using four significant quantitative metrics.

Conclusion: Finally, we compared our proposed method with other state-of-the-art transformbased fusion approaches, using traditional and recent performance measures. An appreciable improvement is observed in both qualitative and quantitative results compared to other fusion methods.

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Objective. Deep learning denoising networks are typically trained with images that are representative of the testing data. Due to the large variability of the noise levels in positron emission tomography (PET) images, it is challenging to develop a proper training set for general clinical use. Our work aims to develop a personalized denoising strategy for the low-count PET images at various noise levels.Approach.We first investigated the impact of the noise level in the training images on the model performance. Five 3D U-Net models were trained on five groups of images at different noise levels, and a one-size-fits-all model was trained on images covering a wider range of noise levels. We then developed a personalized weighting method by linearly blending the results from two models trained on 20%-count level images and 60%-count level images to balance the trade-off between noise reduction and spatial blurring. By adjusting the weighting factor, denoising can be conducted in a personalized and task-dependent way.Main results.The evaluation results of the six models showed that models trained on noisier images had better performance in denoising but introduced more spatial blurriness, and the one-size-fits-all model did not generalize well when deployed for testing images with a wide range of noise levels. The personalized denoising results showed that noisier images require higher weights on noise reduction to maximize the structural similarity and mean squared error. And model trained on 20%-count level images can produce the best liver lesion detectability.Significance.Our study demonstrated that in deep learning-based low dose PET denoising, noise levels in the training input images have a substantial impact on the model performance. The proposed personalized denoising strategy utilized two training sets to overcome the drawbacks introduced by each individual network and provided a series of denoised results for clinical reading.

TITLE: Simultaneous multifactor Bayesian analysis (SiMBA) of PET time activity curve data

AUTHORS: Granville J Matheson, R Todd Ogden

JOURNAL: NeuroImage

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Positron emission tomography (PET) is an in vivo imaging method essential for studying the neurochemical pathophysiology of psychiatric and neurological disease. However, its high cost and exposure of participants to radiation make it unfeasible to employ large sample sizes. The major shortcoming of PET imaging is therefore its lack of power for studying clinically-relevant research questions. Here, we introduce a new method for performing PET quantification and analysis called SiMBA, which helps to alleviate these issues by improving the efficiency of PET analysis by exploiting similarities between both individuals and regions within individuals. In simulated [11C]WAY100635 data, SiMBA greatly improves both statistical power and the consistency of effect size estimation without affecting the false positive rate. This approach makes use of hierarchical, multifactor, multivariate Bayesian modelling to effectively borrow strength across the whole dataset to improve stability and robustness to measurement error. In so doing, parameter identifiability and estimation are improved, without sacrificing model interpretability. This comes at the cost of increased computational overhead, however this is practically negligible relative to the time taken to collect PET data. This method has the potential to make it possible to test clinically-relevant hypotheses which could never be studied before given the practical constraints. Furthermore, because this method does not require any additional information over and above that required for traditional analysis, it makes it possible to re-examine data which has already previously been collected at great expense. In the absence of dramatic advancements in PET image data quality, radiotracer development, or data sharing, PET imaging has been fundamentally limited in the scope of research hypotheses which could be studied. This method, especially combined with the recent steps taken by the PET imaging community to embrace data sharing, will make it possible to greatly improve the research possibilities and clinical relevance of PET neuroimaging.

TITLE: Optimizing CT Imaging Parameters: Implications for Diagnostic Accuracy in Nuclear Medicine

AUTHORS: Anders F S Mikkelsen, Jesper Thygesen, Joan Fledelius

JOURNAL: Seminars in nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
X-ray computed tomography (CT) is an important companion modality in molecular imaging, offering attenuation correction (AC) of single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) - and positron emission tomography (PET)-data, topographic information in scans as well as changes in morphology in serial follow-up studies. Image quality plays a critical role in delivering an acceptable diagnosis and in medical treatment planning. Variability in protocols can present a considerable challenge in achieving consistent image quality within departments. The differences in CT scanning protocol metrics established by various manufacturers and across different generations of scanners can contribute to this issue, making the standardization of image quality a complex task. This review aims to present relevant literature herein and provide an introduction of the CT imaging parameters, including acquisition factors, reconstruction algorithms, and relevant image quality metrics, and discuss possible ways to implement a robust CT protocol review process in a nuclear medicine department. We also evaluate the potential of iterative reconstruction (IR) and deep learning (DL) for enhancing image quality and minimizing exposure doses. This article points to the need for periodic audit of image quality to guarantee that CT protocols are suited for the intended purpose. Through the creation of local diagnostic reference levels and monitoring performance through protocol management, physicians may aim at delivering high quality imaging services consistently adhering to the principles of ALARA and reduction of dose for both patients and workers.

TITLE: Recovery of the spatially-variant deformations in dual-panel PET reconstructions using deep-learning

AUTHORS: Juhi Raj, Maël Millardet, Srilalan Krishnamoorthy, Joel S Karp, Suleman Surti, Samuel Matej

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Dual panel PET systems, such as Breast-PET (B-PET) scanner, exhibit strong asymmetric and anisotropic spatially-variant deformations in the reconstructed images due to the limited-angle data and strong depth of interaction effects for the oblique LORs inherent in such systems. In our previous work, we studied time-of-flight (TOF) effects and image-based spatially-variant PSF resolution models within dual-panel PET reconstruction to reduce these deformations. The application of PSF based models led to better and more uniform quantification of small lesions across the field of view (FOV). However, the ability of such a model to correct for PSF deformation is limited to small objects. On the other hand, large object deformations caused by the limited-angle reconstruction cannot be corrected with the PSF modeling alone. In this work, we investigate the ability of deep-learning (DL) networks to recover such strong spatially-variant image deformations using first simulated PSF deformations in image space of a generic dual panel PET system and then using simulated and acquired phantom reconstructions from dual panel B-PET system developed in our lab at University of Pennsylvania. For the studies using real B-PET data, the network was trained on the simulated synthetic data sets providing ground truth for objects resembling experimentally acquired phantoms on which the network deformation corrections were then tested. The synthetic and acquired limited-angle B-PET data were reconstructed using DIRECT-RAMLA reconstructions, which were then used as the network inputs. Our results demonstrate that DL approaches can significantly eliminate deformations of limited angle systems and improve their quantitative performance.

TITLE: A preliminary evaluation of a high temporal resolution data-driven motion correction algorithm for rubidium-82 on a SiPM PET-CT system

AUTHORS: Ian S Armstrong, Charles Hayden, Matthew J Memmott, Parthiban Arumugam

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear cardiology : official publication of the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Background: In myocardial perfusion PET, images are acquired during vasodilator stress, increasing the likelihood of intra-frame motion blurring of the heart in reconstructed static images to assess relative perfusion. This work evaluated a prototype data-driven motion correction (DDMC) algorithm designed specifically for cardiac PET.

Methods: A cardiac torso phantom, with a solid defect, was scanned stationary and being manually pulled to-and-fro in the axial direction with a random motion. Non-motion-corrected (NMC) and DDMC images were reconstructed. Total perfusion deficit was measured in the defect and profiles through the cardiac insert were defined. In addition, 46 static perfusion images from 36 rubidium-82 MPI patients were selected based upon a perception of motion blurring in the images. NMC and DDMC images were reconstructed, blinded, and scored on image quality and perceived motion.

Results: Phantom data demonstrated near-perfect recovery of myocardial wall visualization and defect quantification with DDMC compared with the stationary phantom. Quality of clinical images was NMC: 10 non-diagnostic, 31 adequate, and 5 good; DDMC images: 0 non-diagnostic, 6 adequate, and 40 good.

Conclusion: The DDMC algorithm shows great promise in rubidium MPI PET with substantial improvements in image quality and the potential to salvage images considered non-diagnostic due to significant motion blurring.

JOURNAL: Annals of nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Objectives: This study evaluates the phantom attenuation correction (PAC) method as an alternative to maximum-likelihood attenuation correction factor (ML-ACF) correction in time-of-flight (TOF) brain positron emission tomography (PET) studies.

Methods: In the PAC algorithm, a template emission image [Formula: see text] and a template attenuation coefficient image [Formula: see text] are prepared as a data set based on phantom geometry. Position-aligned attenuation coefficient image [Formula: see text] is derived by aligning [Formula: see text] using parameters that match the template emission image [Formula: see text] to measured emission image [Formula: see text]. Then, attenuation coefficient image [Formula: see text] combined with a headrest image is used for scatter and attenuation correction in the image reconstruction. To evaluate the PAC algorithm as an alternative to ML-ACF, Hoffman 3D brain and cylindrical phantoms were measured to obtain the image quality indexes of contrast and uniformity. These phantoms were also wrapped with a radioactive sheet to obtain attenuation coefficient images using ML-ACF. Emission images were reconstructed with attenuation correction by PAC and ML-ACF, and the results were compared using contrast and uniformity as well as visual assessment. CT attenuation correction (CT-AC) was also applied as a reference.

Results: The contrast obtained by ML-ACF was slightly overestimated due to its unique experimental condition for applying ML-ACF in Hoffman 3D brain phantom but the uniformity was almost equivalent among ML-ACF, CT-AC, and PAC. PAC showed reasonable result without overestimation compared to ML-ACF and CT-AC.

Conclusions: PAC is an attenuation correction method that can ensure the performance in phantom test, and is considered to be a reasonable alternative to clinically used ML-ACF-based attenuation correction.

TITLE: Deconvolution-based partial volume correction of PET images with parallel level set regularization

AUTHORS: Yansong Zhu, Murat Bilgel, Yuanyuan Gao, Olivier G Rousset, Susan M Resnick, Dean F Wong, Arman Rahmim

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
The partial volume effect (PVE), caused by the limited spatial resolution of positron emission tomography (PET), degrades images both qualitatively and quantitatively. Anatomical information provided by magnetic resonance (MR) images has the potential to play an important role in partial volume correction (PVC) methods. Post-reconstruction MR-guided PVC methods typically use segmented MR tissue maps, and further, assume that PET activity distribution is uniform in each region, imposing considerable constraints through anatomical guidance. In this work, we present a post-reconstruction PVC method based on deconvolution with parallel level set (PLS) regularization. We frame the problem as an iterative deconvolution task with PLS regularization that incorporates anatomical information without requiring MR segmentation or assuming uniformity of PET distributions within regions. An efficient algorithm for non-smooth optimization of the objective function (invoking split Bregman framework) is developed so that the proposed method can be feasibly applied to 3D images and produces sharper images compared to PLS method with smooth optimization. The proposed method was evaluated together with several other PVC methods using both realistic simulation experiments based on the BrainWeb phantom as well asin vivohuman data. Our proposed method showed enhanced quantitative performance when realistic MR guidance was provided. Further, the proposed method is able to reduce image noise while preserving structure details onin vivohuman data, and shows the potential to better differentiate amyloid positive and amyloid negative scans. Overall, our results demonstrate promise to provide superior performance in clinical imaging scenarios.

TITLE: Exploring de-anonymization risks in PET imaging: Insights from a comprehensive analysis of 853 patient scans

AUTHORS: Emma Bou Hanna, Sebastian Partarrieu, Arnaud Berenbaum, Stéphanie Allassonnière, Florent L Besson

JOURNAL: Scientific data

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Due to their high resolution, anonymized CT scans can be reidentified using face recognition tools. However, little is known regarding PET deanonymization because of its lower resolution. In this study, we analysed PET/CT scans of 853 patients from a TCIA-restricted dataset (AutoPET). First, we built denoised 2D morphological reconstructions of both PET and CT scans, and then we determined how frequently a PET reconstruction could be matched to the correct CT reconstruction with no other metadata. Using the CT morphological reconstructions as ground truth allows us to frame the problem as a face recognition problem and to quantify our performance using traditional metrics (top k accuracies) without any use of patient pictures. Using our denoised PET 2D reconstructions, we achieved 72% top 10 accuracy after the realignment of all CTs in the same reference frame, and 71% top 10 accuracy after realignment and mixing within a larger face dataset of 10, 168 pictures. This highlights the need to consider face identification issues when dealing with PET imaging data.

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Attenuation correction is a critically important step in data correction in positron emission tomography (PET) image formation. The current standard method involves conversion of Hounsfield units from a computed tomography (CT) image to construct attenuation maps (µ-maps) at 511 keV. In this work, the increased sensitivity of long axial field-of-view (LAFOV) PET scanners was exploited to develop and evaluate a deep learning (DL) and joint reconstruction-based method to generate µ-maps utilizing background radiation from lutetium-based (LSO) scintillators.

Methods: Data from 18 subjects were used to train convolutional neural networks to enhance initial µ-maps generated using joint activity and attenuation reconstruction algorithm (MLACF) with transmission data from LSO background radiation acquired before and after the administration of18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) (µ-mapMLACF-PREand µ-mapMLACF-POSTrespectively). The deep learning-enhanced µ-maps (µ-mapDL-MLACF-PREand µ-mapDL-MLACF-POST) were compared against MLACF-derived and CT-based maps (µ-mapCT). The performance of the method was also evaluated by assessing PET images reconstructed using each µ-map and computing volume-of-interest based standard uptake value measurements and percentage relative mean error (rME) and relative mean absolute error (rMAE) relative to CT-based method.

Results: No statistically significant difference was observed in rME values for µ-mapDL-MLACF-PREand µ-mapDL-MLACF-POSTboth in fat-based and water-based soft tissue as well as bones, suggesting that presence of the radiopharmaceutical activity in the body had negligible effects on the resulting µ-maps. The rMAE values µ-mapDL-MLACF-POSTwere reduced by a factor of 3.3 in average compared to the rMAE of µ-mapMLACF-POST. Similarly, the average rMAE values of PET images reconstructed using µ-mapDL-MLACF-POST(PETDL-MLACF-POST) were 2.6 times smaller than the average rMAE values of PET images reconstructed using µ-mapMLACF-POST. The mean absolute errors in SUV values of PETDL-MLACF-POSTcompared to PETCTwere less than 5% in healthy organs, less than 7% in brain grey matter and 4.3% for all tumours combined.

Conclusion: We describe a deep learning-based method to accurately generate µ-maps from PET emission data and LSO background radiation, enabling CT-free attenuation and scatter correction in LAFOV PET scanners.

JOURNAL: Nature communications

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Despite the potential of deep learning (DL)-based methods in substituting CT-based PET attenuation and scatter correction for CT-free PET imaging, a critical bottleneck is their limited capability in handling large heterogeneity of tracers and scanners of PET imaging. This study employs a simple way to integrate domain knowledge in DL for CT-free PET imaging. In contrast to conventional direct DL methods, we simplify the complex problem by a domain decomposition so that the learning of anatomy-dependent attenuation correction can be achieved robustly in a low-frequency domain while the original anatomy-independent high-frequency texture can be preserved during the processing. Even with the training from one tracer on one scanner, the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed approach are confirmed in tests of various external imaging tracers on different scanners. The robust, generalizable, and transparent DL development may enhance the potential of clinical translation.

ABSTRACT:
This paper presents a novel PET geometry for breast cancer imaging. The scanner consists of a 'stadium' (a rectangle with two semi-circles on opposite sides) shaped ring, along with anterior and posterior panels to provide high sensitivity and high spatial resolution for an imaging field-of-view (FOV) that include both breasts, mediastinum and axilla. We simulated this total-breast PET system using GATE and reconstructed the coincidence events using a GPU-based list-mode image reconstruction implementing maximum likelihood expectation-maximization (ML-EM) algorithm. The rear-panel is made up of a single layer of LSO crystals (3.2 × 3.2 × 20 mm3each), while the 'stadium'-shaped elongated ring and the anterior panel are made with dual-layered LSO crystals (1.6 × 1.6 × 6 mm3each). The energy resolution and coincidence resolving time of all detectors are assumed to be 12% and 250 ps full-width-at-half-maximum, respectively. Various sized simulated lesions (4, 5, 6 mm) having 4:1, 5:1, and 6:1 lesion-to-background radioactivity concentration ratios, mimicking different biological uptakes, were strategically located throughout a volumetric torso phantom. We compared system sensitivity and lesion detectability of the dedicated total-breast PET system to a state-of-the-art clinical whole-body PET scanner. The mean sensitivity of the total-breast PET system is 3.21 times greater than that of a whole-body PET scanner in the breast regions. The total-breast PET system also provides better contrast-recovery coefficients for lesions of all sizes and lesion-to-background ratios in the breast when compared to a reference clinical whole-body PET scanner. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) study shows the area under the ROC curve is 0.948 and 0.924 for the total-breast system and the whole-body PET scanner, respectively, in the detection of 4 mm diameter lesions with 4:1 lesion-to-background ratio. This study demonstrates our novel geometry can provide an imaging FOV larger than conventional PEM systems to simultaneously image both breasts, chest wall and axillae with significantly improved lesion detectability in the breasts when compared to a whole-body PET scanner.

JOURNAL: Nuclear medicine review. Central & Eastern Europe

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Background: This study aims to evaluate the performance of a deep learning enhancement method in PET images reconstructed with a shorter acquisition time, and different reconstruction algorithms. The impact of the enhancement on clinical decisions was also assessed.

Material and methods: Thirty-seven subjects underwent clinical whole-body [18F]FDG PET/CT exams with an acquisition time of 1.5 min per bed position. PET images were reconstructed with the OSEM algorithm using 66% counts (imitating 1 min/bed acquisition time) and 100% counts (1.5 min/bed). Images reconstructed from 66% counts were subsequently enhanced using the SubtlePET™ (SP) deep-learning-based software, (Subtle Medical, USA) - with two different software versions (SP1 and SP2). Additionally, images obtained with 66% counts were reconstructed with QClear™ (GE, USA) algorithm and enhanced with SP2. Volumes of interest (VOI) of the lesions and reference VOIs in the liver, brain, bladder, and mediastinum were drawn on OSEM images and copied on SP images. Quantitative SUVmax values per VOI of OSEM or QClear™ and AI-enhanced 'shortened' acquisitions were compared.

Results: Two hundred and fifty-two VOIs were identified (37 for each reference region, and 104 for the lesions) for OSEM, SP1, SP2, and QClear™ images AI-enhanced with SP2. SUVmax values on SP1 images were lower than standard OSEM, but on SP2 differences were smaller (average difference for SP1 11.6%, for SP2 -4.5%). For images reconstructed with QClear™, SUVmax values were higher (average +8.9%, median 6.1%, SD 18.9%). For small lesions with SUVmax values range 2.0 to 4.0 decrease of measured SUVmax was much less significant with SP2 (for liver average -6.5%, median -5.6% for lesions average -5.6%, median - 6.0, SD 5.2%) and showed the best correlation with original OSEM. While no artifacts and good general diagnostic confidence were found in AI-enhanced images, SP1, the images were not equal to the original OSEM - some lesions were hard to spot. SP2 produced images with almost the same quality as the original 1.5 min/bed OSEM reconstruction.

Conclusions: The studied deep learning enhancement method can be used to accelerate PET acquisitions without compromising quantitative SUVmax values. AI-based algorithms can enhance the image quality of accelerated PET acquisitions, enabling the dose reduction to the patients and improving the cost-effectiveness of PET/CT imaging.

ABSTRACT:
Carimas is a multi-purpose medical imaging data processing tool, which can be used to visualize, analyze, and model different medical images in research. Originally, it was developed only for positron emission tomography data in 2009, but the use of this software has extended to many other tomography imaging modalities, such as computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. Carimas is especially well-suited for analysis of three- and four-dimensional image data and creating polar maps in modeling of cardiac perfusion. This article explores various parts of Carimas, including its key features, program structure, and application possibilities.

TITLE: Multimodal image synthesis based on disentanglement representations of anatomical and modality specific features, learned using uncooperative relativistic GAN

AUTHORS: Sureerat Reaungamornrat, Hasan Sari, Ciprian Catana, Ali Kamen

JOURNAL: Medical image analysis

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Growing number of methods for attenuation-coefficient map estimation from magnetic resonance (MR) images have recently been proposed because of the increasing interest in MR-guided radiotherapy and the introduction of positron emission tomography (PET) MR hybrid systems. We propose a deep-network ensemble incorporating stochastic-binary-anatomical encoders and imaging-modality variational autoencoders, to disentangle image-latent spaces into a space of modality-invariant anatomical features and spaces of modality attributes. The ensemble integrates modality-modulated decoders to normalize features and image intensities based on imaging modality. Besides promoting disentanglement, the architecture fosters uncooperative learning, offering ability to maintain anatomical structure in a cross-modality reconstruction. Introduction of a modality-invariant structural consistency constraint further enforces faithful embedding of anatomy. To improve training stability and fidelity of synthesized modalities, the ensemble is trained in a relativistic generative adversarial framework incorporating multiscale discriminators. Analyses of priors and network architectures as well as performance validation were performed on computed tomography (CT) and MR pelvis datasets. The proposed method demonstrated robustness against intensity inhomogeneity, improved tissue-class differentiation, and offered synthetic CT in Hounsfield units with intensities consistent and smooth across slices compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, offering median normalized mutual information of 1.28, normalized cross correlation of 0.97, and gradient cross correlation of 0.59 over 324 images.

TITLE: High-temporal-resolution dynamic PET imaging based on a kinetic-induced voxel filter

AUTHORS: Liwen Fu, Zixiang Chen, Yanhua Duan, Zhaoping Cheng, Lingxin Chen, Yongfeng Yang, Hairong Zheng, Dong Liang, Zhi-Feng Pang, Zhanli Hu

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Objective. Dynamic positron emission tomography (dPET) is an important molecular imaging technology that is used for the clinical diagnosis, staging, and treatment of various human cancers. Higher temporal imaging resolutions are desired for the early stages of radioactive tracer metabolism. However, images reconstructed from raw data with shorter frame durations have lower image signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and unexpected spatial resolutions.Approach. To address these issues, this paper proposes a kinetic-induced voxel filtering technique for processing noisy and distorted dPET images. This method extracts the inherent motion information contained in the target PET image and effectively uses this information to construct an image filter for each PET image frame. To ensure that the filtered image remains undistorted, we integrate and reorganize the information from each frame along the temporal dimension. In addition, our method applies repeated filtering operations to the image to produce optimal denoising results.Main results. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated on both simulated and clinical dPET data, with quantitative evaluations of dynamic images and pharmacokinetic parameter maps calculated via the peak SNR and mean structural similarity index measure. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, our method achieves superior results in both qualitative and quantitative imaging scenarios.Significance. It exhibits commendable performance and high interpretability and is demonstrated to be both effective and feasible in high-temporal-resolution dynamic PET imaging tasks.

ABSTRACT:
Demarcation of small pancreatic and metastatic abdominal lesions is challenging due to the noisy background. We evaluated the impact of time-of-flight (TOF) in conjunction with TrueX (= point spread function (PSF)-based algorithm) or Q.Clear (= Bayesian penalized likelihood reconstruction algorithm) in dual-phase (DP)18F-FDG-PET/CT on image quality (IQ) and lesion detection rate in staging suspected pancreatic cancer. This prospective single-center study included 120 patients. A total of 908 lesions were evaluated by three board-certified nuclear medicine physicians. IQ, SUVmax, and lesion volume (V) of pancreatic lesions, lymph node metastases, organ metastases, and other benign lesions were compared between TOF and non-TOF. All pancreatic lesions were histopathologically confirmed, and all other lesions were confirmed either histopathologically or radiologically. IQ and lesion demarcation were scored on a 6-point Likert-type scale. Overall IQ and demarcation of pancreatic lesions (PLD) were very good in TOF-images (overall IQ, non-TOF, 2.2; TOF, 1.8, P = 0.017; PLD, non-TOF, 2.6, TOF, 2.2, P < 0.001). Thirty-four additional lesions in 23 (19%) patients were detected using TOF alone (mean [SD] SUVmax4.6 [1.5]; mean [SD] V 2.6 cm3[1.3]). 18/23 metastatic lesions identified with TOF alone led to treatment change in 8 patients. SUVmaxwas significantly increased (P< 0.001), whereas V was significantly decreased in TOF images (P = 0.002). Application of TOF poses additional value in detecting small pancreatic and metastatic lesions, which has an impact on further treatment, avoiding unnecessary surgery.

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Clinical whole-body (WB) PET images can be compensated for respiratory motion using data-driven gating (DDG). However, PET DDG images may still exhibit motion artefacts at the diaphragm if the CT is acquired in a different respiratory phase than the PET image. This study evaluates the combined use of PET DDG and a deep-learning model (AIR-PETCT) for elastic registration of CT (WarpCT) to the non attenuation- and non scatter-corrected PET image (PET NAC), enabling improved PET reconstruction.

Methods: The validation cohort included 20 patients referred for clinical FDG PET/CT, undergoing two CT scans: a free respiration CTfreeand an end-expiration breath-hold CTex. AIR-PETCT registered each CT to the PET NAC and PET DDG NAC images. The image quality of PET and PET DDG images reconstructed using CTs and WarpCTs was evaluated by three blinded readers. Additionally, a clinical impact cohort of 20 patients with significant "banana" artefacts from FDG, PSMA, and DOTATOC scans was assessed for image quality and tumor-to-background ratios.

Results: AIR-PETCT was robust and generated consistent WarpCTs when registering different CTs to the same PET NAC. The use of WarpCT instead of CT consistently led to equivalent or improved PET image quality. The algorithm significantly reduced "banana" artefacts and improved lesion-to-background ratios around the diaphragm. The blinded clinicians clearly preferred PET DDG images reconstructed using WarpCT.

Conclusion: AIR-PETCT effectively reduces respiratory motion artefacts from PET images, while improving lesion contrast. The combination of PET DDG and WarpCT holds promise for clinical application, improving PET image evaluation and diagnostic confidence.

TITLE: Cross noise level PET denoising with continuous adversarial domain generalization

ABSTRACT:
Objective.Performing positron emission tomography (PET) denoising within the image space proves effective in reducing the variance in PET images. In recent years, deep learning has demonstrated superior denoising performance, but models trained on a specific noise level typically fail to generalize well on different noise levels, due to inherent distribution shifts between inputs. The distribution shift usually results in bias in the denoised images. Our goal is to tackle such a problem using a domain generalization technique.Approach.We propose to utilize the domain generalization technique with a novel feature space continuous discriminator (CD) for adversarial training, using the fraction of events as a continuous domain label. The core idea is to enforce the extraction of noise-level invariant features. Thus minimizing the distribution divergence of latent feature representation for different continuous noise levels, and making the model general for arbitrary noise levels. We created three sets of 10%, 13%-22% (uniformly randomly selected), or 25% fractions of events from 9718F-MK6240 tau PET studies of 60 subjects. For each set, we generated 20 noise realizations. Training, validation, and testing were implemented using 1400, 120, and 420 pairs of 3D image volumes from the same or different sets. We used 3D UNet as the baseline and implemented CD to the continuous noise level training data of 13%-22% set.Main results.The proposed CD improves the denoising performance of our model trained in a 13%-22% fraction set for testing in both 10% and 25% fraction sets, measured by bias and standard deviation using full-count images as references. In addition, our CD method can improve the SSIM and PSNR consistently for Alzheimer-related regions and the whole brain.Significance.To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to alleviate the performance degradation in cross-noise level denoising from the perspective of domain generalization. Our study is also a pioneer work of continuous domain generalization to utilize continuously changing source domains.

TITLE: Timing offset calibration for TOF PET using stationary line source scans at multiple positions

AUTHORS: Ang Li, Xuan Zhang, Xiaoyun Zhou, Lei Fang, Junpeng Hu, Bingxuan Li, Bo Zhang, Qingguo Xie, Fei Li, Peng Xiao

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Background. Accurate timing offset calibration is crucial for time-of-flight (TOF) positron emission tomography (PET) to mitigate image artifacts and improve quantitative accuracy. However, existing methods are often time-consuming, complex, or costly.Objective. This paper presents a method for TOF PET timing offset calibration that eliminates the need for costly equipment, phantoms, short-half-life sources, and precise source positioning.Approach. We estimate channel timing offsets using stationary scans of a68Ge line source, typically used for routine quality control, at a minimum of three non-coplanar positions, with each position scanned for two minutes. The line source positions are accurately determined by applying a simple algorithm to their reconstructed images, allowing precise calculation of arrival time differences. Channel timing offsets are estimated by solving a least squares problem. This method is assessed through analyses of phantoms and patient images using a RAYSOLUTION DigitMI 930 scanner.Main results. The estimated timing offsets ranged from -500 ps to 500 ps across all channels. Calibration with a minimum of three scanned positions was sufficient to correct these offsets, achieving less than a 1% discrepancy across various metrics of the image quality (IQ) phantom compared to 12 positions. This calibration significantly reduced edge artifacts in TOF reconstruction of both phantoms and patients. Furthermore, the IQ phantom displayed a 14% increase in average contrast recovery, a 61% reduction in average background variability across all spheres, and a 90% reduction in average residual error. Consistent with the phantom results, patient data revealed enhancements in maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmax) from 14% to 55% for lesions measuring 6 mm to 14 mm. The calibration also improved lesion-to-background contrast and eliminated artifacts caused by the spillover effect of the kidneys and bladder.Significance. The proposed method is fast, user-friendly, and cost-effective, effectively improving lesion detection and diagnostic accuracy.

TITLE: Characterization of time of flight and resolution modeling on image quality in positron emission tomography

AUTHORS: Terrance J Moretti, Stephanie M Leon, Colin J Schaeffer, Manuel Arreola

JOURNAL: Journal of applied clinical medical physics

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Time-of-flight (TOF) and resolution modeling (RM) algorithms are frequently used in clinical PET images, and inclusion of these corrections should measurably improve image quality. We quantified the effects of these correction algorithms on reconstructed images via the following metrics: recovery coefficients (RCs), contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), noise-power spectrum (NPS), modulation transfer function (MTF), and the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of a point source. The goal of this experiment was to assess the effects of the correction algorithms when applied singly or together. Two different phantom tests were performed and analyzed by custom software. FWHM and MTF were measured using capillary tube point sources, while RCs, CNR, and NPS were measured using an image quality body phantom. Images were reconstructed with both TOF and RM, only TOF, only RM, or neither correction. The remaining reconstruction parameters used the standard clinical protocol. RM improved RCs, FWHM, and MTF, without increasing overall noise significantly. TOF improves CNR for small objects FWHM or MTF but did not decrease noise. RCs were not statistically improved by enabling these algorithms. Inclusion of both correction algorithms in image reconstruction provides an overall improvement to all metrics relative to the uncorrected image, but not by a significant margin in multiple aspects.

TITLE: Repeatability of Radiomic Features of Brown Adipose Tissue

AUTHORS: Aria Nazeri, John P Crandall, Tyler J Fraum, Richard L Wahl

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
The aim of this study was to assess the repeatability of activated brown adipose tissue (BAT) radiomic features. To decipher radiomic features that may provide useful information on BAT, the impact of reconstruction methods and imaging modality choice was also evaluated.Methods:Twenty-seven healthy adults enrolled in this study. After a cooling procedure to activate BAT, volunteers underwent18F-FDG imaging. Participants underwent repeat imaging using the same imaging protocols and a similar18F-FDG dose within 14 d. Active BAT was segmented using the BARCIST 1.0 methods. Radiomic features were extracted from each region of interest on high-definition PET (HD PET), non-HD PET, and CT images. Lin's concordance correlation coefficient was used to estimate the repeatability of the extracted radiomic features. To determine whether BAT radiomic feature repeatability correlates with BAT SUVmaxrepeatability, participants were stratified based on the relative difference in SUVmaxbetween sessions. Non-HD PET repeatable features were clustered together using hierarchical clustering, and the normalized dynamic range of each feature was computed to identify the most informative feature within each cluster.Results:Eighteen of the 27 volunteers had sufficient BAT activity for radiomic analysis. Sixty-six HD PET, 66 non-HD PET, and 6 CT features showed high repeatability (concordance correlation coefficient ≥ 0.80). Feature repeatability was significantly higher for PET than for CT, but there was no statistically significant difference between HD and non-HD PET in radiomic feature repeatability. The repeatability of radiomic features extracted from each modality and reconstruction method type followed the trend in SUVmax, as participants with lower relative differences in SUVmaxbetween initial and repeated imaging sessions had higher radiomic feature repeatability. Hierarchical clustering of the high-repeatability PET features resulted in 10 highly correlated clusters (R2≥ 0.95). Seven features, including SUVmax,did not cluster with any other features.Conclusion:Several clusters of highly repeatable BAT radiomic features derived from18F-FDG PET/CT appear to provide information regarding BAT activity distinct from SUVmaxThese features might be explored as quantitative imaging biomarkers of BAT activity in future studies.

TITLE: VANet: a medical image fusion model based on attention mechanism to assist disease diagnosis

AUTHORS: Kai Guo, Xiongfei Li, Tiehu Fan, Xiaohan Hu

JOURNAL: BMC bioinformatics

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Background: Today's biomedical imaging technology has been able to present the morphological structure or functional metabolic information of organisms at different scale levels, such as organ, tissue, cell, molecule and gene. However, different imaging modes have different application scope, advantages and disadvantages. In order to improve the role of medical image in disease diagnosis, the fusion of biomedical image information at different imaging modes and scales has become an important research direction in medical image. Traditional medical image fusion methods are all designed to measure the activity level and fusion rules. They are lack of mining the context features of different modes of image, which leads to the obstruction of improving the quality of fused images.

Method: In this paper, an attention-multiscale network medical image fusion model based on contextual features is proposed. The model selects five backbone modules in the VGG-16 network to build encoders to obtain the contextual features of medical images. It builds the attention mechanism branch to complete the fusion of global contextual features and designs the residual multiscale detail processing branch to complete the fusion of local contextual features. Finally, it completes the cascade reconstruction of features by the decoder to obtain the fused image.

Results: Ten sets of images related to five diseases are selected from the AANLIB database to validate the VANet model. Structural images are derived from MR images with high resolution and functional images are derived from SPECT and PET images that are good at describing organ blood flow levels and tissue metabolism. Fusion experiments are performed on twelve fusion algorithms including the VANet model. The model selects eight metrics from different aspects to build a fusion quality evaluation system to complete the performance evaluation of the fused images. Friedman's test and the post-hoc Nemenyi test are introduced to conduct professional statistical tests to demonstrate the superiority of VANet model.

Conclusions: The VANet model completely captures and fuses the texture details and color information of the source images. From the fusion results, the metabolism and structural information of the model are well expressed and there is no interference of color information on the structure and texture; in terms of the objective evaluation system, the metric value of the VANet model is generally higher than that of other methods.; in terms of efficiency, the time consumption of the model is acceptable; in terms of scalability, the model is not affected by the input order of source images and can be extended to tri-modal fusion.

TITLE: FDG-PET to T1 Weighted MRI Translation with 3D Elicit Generative Adversarial Network (E-GAN)

AUTHORS: Farideh Bazangani, Frédéric J P Richard, Badih Ghattas, Eric Guedj, Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative

JOURNAL: Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
With the strengths of deep learning, computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) is a hot topic for researchers in medical image analysis. One of the main requirements for training a deep learning model is providing enough data for the network. However, in medical images, due to the difficulties of data collection and data privacy, finding an appropriate dataset (balanced, enough samples, etc.) is quite a challenge. Although image synthesis could be beneficial to overcome this issue, synthesizing 3D images is a hard task. The main objective of this paper is to generate 3D T1 weighted MRI corresponding to FDG-PET. In this study, we propose a separable convolution-based Elicit generative adversarial network (E-GAN). The proposed architecture can reconstruct 3D T1 weighted MRI from 2D high-level features and geometrical information retrieved from a Sobel filter. Experimental results on the ADNI datasets for healthy subjects show that the proposed model improves the quality of images compared with the state of the art. In addition, the evaluation of E-GAN and the state of art methods gives a better result on the structural information (13.73% improvement for PSNR and 22.95% for SSIM compared to Pix2Pix GAN) and textural information (6.9% improvements for homogeneity error in Haralick features compared to Pix2Pix GAN).

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: The cortical uptake of tau positron emission tomography (PET) tracers corresponds to the Braak stage and reflects the distribution and progression of tau neurofibrillary tangles. The present study aimed to develop and validate the basic performance of a novel tau PET phantom, as well as to establish standard test procedures and analytical methods.

Methods: The tau PET phantom consisted of a brain simulation section simulated medial temporal lobe region and resolution and uniformity sections. The brain simulation section and hot rods and uniformity section contained 4 and 2 kBq/mL of18F, respectively and images were acquired three times for 20 min with a PET/CT scanner. The resolution section was visually assessed with two sets of hot and cold rods. Recovery coefficients (RCs) as a quantitative value and coefficient of variation (CV) as image noise were determined based on the brain simulation and the uniformity section, respectively.

Results: Preparation of activity in the phantom was repeatable among three measurements. The quality of images in the brain simulation and uniformity section with the rods was good. The 5- or 6-mm rods were detected separately. The mean RCs calculated based on the VOI template were between 0.75 and 0.83. The CV at the center slice of uniformity section was 5.54%.

Conclusions: We developed a novel tau PET phantom to assess quantitative value, image noise, and detectability and resolution from brain simulation section, uniformity section, and rods, respectively. This phantom will contribute to the standardization and harmonization of tau PET imaging.

TITLE: Low activity [11C]raclopride kinetic modeling in the mouse brain using the spatiotemporal kernel method

AUTHORS: Alan Miranda, Daniele Bertoglio, Sigrid Stroobants, Steven Staelens, Jeroen Verhaeghe

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Depending on the molar activity of the tracer, the maximal allowable injected activity in mouse brain PET studies can be extremely low in order to avoid receptor saturation. Therefore, a high level of noise can be present in the image. We investigate several dynamic PET reconstruction methods in reduced counts, or equivalently in reduced injected activity, data exemplified in [11C]racloprideBPNDandR1quantification using the simplified reference tissue model (SRTM). We compared independent frame reconstruction (IFR), post-reconstruction HYPR denoising (IFR + HYPR), direct reconstruction using the SRTM model (DIR-SRTM), and the spatial (KERS) and spatiotemporal kernel reconstruction (KERST). Additionally, HYPR denoising of the frames used as features for the calculation of the spatial kernel matrix, was investigated (KERS-HYPR and KERST-HYPR).In vivodata of 11 mice, was used to generate list-mode data for five reduced count levels corresponding to reductions by a factor 4, 8, 12, 16 and 32 (equivalently 2.07, 1.04, 0.691, 0.518, and 0.260 MBq). Correlation of regionalBPNDandR1values (reduced versus full counts reconstructions) was high (r > 0.94) for all methods, with KERS-HYPR and KERST-HYPR reaching the highest correlation (r> 0.96). Among methods with regularization, DIR-SRTM showed the largest variability inBPND(Bland-Altman SD from 3.0% to 12%), while IFR showed it forR1(5.1%-14.6%). KERST and KERST-HYPR were the only methods with Bland-Altman bias and SD below 5% for noise level up to a reduction factor of 16. At the voxel level,BPNDandR1correlation was gradually decreased with increasing noise, with the largest correlation (BPNDr> 0.88,R1r> 0.62) for KERS-HYPR and KERST-HYPR. The spatial and the spatiotemporal kernel methods performed similarly, while using only temporal regularization with direct reconstruction showed more variability. AlthoughR1 values present noise, using the spatiotemporal kernel reconstruction, accurate estimates of binding potential could be obtained with mouse injected activities as low as 0.26-0.518 MBq. This is desirable in order to maintain the tracer kinetics principle in mouse studies.

TITLE: Supplemental Transmission Aided Attenuation Correction for Quantitative Cardiac PET

AUTHORS: Mi-Ae Park, Vlad G Zaha, Ramsey D Badawi, Spencer L Bowen

JOURNAL: IEEE transactions on medical imaging

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Quantitative PET attenuation correction (AC) for cardiac PET/CT and PET/MR is a challenging problem. We propose and evaluate an AC approach that uses coincidences from a relatively weak and physically fixed sparse external source, in combination with that from the patient, to reconstruct μ -maps based on physics principles alone. The low 30 cm3 volume of the source makes it easy to fill and place, and the method does not use prior image data or attenuation map assumptions. Our supplemental transmission aided maximum likelihood reconstruction of attenuation and activity (sTX-MLAA) algorithm contains an attenuation map update that maximizes the likelihood of terms representing coincidences originating from tracer in the patient and a weighted expression of counts segmented from the external source alone. Both external source and patient scatter and randoms are fully corrected. We evaluated performance of sTX-MLAA compared to reference standard CT-based AC with FDG PET/CT phantom studies; including modeling a patient with myocardial inflammation. Through an ROI analysis we measured ≤ 5 % bias in activity concentrations for PET images generated with sTX-MLAA and a TX source strength ≥ 12.7 MBq, relative to CT-AC. PET background variability (from noise and sparse sampling) was substantially reduced with sTX-MLAA compared to using counts segmented from the transmission source alone for AC. Results suggest that sTX-MLAA will enable quantitative PET during cardiac PET/CT and PET/MR of human patients.

TITLE: Intra-scanner repeatability of quantitative imaging features in a 3D printed semi-anthropomorphic CT phantom

AUTHORS: Hanna Muenzfeld, Claus Nowak, Stefanie Riedlberger, Alexander Hartenstein, Bernd Hamm, Paul Jahnke, Tobias Penzkofer

JOURNAL: European journal of radiology

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Objectives: Radiomics has shown to provide novel diagnostic and predictive disease information based on quantitative image features in study settings. However, limited data yielded contradictory results and important questions regarding the validity of the methods remain to be answered. The purpose of this study was to evaluate how clinical imaging techniques affect the stability of radiomics features by using 3D printed anthropomorphic CT phantom to test for repeatability and reproducibility of quantitative parameters.

Methods: 48 PET/CT validated lymph nodes of prostate cancer patients (24 metastatic, 24 non-metastatic) were used as a template to create a customized 3D printed anthropomorphic phantom. We subsequently scanned the phantom five times with a routine abdominal CT protocol. Images were reconstructed using iterative reconstruction and two soft tissue kernels and one bone kernel. Radiomics features were extracted and assessed for repeatability and susceptibility towards image reconstruction settings using concordance correlation coefficients.

Results: Our analysis revealed 19 of 86 features (22 %) as highly repeatable (CCC ≥ 0.85) with low susceptibility towards image reconstruction protocols. Most features analyzed depicted critical non-repeatability with CCC's < 0.75 even under entirely consistent imaging acquisition settings. Edge enhancing kernels result in higher variances between the scans and differences in repeatability and reproducibility were detected between PSMA-positive and negative lymph nodes with overall more stable features seen in tumor positive lymph nodes.

Conclusions: Both, repeatability and reproducibility play a crucial role in the validation process of radiomics features in clinical routine. This phantom study shows that most radiomics features in contrast to previous studies, including phantom and clinical, do not depict sufficient intra-scanner repeatability to serve as reliable diagnostic tools.

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Objective.In clinical positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, quantification of radiotracer uptake in tumours is often performed using semi-quantitative measurements such as the standardised uptake value (SUV). For small objects, the accuracy of SUV estimates is limited by the noise properties of PET images and the partial volume effect. There is need for methods that provide more accurate and reproducible quantification of radiotracer uptake.Approach.In this work, we present a deep learning approach with the aim of improving quantification of lung tumour radiotracer uptake and tumour shape definition. A set of simulated tumours, assigned with 'ground truth' radiotracer distributions, are used to generate realistic PET raw data which are then reconstructed into PET images. In this work, the ground truth images are generated by placing simulated tumours characterised by different sizes and activity distributions in the left lung of an anthropomorphic phantom. These images are then used as input to an analytical simulator to simulate realistic raw PET data. The PET images reconstructed from the simulated raw data and the corresponding ground truth images are used to train a 3D convolutional neural network.Results.When tested on an unseen set of reconstructed PET phantom images, the network yields improved estimates of the corresponding ground truth. The same network is then applied to reconstructed PET data generated with different point spread functions. Overall the network is able to recover better defined tumour shapes and improved estimates of tumour maximum and median activities.Significance.Our results suggest that the proposed approach, trained on data simulated with one scanner geometry, has the potential to restore PET data acquired with different scanners.

TITLE: Animal PET scanner with a large field of view is suitable for high-throughput scanning of rodents

AUTHORS: Yuki Tomonari, Yuya Onishi, Fumio Hashimoto, Kibo Ote, Takashi Okamoto, Hiroyuki Ohba

JOURNAL: Annals of nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Objective: In preclinical studies, high-throughput positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, known as simultaneous multiple animal scanning, can reduce the time spent on animal experiments, the cost of PET tracers, and the risk of synthesis of PET tracers. It is well known that the image quality acquired by high-throughput imaging depends on the PET system. Herein, we investigated the influence of large field of view (FOV) PET scanner on high-throughput imaging.

Methods: We investigated the influence of scanning four objects using a small animal PET scanner with a large FOV. We compared the image quality acquired by four objects scanned with the one acquired by one object scanned using phantoms and animals. We assessed the image quality with uniformity, recovery coefficient (RC), and spillover ratio (SOR), which are indicators of image noise, spatial resolution, and quantitative precision, respectively. For the phantom study, we used the NEMA NU 4-2008 image quality phantom and evaluated uniformity, RC, and SOR, and for the animal study, we used Wistar rats and evaluated the spillover in the heart and kidney.

Results: In the phantom study, four phantoms had little effect on imaging quality, especially SOR compared with that for one phantom. In the animal study as well, four rats had little effect on spillover from the heart muscle and kidney cortex compared with that for one rat.

Conclusions: This study demonstrated that an animal PET scanner with a large FOV was suitable for high-throughput imaging. Thus, the large FOV PET scanner can support drug discovery and bridging research through rapid pharmacological and pathological evaluation.

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Objective.Head motion correction (MC) is an essential process in brain positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. We have used the Polaris Vicra, an optical hardware-based motion tracking (HMT) device, for PET head MC. However, this requires attachment of a marker to the subject's head. Markerless HMT (MLMT) methods are more convenient for clinical translation than HMT with external markers. In this study, we validated the United Imaging Healthcare motion tracking (UMT) MLMT system using phantom and human point source studies, and tested its effectiveness on eight18F-FPEB and four11C-LSN3172176 human studies, with frame-based region of interest (ROI) analysis. We also proposed an evaluation metric, registration quality (RQ), and compared it to a data-driven evaluation method, motion-corrected centroid-of-distribution (MCCOD).Approach.UMT utilized a stereovision camera with infrared structured light to capture the subject's real-time 3D facial surface. Each point cloud, acquired at up to 30 Hz, was registered to the reference cloud using a rigid-body iterative closest point registration algorithm.Main results.In the phantom point source study, UMT exhibited superior reconstruction results than the Vicra with higher spatial resolution (0.35 ± 0.27 mm) and smaller residual displacements (0.12 ± 0.10 mm). In the human point source study, UMT achieved comparable performance as Vicra on spatial resolution with lower noise. Moreover, UMT achieved comparable ROI values as Vicra for all the human studies, with negligible mean standard uptake value differences, while no MC results showed significant negative bias. TheRQevaluation metric demonstrated the effectiveness of UMT and yielded comparable results to MCCOD.Significance.We performed an initial validation of a commercial MLMT system against the Vicra. Generally, UMT achieved comparable motion-tracking results in all studies and the effectiveness of UMT-based MC was demonstrated.

ABSTRACT:
Methods to shorten [18F]FDG Patlak PET imaging procedures ranging from 65-90 to 20-30 min after injection, using a population-averaged input function (PIF) scaled to patient-specific image-derived input function (IDIF) values, were recently evaluated. The aim of the present study was to explore the feasibility of ultrashort 10-min [18F]FDG Patlak imaging at 55-65 min after injection using a PIF combined with direct Patlak reconstructions to provide reliable quantitative accuracy of lung tumor uptake, compared with a full-duration 65-min acquisition using an IDIF.Methods:Patients underwent a 65-min dynamic PET acquisition on a long-axial-field-of-view (LAFOV) Biograph Vision Quadra PET/CT scanner. Subsequently, direct Patlak reconstructions and image-based (with reconstructed dynamic images) Patlak analyses were performed using both the IDIF (time to relative kinetic equilibrium between blood and tissue concentration (t*) = 30 min) and a scaled PIF at 30-60 min after injection. Next, direct Patlak reconstructions were performed on the system console using only the last 10 min of the acquisition, that is, from 55 to 65 min after injection, and a scaled PIF using maximum crystal ring difference settings of both 85 and 322. Tumor lesion and healthy-tissue uptake was quantified and compared between the differently obtained parametric images to assess quantitative accuracy.Results:Good agreement was obtained between direct- and image-based Patlak analyses using the IDIF (t* = 30 min) and scaled PIF at 30-60 min after injection, performed using the different approaches, with no more than 8.8% deviation in tumor influx rate value () (mean difference ranging from -0.0022 to 0.0018 mL/[min × g]). When direct Patlak reconstruction was performed on the system console, excellent agreement was found between the use of a scaled PIF at 30-60 min after injection versus 55-65 min after injection, with 2.4% deviation in tumor(median difference, -0.0018 mL/[min × g]; range, -0.0047 to 0.0036 mL/[min × g]). For different maximum crystal ring difference settings using the scan time interval of 55-65 min after injection, only a 0.5% difference (median difference, 0.0000 mL/[min × g]; range, -0.0004 to 0.0013 mL/[min × g]) in tumorwas found.Conclusion:Ultrashort whole-body [18F]FDG Patlak imaging is feasible on an LAFOV Biograph Vision Quadra PET/CT system without loss of quantitative accuracy to assess lung tumor uptake compared with a full-duration 65-min acquisition. The ultrashort 10-min direct Patlak reconstruction with PIF allows for its implementation in clinical practice.

ABSTRACT:
Myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) with PET plays a vital role in the management of coronary artery disease. High sensitivity systems can contribute to maximizing the potential value of PET MPI; therefore, we have proposed two novel detector arrangements, an elliptical geometry and a D-shape geometry, that are more sensitive and more compact than a conventional large-bore cylindrical geometry. Here we investigate two items: the benefits of the proposed geometries for cardiac imaging; and the effects of scatter components on cardiac PET image quality. Using the Geant4 toolkit, we modeled four time-of-flight (TOF) PET systems: an 80 cm diameter cylinder, a 40 cm diameter cylinder, a compact ellipse, and a compact D-shape. Spatial resolution and sensitivity were measured using point sources. Noise equivalent count rate and image quality were examined using an anthropomorphic digital chest phantom. The proposed geometries showed higher sensitivity and better count rate characteristics with a fewer number of detectors than the conventional large-bore cylindrical geometry. In addition, we found that the increased intensity of the scatter components was a big factor affecting the contrast in defect regions for such a compact geometry. It is important to address the issue of the increased intensity of the scatter components to develop a high-performance compact cardiac TOF PET system.

TITLE: DSG-GAN:A dual-stage-generator-based GAN for cross-modality synthesis from PET to CT

AUTHORS: Huabin Wang, Xiangdong Wang, Fei Liu, Grace Zhang, Gong Zhang, Qiang Zhang, Michael L Lang

JOURNAL: Computers in biology and medicine

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
PET/CT devices typically use CT images for PET attenuation correction, leading to additional radiation exposure. Alternatively, in a standalone PET imaging system, attenuation and scatter correction cannot be performed due to the absence of CT images. Therefore, it is necessary to explore methods for generating pseudo-CT images from PET images. However, traditional PET-to-CT synthesis models encounter conflicts in multi-objective optimization, leading to disparities between synthetic and real images in overall structure and texture. To address this issue, we propose a staged image generation model. Firstly, we construct a dual-stage generator, which synthesizes the overall structure and texture details of images by decomposing optimization objectives and employing multiple loss functions constraints. Additionally, in each generator, we employ improved deep perceptual skip connections, which utilize cross-layer information interaction and deep perceptual selection to effectively and selectively leverage multi-level deep information and avoid interference from redundant information. Finally, we construct a context-aware local discriminator, which integrates context information and extracts local features to generate fine local details of images and reasonably maintain the overall coherence of the images. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms other methods, with SSIM, PSNR, and FID metrics reaching 0.8993, 29.6108, and 29.7489, respectively, achieving the state-of-the-art. Furthermore, we conduct visual experiments on the synthesized pseudo-CT images in terms of image structure and texture. The results indicate that the pseudo-CT images synthesized in this study are more similar to real CT images, providing accurate structure information for clinical disease analysis and lesion localization.

TITLE: Stability of radiomic features from positron emission tomography images: a phantom study comparing advanced reconstruction algorithms and ordered subset expectation maximization

AUTHORS: Takuro Shiiba, Masanori Watanabe

JOURNAL: Physical and engineering sciences in medicine

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
In this study, we compared the repeatability and reproducibility of radiomic features obtained from positron emission tomography (PET) images according to the reconstruction algorithm used-advanced reconstruction algorithms, such as HYPER iterative (IT), HYPER deep learning reconstruction (DLR), and HYPER deep progressive reconstruction (DPR), or traditional Ordered Subset Expectation Maximization (OSEM)-to understand the potential variations and implications of using advanced reconstruction techniques in PET-based radiomics. We used a heterogeneous phantom with acrylic spherical beads (4- or 8-mm diameter) filled with18F. PET images were acquired and reconstructed using OSEM, IT, DLR, and DPR. Original and wavelet radiomic features were calculated using SlicerRadiomics. Radiomic feature repeatability was assessed using the Coefficient of Variance (COV) and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), and inter-acquisition time reproducibility was assessed using the concordance correlation coefficient (CCC). For the 4- and 8-mm diameter beads phantom, the proportion of radiomic features with a COV < 10% was equivocal or higher for the advanced reconstruction algorithm than for OSEM. ICC indicated that advanced methods generally outperformed OSEM in repeatability, except for the original features of the 8-mm beads phantom. In the inter-acquisition time reproducibility analysis, the combinations of 3 and 5 min exhibited the highest reproducibility in both phantoms, with IT and DPR showing the highest proportion of radiomic features with CCC > 0.8. Advanced reconstruction methods provided enhanced stability of radiomic features compared with OSEM, suggesting their potential for optimal image reconstruction in PET-based radiomics, offering potential benefits in clinical diagnostics and prognostics.

TITLE: The SNR of time-of-flight positron emission tomography data for joint reconstruction of the activity and attenuation images

AUTHORS: Johan Nuyts, Michel Defrise, Christian Morel, Paul Lecoq

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Objective.Measurement of the time-of-flight (TOF) difference of each coincident pair of photons increases the effective sensitivity of positron emission tomography (PET). Many authors have analyzed the benefit of TOF for quantification and hot spot detection in the reconstructed activity images. However, TOF not only improves the effective sensitivity, it also enables the joint reconstruction of the tracer concentration and attenuation images. This can be used to correct for errors in CT- or MR-derived attenuation maps, or to apply attenuation correction without the help of a second modality. This paper presents an analysis of the effect of TOF on the variance of the jointly reconstructed attenuation and (attenuation corrected) tracer concentration images.Approach.The analysis is performed for PET systems that have a distribution of possibly non-Gaussian TOF-kernels, and includes the conventional Gaussian TOF-kernel as a special case. Non-Gaussian TOF-kernels are often observed in novel detector designs, which make use of two (or more) different mechanisms to convert the incoming 511 keV photon to optical photons. The analytical result is validated with a simple 2D simulation.Main results.We show that if two different TOF-kernels are equivalent for image reconstruction with known attenuation, then they are also equivalent for joint reconstruction of the activity and the attenuation images. The variance increase in the activity, caused by also jointly reconstructing the attenuation image, vanishes when the TOF-resolution approaches perfection.Significance.These results are of interest for PET detector development and for the development of stand-alone PET systems.

TITLE: Explainable AI for automated respiratory misalignment detection in PET/CT imaging

AUTHORS: Yazdan Salimi, Zahra Mansouri, Mehdi Amini, Ismini Mainta, Habib Zaidi

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Purpose.Positron emission tomography (PET) image quality can be affected by artifacts emanating from PET, computed tomography (CT), or artifacts due to misalignment between PET and CT images. Automated detection of misalignment artifacts can be helpful both in data curation and in facilitating clinical workflow. This study aimed to develop an explainable machine learning approach to detect misalignment artifacts in PET/CT imaging.Approach.This study included 1216 PET/CT images. All images were visualized and images with respiratory misalignment artifact (RMA) detected. Using previously trained models, four organs including the lungs, liver, spleen, and heart were delineated on PET and CT images separately. Data were randomly split into cross-validation (80%) and test set (20%), then two segmentations performed on PET and CT images were compared and the comparison metrics used as predictors for a random forest framework in a 10-fold scheme on cross-validation data. The trained models were tested on 20% test set data. The model's performance was calculated in terms of specificity, sensitivity, F1-Score and area under the curve (AUC).Main results.Sensitivity, specificity, and AUC of 0.82, 0.85, and 0.91 were achieved in ten-fold data split. F1_score, sensitivity, specificity, and AUC of 84.5 vs 82.3, 83.9 vs 83.8, 87.7 vs 83.5, and 93.2 vs 90.1 were achieved for cross-validation vs test set, respectively. The liver and lung were the most important organs selected after feature selection.Significance.We developed an automated pipeline to segment four organs from PET and CT images separately and used the match between these segmentations to decide about the presence of misalignment artifact. This methodology may follow the same logic as a reader detecting misalignment through comparing the contours of organs on PET and CT images. The proposed method can be used to clean large datasets or integrated into a clinical scanner to indicate artifactual cases.

TITLE: On the implementation of acollinearity in PET Monte Carlo simulations

AUTHORS: Maxime Toussaint, Francis Loignon-Houle, Étienne Auger, Gabriel Lapointe, Jean-Pierre Dussault, Roger Lecomte

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Objective.Acollinearity of annihilation photons (APA) introduces spatial blur in positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. This phenomenon increases proportionally with the scanner diameter and it has been shown to follow a Gaussian distribution. This last statement can be interpreted in two ways: the magnitude of the acollinearity angle, or the angular deviation of annihilation photons from perfect collinearity. As the former constitutes the partial integral of the latter, a misinterpretation could have significant consequences on the resulting spatial blurring. Previous research investigating the impact of APA in PET imaging has assumed the Gaussian nature of its angular deviation, which is consistent with experimental results. However, a comprehensive analysis of several simulation software packages for PET data acquisition revealed that the magnitude of APA was implemented as a Gaussian distribution.Approach.We quantified the impact of this misinterpretation of APA by comparing simulations obtained with GATE, which is one of these simulation programs, to an in-house modification of GATE that models APA deviation as following a Gaussian distribution.Main results.We show that the APA misinterpretation not only alters the spatial blurring profile in image space, but also considerably underestimates the impact of APA on spatial resolution. For an ideal PET scanner with a diameter of 81 cm, the APA point source response simulated under the first interpretation has a cusp shape with 0.4 mm FWHM. This is significantly different from the expected Gaussian point source response of 2.1 mm FWHM reproduced under the second interpretation.Significance.Although this misinterpretation has been found in several PET simulation tools, it has had a limited impact on the simulated spatial resolution of current PET scanners due to its small magnitude relative to the other factors. However, the inaccuracy it introduces in estimating the overall spatial resolution of PET scanners will increase as the performance of newer devices improves.

ABSTRACT:
It is a growing concern that outcomes of neuroimaging studies often cannot be replicated. To counteract this, the magnetic resonance (MR) neuroimaging community has promoted acquisition standards and created data sharing platforms, based on a consensus on how to organize and share MR neuroimaging data. Here, we take a similar approach to positron emission tomography (PET) data. To facilitate comparison of findings across studies, we first recommend publication standards for tracer characteristics, image acquisition, image preprocessing, and outcome estimation for PET neuroimaging data. The co-authors of this paper, representing more than 25 PET centers worldwide, voted to classify information as mandatory, recommended, or optional. Second, we describe a framework to facilitate data archiving and data sharing within and across centers. Because of the high cost of PET neuroimaging studies, sample sizes tend to be small and relatively few sites worldwide have the required multidisciplinary expertise to properly conduct and analyze PET studies. Data sharing will make it easier to combine datasets from different centers to achieve larger sample sizes and stronger statistical power to test hypotheses. The combining of datasets from different centers may be enhanced by adoption of a common set of best practices in data acquisition and analysis.

TITLE: Usefulness of a new anthropomorphic phantom simulating the chest and abdomen regions in PET tests

AUTHORS: Hiroaki Sagara, Kazumasa Inoue, Chikara Mano, Hironori Kajiwara, Yuichi Nagai, Hirofumi Fujii, Anri Inaki

JOURNAL: Annals of nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Objective: To investigate the clinical utility of a new anthropomorphic phantom that reproduces the chest and abdomen better than the conventional National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) body phantom, count rates and image quality of PET images obtained from patients were evaluated.

Methods: Anthropomorphic phantoms were used to include radioactivity in the lung, liver, kidney, and background regions. Two NEMA body phantoms were used for chest and abdominal assessments. The cross calibration factor (CCF) cylinder phantom was also used to reproduce the distribution of radioactivity outside the field of view, simulating the patient brain. Four types of phantoms were used in the PET imaging experiment, and for each phantom, the prompt coincidence count rates, random coincidence count rates, true + scatter coincidence count rates, and single photon count rates were measured. Then, these count rates were compared with count rates from actual clinical data. PET image quality assessment was done using the parameters, noise equivalent count patient (NECpatient), noise equivalent count density (NECdensity), and liver signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).

Results: Random coincidence count rates showed that the data obtained from each phantom were in good agreement with the clinical data. True + scatter coincidence count rates had better agreement with clinical data when measured for anthropomorphic phantoms than for the NEMA body phantoms. Furthermore, when the CCF Cylinder phantom simulating the brain was placed outside the imaging field of view, the results were closer to the clinical data. PET image quality was 1.4% higher for NECpatientobtained from anthropomorphic phantoms compared to the mean obtained from clinical data. NECdensitywas 15.0% lower than the mean value obtained from clinical data. Liver SNR was 14.8% higher in PET images reconstructed using the 3D-ordered subsets expectation maximization (OSEM) method. It was 10.0% lower in PET images reconstructed with the image reconstruction method Q.Clear (GE Healthcare) using the Bayesian penalized likelihood (BPL) method.

Conclusion: The new anthropomorphic phantom was more consistent with the count rates obtained from clinical data than the conventional NEMA body phantoms were and it was able to better simulate the distribution of radioactivity concentrations in the patients by reproducing the distribution of radioactivity concentrations outside the field of view.

TITLE: Artificial intelligence for tumor [18F]FDG-PET imaging: Advancement and future trends-part I

AUTHORS: Alireza Safarian, Seyed Ali Mirshahvalad, Abolfazl Farbod, Hadi Nasrollahi, Christian Pirich, Mohsen Beheshti

JOURNAL: Seminars in nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
The advent of sophisticated image analysis techniques has facilitated the extraction of increasingly complex data, such as radiomic features, from various imaging modalities, including [18F]FDG PET/CT, a well-established cornerstone of oncological imaging. Furthermore, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms has shown considerable promise in enhancing the interpretation of these quantitative parameters. Additionally, AI-driven models enable the integration of parameters from multiple imaging modalities along with clinical data, facilitating the development of comprehensive models with significant clinical impact. However, challenges remain regarding standardization and validation of the AI-powered models, as well as their implementation in real-world clinical practice. The variability in imaging acquisition protocols, segmentation methods, and feature extraction approaches across different institutions necessitates robust harmonization efforts to ensure reproducibility and clinical utility. Moreover, the successful translation of AI models into clinical practice requires prospective validation in large cohorts, as well as seamless integration into existing workflows to assess their ability to enhance clinicians' performance. This review aims to provide an overview of the literature and highlight three key applications: diagnostic impact, prediction of treatment response, and long-term patient prognostication. In the first part, we will focus on head and neck, lung, breast, gastroesophageal, colorectal, and gynecological malignancies.

TITLE: Fast γ Photon Imaging for Inner Surface Defects Detecting

AUTHORS: Min Yao, Guangdong Luo, Min Zhao, Ruipeng Guo, Jian Liu

JOURNAL: Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Only a few effective methods can detect internal defects and monitor the internal state of complex structural parts. On the basis of the principle of PET (positron emission computed tomography), a new measurement method, using γ photon to detect defects of an inner surface, is proposed. This method has the characteristics of strong penetration, anti-corrosion and anti-interference. With the aim of improving detection accuracy and imaging speed, this study also proposes image reconstruction algorithms, combining the classic FBP (filtered back projection) with MLEM (maximum likelihood expectation Maximization) algorithm. The proposed scheme can reduce the number of iterations required, when imaging, to achieve the same image quality. According to the operational demands of FPGAs (field-programmable gate array), a BPML (back projection maximum likelihood) algorithm is adapted to the structural characteristics of an FPGA, which makes it feasible to test the proposed algorithms therein. Furthermore, edge detection and defect recognition are conducted after reconstructing the inner image. The effectiveness and superiority of the algorithm are verified, and the performance of the FPGA is evaluated by the experiments.

TITLE: Influence of different time framings, reconstruction algorithms and post-processing methods on the quantification of myocardial blood flow from 13 N-NH3 PET images

AUTHORS: Shahnaz Akil, Anna E Székely, Fredrik Hedeer, Berit Olsson, Henrik Engblom, Cecilia Hindorf

JOURNAL: Clinical physiology and functional imaging

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Background: The aim was to investigate to what extent the quantification of myocardial blood flow (MBF) from dynamic13N-NH3positron emission tomography (PET) images is affected by time frame schemes, time-of-flight (ToF), reconstruction algorithms, blood pool volume of interest (VOI) locations and compartment models in patients with suspected chronic coronary syndrome.

Methods: A standard MBF value was determined from 25 patients' rest/stress13N-NH3PET/CT images reconstructed with ordered subset expectation maximization (OSEM), 5 s time frame for the first frames without ToF, subsequently analyzed using a basal VOI and the deGrado compartment model. MBFs calculated using 2 or 10 s for the first frames, ToF, block-sequential regularized expectation maximization (BSREM), apical or large VOI, Hutchins or Krivokapich compartment models were compared to MBFstandardin Bland-Altman plots (bias ± SD).

Results: Good agreement in global rest/stress MBF (mL/min/g) was found when changing the time frame scheme or reconstruction algorithm (MBFstandardvs. MBF2s: -0.02 ± 0.06; MBF10s: 0.01 ± 0.07; MBFBSREM: 0.01 ± 0.07), while a lower level of agreement was found when altering the other factors (MBFstandardvs. MBFToF: -0.07 ± 0.10; MBFapical VOI: -0.27 ± 0.25; MBFlarge VOI: -0.11 ± 0.10; MBFHutchins: -0.08 ± 0.10; MBFKrivokapich: -0.47 ± 0.50).

Conclusions: Quantification of MBF from13N-NH3PET images is more affected by choice of compartment models, ToF and blood pool VOIs than by different time frame schemes and reconstruction algorithms.

ABSTRACT:
Positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) has improved sensitivity and resolution using silicon photomultiplier as a photosensor. Previously, only a fixed setting was available for the shooting time of 1 bed, but now, the shooting time can be changed for each bed. Time can be shortened or extended depending on the target area. A few studies reported on image reconstruction conditions for head and neck cancer in whole-body PET/CT examinations. Thus, this study aimed to optimize the imaging conditions of the head and neck region during whole-body imaging. A cylindrical acrylic container with a 200 mm diameter was used to simulate the head and neck area using a PET/CT system equipped with a semiconductor detector. Spheres of 6-30 mm in diameter were enclosed in the 200 mm diameter cylindrical acrylic vessel. Radioactivity in 18F solution (Hot:BG ratio 4:1) was enclosed in a phantom following the Japanese Society of Nuclear Medicine (JSNM) guidelines. Background radioactivity concentration was 2.53 kBq/mL. List mode acquisition of 1,800 s was collected at 60-1,800 s with the field of view of 700 mm and 350 mm. The image was reconstructed by resizing the matrix to 128 × 128, 192 × 192, 256 × 256, and 384 × 384, respectively. The imaging time per bed in the head and neck should be at least 180 s, and the reconstruction conditions should be a field of view (FOV) of 350 mm, matrix sizes of ≥ 192, and a Bayesian penalized likelihood (BPL) reconstruction with a β-value of 200. This allows detection of > 70% of the 8-mm spheres in the images.

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Multimodality imaging has emerged from a vision thirty years ago to routine clinical use today. Positron emission tomography (PET)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is still relatively new in this arena and particularly suitable for clinical research and technical development. PET/MRI-guidance for interventions opens up opportunities for novel treatments but at the same time demands certain technical and organizational requirements to be fulfilled. In this work, we aimed to demonstrate a practical setting and potential application of PET/MRI guidance of interventional procedures. The superior quantitative physiologic information of PET, the various unique imaging characteristics of MRI, and the reduced radiation exposure are the most relevant advantages of this technique. As a noninvasive interventional tool, focused ultrasound (FUS) ablation of tumor cells would benefit from PET/MRI for diagnostics, treatment planning and intervention. Yet, technical limitations might impeed preclinical research, given that PET/MRI sites are per se not designed as interventional suites. Nonetheless, several approaches have been offered in the past years to upgrade MRI suites for interventional purposes. Taking advantage of state of the art and easy-to-use technology it is possible to create a supporting infrastructure that is suitable for broad preclinical adaption. Several aspects are to be addressed, including remote control of the imaging system, display of the imaging results, communication technology, and implementation of additional devices such as a FUS platform and an MR-compatible robotic system for positioning of the FUS equipment. Feasibility could be demostrated with an examplary experimental setup for interventional PET/MRI. Most PET/MRI sites could allow for interventions with just a few add-ons and modifications, such as comunication, in room image display and sytems control. By unlocking this feature, and driving preclinical research in interventional PET/MRI, translation of the protocol and methodology into clinical settings seems feasible.

TITLE: Evaluation of improved attenuation correction in whole-body PET/MR on patients with bone metastasis using various radiotracers

AUTHORS: Hong Grafe, Maike E Lindemann, Verena Ruhlmann, Mark Oehmigen, Nader Hirmas, Lale Umutlu, Ken Herrmann, Harald H Quick

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: This study evaluates the quantitative effect of improved MR-based attenuation correction (AC), including bone segmentation and the HUGE method for truncation correction in PET/MR whole-body hybrid imaging specifically of oncologic patients with bone metastasis and using various radiotracers.

Methods: Twenty-three patients that underwent altogether 28 whole-body PET/MR examinations with findings of bone metastasis were included in this study. Different radiotracers (18F-FDG,68Ga-PSMA,68Ga-DOTATOC,124I-MIBG) were injected according to appropriate clinical indications. Each of the 28 whole-body PET datasets was reconstructed three times using AC with (1) standard four-compartment μ-maps (background air, lung, muscle, and soft tissue), (2) five-compartment μ-maps (adding bone), and (3) six-compartment μ-maps (adding bone and HUGE truncation correction). The SUVmaxof each detected bone lesion was measured in each reconstruction to evaluate the quantitative impact of improved MR-based AC. Relative difference images between four- and six-compartment μ-maps were calculated. MR-based HUGE truncation correction was compared with the PET-based MLAA truncation correction method in all patients.

Results: Overall, 69 bone lesions were detected and evaluated. The mean increase in relative difference over all 69 lesions in SUVmaxwas 5.4 ± 6.4% when comparing the improved six-compartment AC with the standard four-compartment AC. Maximal relative difference of 28.4% was measured in one lesion. Truncation correction with HUGE worked robust and resulted in realistic body contouring in all 28 exams and for all 4 different radiotracers. Truncation correction with MLAA revealed overestimations of arm tissue volume in all PET/MR exams with18F-FDG radiotracer and failed in all other exams with radiotracers68Ga-PSMA,68Ga-DOTATOC, and124I- MIBG due to limitations in body contour detection.

Conclusion: Improved MR-based AC, including bone segmentation and HUGE truncation correction in whole-body PET/MR on patients with bone lesions and using various radiotracers, is important to ensure best possible diagnostic image quality and accurate PET quantification. The HUGE method for truncation correction based on MR worked robust and results in realistic body contouring, independent of the radiotracers used.

ABSTRACT:
Accurate localization of the epileptic lesion is crucial for surgical management of patients with epilepsy. However, detection rate of epileptic lesion with routine MRI imaging is limited. This study aims to investigate whether image-level and feature-level fusion of [18F]FDG PET and MR images using radiomics features would improve the detection of epileptic lesion. Forty-six drug refractory epilepsy patients with temporal and extra-temporal lesions who had PET/MRI exams for pre-surgical evaluation and follow-up MRI scans for post-surgical evaluation were included in this study, as well as 33 healthy controls who had PET/MRI exams. Radiomics features were extracted from high-resolution MRI, FDG PET, and fused images separately and combined. Image-level and feature-level fusions were applied to systematically search for optimal feature combination, which were then fed into the logistic regression models for performance evaluation. Models based on features extracted from fused images using Discrete Wavelet Transform showed better performance (top AUC = 0.871) with smaller feature counts, compared with those based on FDG PET alone (AUC = 0.838) or MRI alone (AUC = 0.763). Concatenated features using fused images together with original modalities further improved model performance, with the best model reaching AUC of 0.908.Our study suggests that multi-level fusion of FDG PET and T1w-MRI with radiomics feature extraction holds great potential in automated epileptic lesion detection with much higher performance over single modalities.Clinical Relevance- This study reveals that multi-level fusion of FDG PET and MRI with radiomics has potential to achieve automated epileptic lesion detection with much higher accuracy, potentially improving surgical outcomes.

The signal-to-noise ratio in the liver (SNR liver) is commonly used to assess the quality of positron emission tomography (PET) images; however, it is weakly correlated with visual assessments. Conversely, the noise equivalent count (NEC) density showed a strong correlation with visual assessment but did not consider the effects of image reconstruction conditions. Therefore, we propose a new indicator, the modified SNR liver, and plan to verify its usefulness by comparing it with conventional indicators. We retrospectively analyzed 103 patients who underwent whole-body PET/computed tomography (CT). Approximately 60 min after the intravenous injection of18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), the participants were scanned for 2 min/bed. The SNR liver and NEC density were calculated according to the Japanese guidelines for oncology FDG-PET/CT. The modified SNR live was calculated by multiplying the background-to-lung activity ratio by the SNR liver. Patients were classified into groups based on body mass index (BMI) and visual scores. Subsequently, the relationships between these physical indicators, BMI, and visual scores were evaluated. Although the relationship between the modified SNR liver and BMI was inferior to that of NEC density and BMI, the modified SNR liver distinguished the BMI groups more clearly than the conventional SNR liver. Additionally, the modified SNR liver distinguished low visual scores from high scores more accurately than the conventional SNR liver and NEC density. Whether the modified SNR liver is more suitable than the NEC density remains equivocal; however, the modified SNR liver may be superior to the conventional SNR liver for image-quality assessment.

TITLE: The use of weather nowcasting convolutional neural network extrapolators in cardiac PET imaging

AUTHORS: Scott Sloka

JOURNAL: Journal of medical radiation sciences

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Introduction: Algorithms to predict short-term changes in local weather modalities have been used in meteorology for many years. These algorithms predict the temporospatial change in the movement of weather patterns such as cloud cover or precipitation. This paper extends convolutional neural network models for weather prediction/nowcasting to predict evolution in the extrapolation of sequentially acquired count data seen with cardiac positron tomography (PET) data to expected value temporally rather than spatially.

Methods: Six different algorithms used for nowcasting were modified and applied to confirm the approach. These algorithms were trained on an image data set of both simulated ellipsoids and simulated cardiac PET data. The peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity (SSIM) were calculated for each of these trained models. They were compared to the BM3D denoising algorithm as a baseline comparison to a standard method of image denoising.

Results: Most of the implemented algorithms showed a significant improvement in both PSNR and SSIM when compared with the baseline standard, especially when the algorithms were implemented in combination. The best results were obtained with a combination of the ConvLSTM and TrajGRU algorithms with a PSNR improvement over the standard of 5 and more than double the SSIM metric.

Conclusion: This approach of using serially acquired count data to extrapolate a future expected representation through convolutional neural networks has been shown to produce accurate representations of the expected value when compared with a baseline analytic methodology. This paper confirms that algorithms such as these can be used to substantially improve image estimation and shows significant improvement over a baseline standard.

TITLE: Effect of depth of interaction resolution on the spatial resolution of SIAT aPET

AUTHORS: Zhonghua Kuang, Ling Zhang, Ning Ren, Samuel M Kinyanjui, Zheng Liu, Tao Sun, Zhanli Hu, Yongfeng Yang

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Objective.Spatial resolution is a crucial parameter for a positron emission tomography (PET) scanner. The spatial resolution of a high-resolution small animal PET scanner is significantly influenced by the effect of depth of interaction (DOI) uncertainty. The aim of this work is to investigate the impact of DOI resolution on the spatial resolution of a small animal PET scanner called SIAT aPET and determine the required DOI resolution to achieve nearly uniform spatial resolution within the field of view (FOV).Approach. The SIAT aPET detectors utilize 1.0 × 1.0 × 20 mm3crystals, with an average DOI resolution of ∼2 mm. A default number of 16 DOI bins are used during data acquisition. First, a Na-22 point source was scanned in the center of the axial FOV with different radial offsets. Then, a Derenzo phantom was scanned at radial offsets of 0 and 15 mm in the center axial FOV. The measured DOI information was rebinned to 1, 2, 4 and 8 DOI bins to mimic different DOI resolutions of the detectors during image reconstruction.Main results. Significant artifacts were observed in images obtained from both the point source and Derenzo phantom when using only one DOI bin. When accurate measurement of DOI is not achieved, degradation in spatial resolution is more pronounced in the radial direction compared to tangential and axial directions for large radial offsets. The radial spatial resolutions at a 30 mm radial offset are 5.05, 2.62, 1.24, 0.86 and 0.78 mm when using 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16 DOI bins, respectively. The axial spatial resolution improved from ∼1.3 to 0.7 mm as the number of DOI bins increased from 1 to 16 at radial offsets from 0 to 25 mm. Two DOI bins are required to obtain images without significant artifacts. The required DOI resolution is about three times the crystal width of SIAT aPET to achieve a uniform submillimeter spatial resolution within the central 60 mm FOV and resolve the 1 mm rods of the Derenzo phantom at both positions.

TITLE: Evaluating attenuation correction strategies in a dedicated, single-gantry breast PET-tomosynthesis scanner

AUTHORS: Srilalan Krishnamoorthy, Trevor Vent, Bruno Barufaldi, Andrew D A Maidment, Joel S Karp, Suleman Surti

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
We are developing a dedicated, combined breast positron emission tomography (PET)-tomosynthesis scanner. Both the PET and digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) scanners are integrated in a single gantry to provide spatially co-registered 3D PET-tomosynthesis images. The DBT image will be used to identify the breast boundary and breast density to improve the quantitative accuracy of the PET image. This paper explores PET attenuation correction (AC) strategies that can be performed with the combined breast PET-DBT scanner to obtain more accurate, quantitative high-resolution 3D PET images. The PET detector is comprised of a 32 × 32 array of 1.5 × 1.5 × 15 mm3LYSO crystals. The PET scanner utilizes two detector heads separated by either 9 or 11 cm, with each detector head having a 4 × 2 arrangement of PET detectors. GEANT4 Application for Tomographic Emission simulations were performed using an anthropomorphic breast phantom with heterogeneous attenuation under clinical DBT-compression. FDG-avid lesions, each 5 mm in diameter with 8:1 uptake, were simulated at four locations within the breast. Simulations were performed with a scan time of 2 min. PET AC was performed using the actual breast simulation model as well as DBT reconstructed volumetric images to derive the breast outline. In addition to using the known breast density as defined by the breast model, we also modeled it as uniform patient-independent soft-tissue, and as a uniform patient-specific material derived from breast tissue composition. Measured absolute lesion uptake was used to evaluate the quantitative accuracy of performing AC using the various strategies. This study demonstrates that AC is necessary to obtain a closer estimate of the true lesion uptake and background activity in the breast. The DBT image dataset assists in measuring lesion uptake with low bias by facilitating accurate breast delineation as well as providing accurate information related to the breast tissue composition. While both the uniform soft-tissue and patient-specific material approaches provides a close estimate to the ground truth, <5% bias can be achieved by using a uniform patient-specific material to define the attenuation map.

TITLE: Depth-encoding using optical photon TOF in a prism-PET detector with tapered crystals

AUTHORS: Xinjie Zeng, Andy LaBella, Zipai Wang, Yixin Li, Wanbin Tan, Amir H Goldan

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Background: High-resolution brain positron emission tomography (PET) scanner is emerging as a significant and transformative non-invasive neuroimaging tool to advance neuroscience research as well as improve diagnosis and treatment in neurology and psychiatry. Time-of-flight (TOF) and depth-of-interaction (DOI) information provide markedly higher PET imaging performance by increasing image signal-to-noise ratio and mitigating spatial resolution degradation due to parallax error, respectively. PET detector modules that utilize light sharing can inherently carry DOI information from the multiple timestamps that are generated per gamma event. The difference between two timestamps that are triggered by scintillation photons traveling in opposite directions signifies the event's depth-dependent optical photon TOF (oTOF). However, light leak at the crystal-readout interface substantially degrades the resolution of this oTOF-based depth encoding.

Purpose: We demonstrate the feasibility of oTOF-based depth encoding by mitigating light leak in single-ended-readout Prism-PET detector modules using tapered crystals. Minimizing light leak also improved both energy-based DOI and coincidence timing resolutions.

Methods: The tapered Prism-PET module consists of a 1616 array of 1.51.520lutetium yttrium oxyorthosillicate (LYSO) crystals, which are tapered down to 1.21.2at the crystal-readout interface. The LYSO array couples 4-to-1 to an 88 array of 33silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) pixels on the tapered end and to a segmented prismatoid light guide array on the opposite end. Performance of tapered and non-tapered Prism-PET detectors was experimentally characterized and evaluated by measuring flood histogram, energy resolution, energy-, and oTOF-based DOI resolutions, and coincidence timing resolution. Sensitivities of scanners using different Prism-PET detector designs were simulated using Geant4 application for tomographic emission (GATE).

Results: For the tapered (non-tapered) Prism-PET module, the measured full width at half maximum (FWHM) energy, timing, energy-based DOI, and oTOF-based DOI resolutions were 8.88 (11.18)%, 243 (286) ps, 2.35 (3.18) mm, and 5.42 (13.87) mm, respectively. The scanner sensitivities using non-tapered and tapered crystals, and 10 rings of detector modules, were simulated to be 30.9 and 29.5 kcps/MBq, respectively.

Conclusions: The tapered Prism-PET module with minimized light leak enabled the first experimental report of oTOF-based depth encoding at the detector module level. It also enabled the utilization of thinner (i.e., 0.1 mm) inter-crystal spacing with barium sulfate as the reflector while also improving energy-based DOI and timing resolutions.

TITLE: Neural blind deconvolution for deblurring and supersampling PSMA PET

AUTHORS: Caleb Sample, Arman Rahmim, Carlos Uribe, François Bénard, Jonn Wu, Roberto Fedrigo, Haley Clark

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Objective. To simultaneously deblur and supersample prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positron emission tomography (PET) images using neural blind deconvolution.Approach. Blind deconvolution is a method of estimating the hypothetical 'deblurred' image along with the blur kernel (related to the point spread function) simultaneously. Traditionalmaximum a posterioriblind deconvolution methods require stringent assumptions and suffer from convergence to a trivial solution. A method of modelling the deblurred image and kernel with independent neural networks, called 'neural blind deconvolution' had demonstrated success for deblurring 2D natural images in 2020. In this work, we adapt neural blind deconvolution to deblur PSMA PET images while simultaneous supersampling to double the original resolution. We compare this methodology with several interpolation methods in terms of resultant blind image quality metrics and test the model's ability to predict accurate kernels by re-running the model after applying artificial 'pseudokernels' to deblurred images. The methodology was tested on a retrospective set of 30 prostate patients as well as phantom images containing spherical lesions of various volumes.Main results. Neural blind deconvolution led to improvements in image quality over other interpolation methods in terms of blind image quality metrics, recovery coefficients, and visual assessment. Predicted kernels were similar between patients, and the model accurately predicted several artificially-applied pseudokernels. Localization of activity in phantom spheres was improved after deblurring, allowing small lesions to be more accurately defined.Significance. The intrinsically low spatial resolution of PSMA PET leads to partial volume effects (PVEs) which negatively impact uptake quantification in small regions. The proposed method can be used to mitigate this issue, and can be straightforwardly adapted for other imaging modalities.

TITLE: Predicting time-of-flight with Cerenkov light in BGO: a three-stage network approach with multiple timing kernels prior

AUTHORS: Xuhui Feng, Hengjia Ran, Huafeng Liu

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Objective.In the quest for enhanced image quality in positron emission tomography (PET) reconstruction, the introduction of time-of-flight (TOF) constraints in TOF-PET reconstruction offers superior signal-to-noise ratio. By employing BGO detectors capable of simultaneously emitting prompt Cerenkov light and scintillation light, this approach combines the high time resolution of prompt photons with the high energy resolution of scintillation light, thereby presenting a promising avenue for acquiring more precise TOF information.Approach.In Stage One, we train a raw method capable of predicting TOF information based on coincidence waveform pairs. In Stage Two, the data is categorized into 25 classes based on signal rise time, and the pre-trained raw method is utilized to obtain TOF kernels for each of the 25 classes, thereby generating prior knowledge. Within Stage Three, our proposed deep learning (DL) module, combined with a bias fine-tuning module, utilizes the kernel prior to provide bias compensation values for the data, thereby refining the first-stage outputs and obtaining more accurate TOF predictions.Main results.The three-stage network built upon the LED method resulted in improvements of 11.7 ps and 41.8 ps for full width at half maximum (FWHM) and full width at tenth maximum (FWTM), respectively. Optimal performance was achieved with FWHM of 128.2 ps and FWTM of 286.6 ps when CNN and Transformer were utilized in Stages One and Three, respectively. Further enhancements of 2.3 ps and 3.5 ps for FWHM and FWTM were attained through data augmentation methods.Significance.This study employs neural networks to compensate for the timing delays in mixed (Cerenkov and scintillation photons) signals, combining multiple timing kernels as prior knowledge with DL models. This integration yields optimal predictive performance, offering a superior solution for TOF-PET research utilizing Cerenkov signals.

TITLE: Denoising non-steady state dynamic PET data using a feed-forward neural network

AUTHORS: G I Angelis, O K Fuller, J E Gillam, S R Meikle

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
The quality of reconstructed dynamic PET images, as well as the statistical reliability of the estimated pharmacokinetic parameters is often compromised by high levels of statistical noise, particularly at the voxel level. Many denoising strategies have been proposed, both in the temporal and spatial domain, which substantially improve the signal to noise ratio of the reconstructed dynamic images. However, although most filtering approaches are fairly successful in reducing the spatio-temporal inter-voxel variability, they may also average out or completely eradicate the critically important temporal signature of a transient neurotransmitter activation response that may be present in a non-steady state dynamic PET study. In this work, we explore an approach towards temporal denoising of non-steady state dynamic PET images using an artificial neural network, which was trained to identify the temporal profile of a time-activity curve, while preserving any potential activation response. We evaluated the performance of a feed-forward perceptron neural network to improve the signal to noise ratio of dynamic [11C]raclopride activation studies and compared it with the widely used highly constrained back projection (HYPR) filter. Results on both simulated Geant4 Application for Tomographic Emission data of a realistic rat brain phantom and experimental animal data of a freely moving animal study showed that the proposed neural network can efficiently improve the noise characteristics of dynamic data in the temporal domain, while it can lead to a more reliable estimation of voxel-wise activation response in target region. In addition, improvements in signal-to-noise ratio achieved by denoising the dynamic data using the proposed neural network led to improved accuracy and precision of the estimated model parameters of the lp-ntPET model, compared to the HYPR filter. The performance of the proposed denoising approach strongly depends on the amount of noise in the dynamic PET data, with higher noise leading to substantially higher variability in the estimated parameters of the activation response. Overall, the feed-forward network led to a similar performance as the HYPR filter in terms of spatial denoising, but led to notable improvements in terms of temporal denoising, which in turn improved the estimation activation parameters.

TITLE: Comparison of maximum likelihood and conventional PET scatter scaling methods for 18 F-FDG and 68 Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT

AUTHORS: Harshali Bal, Jackson W Kiser, Maurizio Conti, Spencer L Bowen

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: We aim to quantify differences between a new maximum likelihood (ML) background scaling (MLBS) algorithm and two conventional scatter scaling methods for clinical PET/CT. A common source of reduced image quantification with conventional scatter corrections is attributed to erroneous scaling of the initial scatter estimate to match acquired scattered events in the sinogram. MLBS may have performance advantages over conventional methods by using all available data intersecting the subject.

Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on subjects injected with18F-FDG (N = 71) and68Ga-DOTATATE (N = 11) and imaged using time-of-flight (TOF) PET/CT. The scatter distribution was estimated with single scatter simulation approaches. Conventional scaling algorithms included (a) tail fitted background scaling (TFBS), which scales the scatter to "tails" outside the emission support, and (b) absolute scatter correction (ABS), which utilizes the simulated scatter distribution with no scaling applied. MLBS consisted of an alternating iterative reconstruction with a TOF-based ML activity image update allowing negative values (NEG-ML) and nested loop ML scatter scaling estimation. Scatter corrections were compared using reconstructed images as follows: (a) normalized relative difference images were generated and used for voxel-wise analysis, (b) liver and suspected lesion ROIs were drawn to compute mean SUVs, and (c) a qualitative analysis of overall diagnostic image quality, impact of artifacts, and lesion conspicuity was performed. Absolute quantification and normalized relative differences were also assessed with an18F-FDG phantom study.

Results: For human subjects18F-FDG data, Bland-Altman plots demonstrated that the largest normalized voxel-wise differences were observed close to the lower limit (SUV = 1.0). MLBS reconstructions trended towards higher scatter fractions compared to TFBS and ABS images, with median voxel differences across all subjects for TFBS-MLBS measured at 1.7% and 7.6% for18F-FDG and68Ga-DOTATATE, respectively. For mean SUV analysis, there was a high degree of correlation between the scatter corrections. For18F-FDG, ABS scatter correction reconstructions trended towards higher liver mean SUVs relative to MLBS. The qualitative image analysis revealed no significant differences between TFBS and MLBS image reconstructions. For a uniformly filled relatively large 37 cm diameter phantom, MLBS produced the lowest bias in absolute quantification, while normalized voxel-wise differences showed a trend in scatter correction performance consistent with the human subjects study.

Conclusions: For18F-FDG, MLBS is at least a valid substitute to TFBS, providing reconstructed image performance comparable to TFBS in most subjects but exhibiting quantitative differences in cases where TFBS is typically prone to inaccuracies (e.g., due to patient motion and CT-based attenuation map truncation). Particularly for low contrast regions, quantification differs for ABS compared to MLBS and TFBS, and caution should be taken when utilizing ABS for decision-making based on quantitative metrics.

TITLE: Source-to-Target Automatic Rotating Estimation (STARE) - A publicly-available, blood-free quantification approach for PET tracers with irreversible kinetics: Theoretical framework and validation for [18F]FDG

AUTHORS: Elizabeth A Bartlett, R Todd Ogden, J John Mann, Francesca Zanderigo

JOURNAL: NeuroImage

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Introduction: Full quantification of positron emission tomography (PET) data requires an input function. This generally means arterial blood sampling, which is invasive, labor-intensive and burdensome. There is no current, standardized method to fully quantify PET radiotracers with irreversible kinetics in the absence of blood data. Here, we present Source-to-Target Automatic Rotating Estimation (STARE), a novel, data-driven approach to quantify the net influx rate (Ki) of irreversible PET radiotracers, that requires only individual-level PET data and no blood data. We validate STARE with human [18F]FDG PET scans and assess its performance using simulations.

Methods: STARE builds upon a source-to-target tissue model, where the tracer time activity curves (TACs) in multiple "target" regions are expressed at once as a function of a "source" region, based on the two-tissue irreversible compartment model, and separates target region Kifrom source Kiby fitting the source-to-target model across all target regions simultaneously. To ensure identifiability, data-driven, subject-specific anchoring is used in the STARE minimization, which takes advantage of the PET signal in a vasculature cluster in the field of view (FOV) that is automatically extracted and partial volume-corrected. To avoid the need for any a priori determination of a single source region, each of the considered regions acts in turn as the source, and a final Kiis estimated in each region by averaging the estimates obtained in each source rotation.

Results: In a large dataset of human [18F]FDG scans (N = 69), STARE Kiestimates were correlated with corresponding arterial blood-based Kiestimates (r = 0.80), with an overall regression slope of 0.88, and were precisely estimated, as assessed by comparing STARE Kiestimates across several runs of the algorithm (coefficient of variation across runs=6.74 ± 2.48%). In simulations, STARE Kiestimates were largely robust to factors that influence the individualized anchoring used within its algorithm.

Conclusion: Through simulations and application to [18F]FDG PET data, feasibility is demonstrated for STARE blood-free, data-driven quantification of Ki. Future work will include applying STARE to PET data obtained with a portable PET camera and to other irreversible radiotracers.

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Objective.This study presents and evaluates a robust Monte Carlo-based scatter correction (SC) method for long axial field of view (FOV) and total-body positron emission tomography (PET) using the uEXPLORER total-body PET/CT scanner.Approach.Our algorithm utilizes the Monte Carlo (MC) tool SimSET to compute SC factors in between individual image reconstruction iterations within our in-house list-mode and time-of-flight-based image reconstruction framework. We also introduced a unique scatter scaling technique at the detector block-level for optimal estimation of the scatter contribution in each line of response. First image evaluations were derived from phantom data spanning the entire axial FOV along with image data from a human subject with a large body mass index. Data was evaluated based on qualitative inspections, and contrast recovery, background variability, residual scatter removal from cold regions, biases and axial uniformity were quantified and compared to non-scatter-corrected images.Main results.All reconstructed images demonstrated qualitative and quantitative improvements compared to non-scatter-corrected images: contrast recovery coefficients improved by up to 17.2% and background variability was reduced by up to 34.3%, and the residual lung error was between 1.26% and 2.08%. Low biases throughout the axial FOV indicate high quantitative accuracy and axial uniformity of the corrections. Up to 99% of residual activity in cold areas in the human subject was removed, and the reliability of the method was demonstrated in challenging body regions like in the proximity of a highly attenuating knee prosthesis.Significance.The MC SC method employed was demonstrated to be accurate and robust in TB-PET. The results of this study can serve as a benchmark for optimizing the quantitative performance of future SC techniques.

TITLE: Deep learning-based attenuation correction for whole-body PET - a multi-tracer study with 18F-FDG, 68 Ga-DOTATATE, and 18F-Fluciclovine

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
A novel deep learning (DL)-based attenuation correction (AC) framework was applied to clinical whole-body oncology studies using18F-FDG,68Ga-DOTATATE, and18F-Fluciclovine. The framework used activity (λ-MLAA) and attenuation (µ-MLAA) maps estimated by the maximum likelihood reconstruction of activity and attenuation (MLAA) algorithm as inputs to a modified U-net neural network with a novel imaging physics-based loss function to learn a CT-derived attenuation map (µ-CT).

Methods: Clinical whole-body PET/CT datasets of18F-FDG (N = 113),68Ga-DOTATATE (N = 76), and18F-Fluciclovine (N = 90) were used to train and test tracer-specific neural networks. For each tracer, forty subjects were used to train the neural network to predict attenuation maps (µ-DL). µ-DL and µ-MLAA were compared to the gold-standard µ-CT. PET images reconstructed using the OSEM algorithm with µ-DL (OSEMDL) and µ-MLAA (OSEMMLAA) were compared to the CT-based reconstruction (OSEMCT). Tumor regions of interest were segmented by two radiologists and tumor SUV and volume measures were reported, as well as evaluation using conventional image analysis metrics.

Results: µ-DL yielded high resolution and fine detail recovery of the attenuation map, which was superior in quality as compared to µ-MLAA in all metrics for all tracers. Using OSEMCTas the gold-standard, OSEMDLprovided more accurate tumor quantification than OSEMMLAAfor all three tracers, e.g., error in SUVmaxfor OSEMMLAAvs. OSEMDL: - 3.6 ± 4.4% vs. - 1.7 ± 4.5% for18F-FDG (N = 152), - 4.3 ± 5.1% vs. 0.4 ± 2.8% for68Ga-DOTATATE (N = 70), and - 7.3 ± 2.9% vs. - 2.8 ± 2.3% for18F-Fluciclovine (N = 44). OSEMDLalso yielded more accurate tumor volume measures than OSEMMLAA, i.e., - 8.4 ± 14.5% (OSEMMLAA) vs. - 3.0 ± 15.0% for18F-FDG, - 14.1 ± 19.7% vs. 1.8 ± 11.6% for68Ga-DOTATATE, and - 15.9 ± 9.1% vs. - 6.4 ± 6.4% for18F-Fluciclovine.

Conclusions: The proposed framework provides accurate and robust attenuation correction for whole-body18F-FDG,68Ga-DOTATATE and18F-Fluciclovine in tumor SUV measures as well as tumor volume estimation. The proposed method provides clinically equivalent quality as compared to CT in attenuation correction for the three tracers.

TITLE: Attenuation correction and truncation completion for breast PET/MR imaging using deep learning

AUTHORS: Xue Li, Jacob M Johnson, Roberta M Strigel, Leah C Henze Bancroft, Samuel A Hurley, S Iman Zare Estakhraji, Manoj Kumar, Amy M Fowler, Alan B McMillan

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Objective. Simultaneous PET/MR scanners combine the high sensitivity of MR imaging with the functional imaging of PET. However, attenuation correction of breast PET/MR imaging is technically challenging. The purpose of this study is to establish a robust attenuation correction algorithm for breast PET/MR images that relies on deep learning (DL) to recreate the missing portions of the patient's anatomy (truncation completion), as well as to provide bone information for attenuation correction from only the PET data.Approach. Data acquired from 23 female subjects with invasive breast cancer scanned with18F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT and PET/MR localized to the breast region were used for this study. Three DL models, U-Net with mean absolute error loss (DLMAE) model, U-Net with mean squared error loss (DLMSE) model, and U-Net with perceptual loss (DLPerceptual) model, were trained to predict synthetic CT images (sCT) for PET attenuation correction (AC) given non-attenuation corrected (NAC) PETPET/MRimages as inputs. The DL and Dixon-based sCT reconstructed PET images were compared against those reconstructed from CT images by calculating the percent error of the standardized uptake value (SUV) and conducting Wilcoxon signed rank statistical tests.Main results. sCT images from the DLMAEmodel, the DLMSEmodel, and the DLPerceptualmodel were similar in mean absolute error (MAE), peak-signal-to-noise ratio, and normalized cross-correlation. No significant difference in SUV was found between the PET images reconstructed using the DLMSEand DLPerceptualsCTs compared to the reference CT for AC in all tissue regions. All DL methods performed better than the Dixon-based method according to SUV analysis.Significance. A 3D U-Net with MSE or perceptual loss model can be implemented into a reconstruction workflow, and the derived sCT images allow successful truncation completion and attenuation correction for breast PET/MR images.

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear cardiology : official publication of the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Background: Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET) with suppression of myocardial glucose utilization plays a pivotal role in diagnosing cardiac sarcoidosis. Reorientation of images to match perfusion datasets and myocardial segmentation enables consistent image scaling and quantification. However, such manual tasks are cumbersome. We developed a 3D U-Net deep-learning (DL) algorithm for automated myocardial segmentation in cardiac sarcoidosis FDG PET.

Methods: The DL model was trained on FDG PET scans from 316 patients with left ventricular contours derived from paired perfusion datasets. Qualitative analysis of clinical readability was performed to compare DL segmentation with the current automated method on a 50-patient test subset. Additionally, left ventricle displacement and angulation, as well as SUVmax sampling were compared with inter-user reproducibility results. A hybrid workflow was also investigated to accelerate study processing time.

Results: DL segmentation enhanced readability scores in over 90% of cases compared with the standard segmentation currently used in the software. DL segmentation performed similar to a trained technologist, surpassing standard segmentation for left ventricle displacement and angulation, as well as correlation of SUVmax. Using the DL segmentation as initial placement for manual segmentation significantly decreased the processing time.

TITLE: Data-Driven Motion Detection and Event-by-Event Correction for Brain PET: Comparison with Vicra

ABSTRACT:
Head motion degrades image quality and causes erroneous parameter estimates in tracer kinetic modeling in brain PET studies. Existing motion correction methods include frame-based image registration (FIR) and correction using real-time hardware-based motion tracking (HMT) information. However, FIR cannot correct for motion within 1 predefined scan period, and HMT is not readily available in the clinic since it typically requires attaching a tracking device to the patient. In this study, we propose a motion correction framework with a data-driven algorithm, that is, using the PET raw data itself, to address these limitations.Methods:We propose a data-driven algorithm, centroid of distribution (COD), to detect head motion. In COD, the central coordinates of the line of response of all events are averaged over 1-s intervals to generate a COD trace. A point-to-point change in the COD trace in 1 direction that exceeded a user-defined threshold was defined as a time point of head motion, which was followed by manually adding additional motion time points. All the frames defined by such time points were reconstructed without attenuation correction and rigidly registered to a reference frame. The resulting transformation matrices were then used to perform the final motion-compensated reconstruction. We applied the new COD framework to 23 human dynamic datasets, all containing large head motion, with18F-FDG (n= 13) and11C-UCB-J ((R)-1-((3-(11C-methyl-11C)pyridin-4-yl)methyl)-4-(3,4,5-trifluorophenyl)pyrrolidin-2-one) (n= 10) and compared its performance with FIR and with HMT using Vicra (an optical HMT device), which can be considered the gold standard.Results:The COD method yielded a 1.0% ± 3.2% (mean ± SD across all subjects and 12 gray matter regions) SUV difference for18F-FDG (3.7% ± 5.4% for11C-UCB-J) compared with HMT, whereas no motion correction (NMC) and FIR yielded -15.7% ± 12.2% (-20.5% ± 15.8%) and -4.7% ± 6.9% (-6.2% ± 11.0%), respectively. For18F-FDG dynamic studies, COD yielded differences of 3.6% ± 10.9% inKivalue as compared with HMT, whereas NMC and FIR yielded -18.0% ± 39.2% and -2.6% ± 19.8%, respectively. For11C-UCB-J, COD yielded 3.7% ± 5.2% differences inVTcompared with HMT, whereas NMC and FIR yielded -20.0% ± 12.5% and -5.3% ± 9.4%, respectively.Conclusion:The proposed COD-based data-driven motion correction method outperformed FIR and achieved comparable or even better performance than the Vicra HMT method in both static and dynamic studies.

TITLE: Impact of low injected activity on data driven respiratory gating for PET/CT imaging with continuous bed motion

AUTHORS: Joseph G Meier, Radwan H Diab, Trevor M Connor, Osama R Mawlawi

JOURNAL: Journal of applied clinical medical physics

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Data driven respiratory gating (DDG) in positron emission tomography (PET) imaging extracts respiratory waveforms from the acquired PET data obviating the need for dedicated external devices. DDG performance, however, degrades with decreasing detected number of coincidence counts. In this paper, we assess the clinical impact of reducing injected activity on a new DDG algorithm designed for PET data acquired with continuous bed motion (CBM_DDG) by evaluating CBM_DDG waveforms, tumor quantification, and physician's perception of motion blur in resultant images. Forty patients were imaged on a Siemens mCT scanner in CBM mode. Reduced injected activity was simulated by generating list mode datasets with 50% and 25% of the original data (100%). CBM_DDG waveforms were compared to that of the original data over the range between the aortic arch and the center of the right kidney using the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC). Tumor quantification was assessed by comparing the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) and peak SUV (SUVpeak) of reconstructed images from the various list mode datasets using elastic motion deblurring (EMDB) reconstruction. Perceived motion blur was assessed by three radiologists of one lesion per patient on a continuous scale from no motion blur (0) to significant motion blur (3). The mean PCC of the 50% and 25% dataset waveforms was 0.74 ± 0.18 and 0.59 ± 0.25, respectively. In comparison to the 100% datasets, the mean SUVmax increased by 2.25% (p = 0.11) for the 50% datasets and by 3.91% (p = 0.16) for the 25% datasets, while SUVpeak changes were within ±0.25%. Radiologist evaluations of motion blur showed negligible changes with average values of 0.21, 0.3, and 0.28 for the 100%, 50%, and 25% datasets. Decreased injected activities degrades the resultant CBM_DDG respiratory waveforms; however this decrease has minimal impact on quantification and perceived image motion blur.

TITLE: Comparison of the performances of machine learning and deep learning in improving the quality of low dose lung cancer PET images

AUTHORS: Ying-Hwey Nai, Hoi Yin Loi, Sophie O'Doherty, Teng Hwee Tan, Anthonin Reilhac

JOURNAL: Japanese journal of radiology

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: To compare the performances of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) in improving the quality of low dose (LD) lung cancer PET images and the minimum counts required.

Materials and methods: 33 standard dose (SD) PET images, were used to simulate LD PET images at seven-count levels of 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 7.5 and 10 million (M) counts. Image quality transfer (IQT), a ML algorithm that uses decision tree and patch-sampling was compared to two DL networks-HighResNet (HRN) and deep-boosted regression (DBR). Supervised training was performed by training the ML and DL algorithms with matched-pair SD and LD images. Image quality evaluation and clinical lesion detection tasks were performed by three readers. Bias in 53 radiomic features, including mean SUV, was evaluated for all lesions.

Results: ML- and DL-estimated images showed higher signal and smaller error than LD images with optimal image quality recovery achieved using LD down to 5 M counts. True positive rate and false discovery rate were fairly stable beyond 5 M counts for the detection of small and large true lesions. Readers rated average or higher ratings to images estimated from LD images of count levels above 5 M only, with higher confidence in detecting true lesions.

Conclusion: LD images with a minimum of 5 M counts (8.72 MBq for 10 min scan or 25 MBq for 3 min scan) are required for optimal clinical use of ML and DL, with slightly better but more varied performance shown by DL.

TITLE: Technical Note: Ultra high-resolution radiotracer-specific digital pet brain phantoms based on the BigBrain atlas

AUTHORS: Martin A Belzunce, Andrew J Reader

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: To introduce a method that allows the generation of ultra high-resolution (submillimeter) heterogeneous digital PET brain phantoms and to provide a new publicly available []FDG phantom as an example.

Method: The radiotracer distribution of the phantom is estimated by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler distance between the parameterized unknown phantom distribution and a radiotracer-specific template used as a reference. The phantom is modelled using the histological and tissue classified volumes of the BigBrain atlas to provide both high resolution and heterogeneity. The Hammersmith brain atlas is also included to allow the estimation of different activity values in different anatomical regions of the brain. Using this method, a realistic []FDG phantom was produced, where a single real []FDG scan was used as the reference to match. An MRI T1-weighted image, obtained from the BigBrain atlas, and a pseudo-CT are included to complete the dataset. A full PET-MRI dataset was simulated and reconstructed with MR-guided methods for the new []FDG phantom.

Results: An ultra high-resolution (400 μm voxel size) and heterogeneous phantom for []FDG was obtained. The radiotracer activity follows the patterns observed in the scan used as a reference. The simulated PET-MRI dataset provided a realistic simulation that was able to be reconstructed with MR-guided methods. By visual inspection, the reconstructed images showed similar patterns to the real data and the improvements in contrast and noise with respect to the standard MLEM reconstruction were more modest compared to simulations done with a simpler phantom, which was created from the same MRI image used to assist the reconstruction.

Conclusions: A method to create high-resolution heterogeneous digital brain phantoms for different PET radiotracers has been presented and successfully employed to create a new publicly available []FDG phantom. The generated phantom is of high resolution, is heterogeneous, and simulates the uptake of the radiotracer in the different regions of the brain.

TITLE: MDPET: A Unified Motion Correction and Denoising Adversarial Network for Low-Dose Gated PET

AUTHORS: Bo Zhou, Yu-Jung Tsai, Xiongchao Chen, James S Duncan, Chi Liu

JOURNAL: IEEE transactions on medical imaging

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
In positron emission tomography (PET), gating is commonly utilized to reduce respiratory motion blurring and to facilitate motion correction methods. In application where low-dose gated PET is useful, reducing injection dose causes increased noise levels in gated images that could corrupt motion estimation and subsequent corrections, leading to inferior image quality. To address these issues, we propose MDPET, a unified motion correction and denoising adversarial network for generating motion-compensated low-noise images from low-dose gated PET data. Specifically, we proposed a Temporal Siamese Pyramid Network (TSP-Net) with basic units made up of 1.) Siamese Pyramid Network (SP-Net), and 2.) a recurrent layer for motion estimation among the gates. The denoising network is unified with our motion estimation network to simultaneously correct the motion and predict a motion-compensated denoised PET reconstruction. The experimental results on human data demonstrated that our MDPET can generate accurate motion estimation directly from low-dose gated images and produce high-quality motion-compensated low-noise reconstructions. Comparative studies with previous methods also show that our MDPET is able to generate superior motion estimation and denoising performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/bbbbbbzhou/MDPET.

TITLE: Effects of point spread function correction and time-of-flight on visual contrast level and pixel values in brain PET images

AUTHORS: Yohei Kamikawa, Yukito Yoshida, Yasuhiro Kawahara

JOURNAL: Nuclear medicine communications

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Objectives: Point spread function (PSF) correction and time-of-flight (TOF) can improve the quality of PET images. None have directly assessed the visual effects of these methods in brain PET images and evaluated the image quality from these methods based on the relationship between the number of updates and noise level. The present study aimed to clarify the effects of PSF and TOF on the visual contrast level and pixel values of brain PET images using an experimental phantom.

Materials and methods: The visual contrast level was evaluated based on the sum of edge strengths. In addition, the effects of PSF, TOF, and a combination of them on pixel values were evaluated after anatomical standardization of brain images, in which the whole brain was divided into 18 segments. These were evaluated using images reconstructed with the number of updates set to achieve the same noise level.

Results: Combined application of the point spread function and TOF resulted in the greatest increase in the sum of edge strengths (32%), followed by PSF (21%) and TOF (6%). The maximum increase in pixel values occurred in the thalamic area (17%).

Conclusion: Although PSF and TOF can increase the visual contrast level by increasing the sum of edge strengths, they may affect the results of software-based analysis using pixel values. Nonetheless, using these methods may improve the ability to visualize areas of hypoaccumulation, such as epileptic foci.

TITLE: Evaluation of a model-based attenuation correction method on whole-body 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging

AUTHORS: Hitoshi Kubo, Ayaka Nemoto, Naoyuki Ukon, Hiroshi Ito

JOURNAL: Radiological physics and technology

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
The bone cannot be evaluated using magnetic resonance attenuation correction (MRAC) with the Dixon sequence. To solve this issue, the present study aimed to evaluate model-based AC for whole-body 2-[fluorine-18]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) by creating bone segmentation. We analyzed and evaluated the data of 31 consecutive patients. The Biograph mMR (Siemens Healthcare) was used for clinical whole-body18F-FDG PET/MRI with the conventional MRAC method, and OSIRIX MD software was used to analyze the images. After the examination, the new model-based post-processing MRAC was applied to create μ-maps with bone segmentation, and retrospective PET reconstruction was performed using this μ-map. The bone structures of all patients created using model-based MRAC were visually evaluated. Standard uptake values (SUVs) at 11 anatomical positions in PET images, corrected using the μ-map with and without bone segmentation, were measured and compared. The model-based post-processing MRAC was run for all patients, without errors. Visual evaluation revealed that the model-based post-processing MRAC exhibited poor results for six patients. Furthermore, it exhibited an increasing trend of SUV in the brain compared to the conventional method. Locations other than the brain indicated a similar or decreasing trend. The two methods showed a good linear correlation for all patients. However, patients aged < 20 years exhibited a different trend from those aged ≥ 20 years. We should exercise caution when applying this model-based MRAC for younger patients.

TITLE: Simultaneous Activity and Attenuation Estimation in TOF-PET With TV-Constrained Nonconvex Optimization

AUTHORS: Zhimei Ren, Emil Y Sidky, Rina Foygel Barber, Chien-Min Kao, Xiaochuan Pan

JOURNAL: IEEE transactions on medical imaging

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
An alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) framework is developed for nonsmooth biconvex optimization for inverse problems in imaging. In particular, the simultaneous estimation of activity and attenuation (SAA) problem in time-of-flight positron emission tomography (TOF-PET) has such a structure when maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is employed. The ADMM framework is applied to MLE for SAA in TOF-PET, resulting in the ADMM-SAA algorithm. This algorithm is extended by imposing total variation (TV) constraints on both the activity and attenuation map, resulting in the ADMM-TVSAA algorithm. The performance of this algorithm is illustrated using the penalized maximum likelihood activity and attenuation estimation (P-MLAA) algorithm as a reference.

TITLE: Self-normalization for a 1 mm3resolution clinical PET system using deep learning

AUTHORS: Myungheon Chin, Mojtaba Jafaritadi, Andrew B Franco, Muhammad Nasir Ullah, Garry Chinn, Derek Innes, Craig S Levin

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Objective.This work proposes, for the first time, an image-based end-to-end self-normalization framework for positron emission tomography (PET) using conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs).Approach.We evaluated different approaches by exploring each of the following three methodologies. First, we used images that were either unnormalized or corrected for geometric factors, which encompass all time-invariant factors, as input data types. Second, we set the input tensor shape as either a single axial slice (2D) or three contiguous axial slices (2.5D). Third, we chose either Pix2Pix or polarized self-attention (PSA) Pix2Pix, which we developed for this work, as a deep learning network. The targets for all approaches were the axial slices of images normalized using the direct normalization method. We performed Monte Carlo simulations of ten voxelized phantoms with the SimSET simulation tool and produced 26,000 pairs of axial image slices for training and testing.Main results.The results showed that 2.5D PSA Pix2Pix trained with geometric-factors-corrected input images achieved the best performance among all the methods we tested. All approaches improved general image quality figures of merit peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index (SSIM) from ∼15 % to ∼55 %, and 2.5D PSA Pix2Pix showed the highest PSNR (28.074) and SSIM (0.921). Lesion detectability, measured with region of interest (ROI) PSNR, SSIM, normalized contrast recovery coefficient, and contrast-to-noise ratio, was generally improved for all approaches, and 2.5D PSA Pix2Pix trained with geometric-factors-corrected input images achieved the highest ROI PSNR (28.920) and SSIM (0.973).Significance.This study demonstrates the potential of an image-based end-to-end self-normalization framework using cGANs for improving PET image quality and lesion detectability without the need for separate normalization scans.

AUTHORS: Muhan Shao, Darrin W Byrd, Jhimli Mitra, Fatemeh Behnia, Jean H Lee, Amir Iravani, Murat Sadic, Delphine L Chen, Scott D Wollenweber, Craig K Abbey, Paul E Kinahan, Sangtae Ahn

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Background: Lesion detection is one of the most important clinical tasks in positron emission tomography (PET) for oncology. An anthropomorphic model observer (MO) designed to replicate human observers (HOs) in a detection task is an important tool for assessing task-based image quality. The channelized Hotelling observer (CHO) has been the most popular anthropomorphic MO. Recently, deep learning MOs (DLMOs), mostly based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have been investigated for various imaging modalities. However, there have been few studies on DLMOs for PET.

Purpose: The goal of the study is to investigate whether DLMOs can predict HOs better than conventional MOs such as CHO in a two-alternative forced-choice (2AFC) detection task using PET images with real anatomical variability.

Methods: Two types of DLMOs were implemented: (1) CNN DLMO, and (2) CNN-SwinT DLMO that combines CNN and Swin Transformer (SwinT) encoders. Lesion-absent PET images were reconstructed from clinical data, and lesion-present images were reconstructed with adding simulated lesion sinogram data. Lesion-present and lesion-absent PET image pairs were labeled by eight HOs consisting of four radiologists and four image scientists in a 2AFC detection task. In total, 2268 pairs of lesion-present and lesion-absent images were used for training, 324 pairs for validation, and 324 pairs for test. CNN DLMO, CNN-SwinT DLMO, CHO with internal noise, and non-prewhitening matched filter (NPWMF) were compared in the same train-test paradigm. For comparison, six quantitative metrics including prediction accuracy, mean squared errors (MSEs) and correlation coefficients, which measure how well a MO predicts HOs, were calculated in a 9-fold cross-validation experiment.

Results: In terms of the accuracy and MSE metrics, CNN DLMO and CNN-SwinT DLMO showed better performance than CHO and NPWMF, and CNN-SwinT DLMO showed the best performance among the MOs evaluated.

Conclusions: DLMO can predict HOs more accurately than conventional MOs such as CHO in PET lesion detection. Combining SwinT and CNN encoders can improve the DLMO prediction performance compared to using CNN only.

TITLE: PICASSO: a universal brain phantom for positron emission tomography based on the activity painting technique

AUTHORS: Ekaterina Shanina, Benjamin A Spencer, Tiantian Li, Bangyan Huang, Jinyi Qi, Simon R Cherry

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Objective. This study presents a universal phantom for positron emission tomography (PET) that allows arbitrary static and dynamic activity distributions of various complexities to be generated using a single PET acquisition.Approach. We collected a high-statistics dataset (with a total of 22.4 × 109prompt coincidences and an event density of 2.75 × 106events mm-3) by raster-scanning a single plane with a22Na point source mounted on a robotic arm in the field-of-view of the uEXPLORER PET/CT scanner. The source position was determined from the reconstructed dynamic frames. Uniquely, true coincidences were separated from scattered and random events based on the distance between their line-of-response and the known source location. Finally, we randomly sampled the dataset to generate the desired activity distributions modeling several different phantoms.Main results. Overall, the target and the reconstructed phantom images had good agreement. The analysis of a simple geometric distribution showed high quantitative accuracy of the phantom, with mean error of <-3.0% relative to the ground truth for activity concentrations ranging from 5.3 to 47.7 kBq ml-1. The model of a high-resolution18F-fluorodeoxyglucose distribution in the brain illustrates the usefulness of the technique in simulating realistic static neuroimaging studies. A dynamic18F-florbetaben study was modeled based on the time-activity curves of a human study and a segmented brain phantom with no coincidences repeating between frames. For all time points, the mean voxel-wise errors ranged from -4.4% to -0.7% in grey matter and from -3.9% to +2.8% in white matter.Significance. The proposed phantom technique is highly flexible and allows modeling of static and dynamic brain PET studies with high quantitative accuracy. It overcomes several key limitations of the existing phantoms and has many promising applications for the purposes of image reconstruction, data correction methods, and system performance evaluation, particularly for new high-performance dedicated brain PET scanners.

ABSTRACT:
Research on different machine learning (ML) has become incredibly popular during the past few decades. However, for some researchers not familiar with statistics, it might be difficult to understand how to evaluate the performance of ML models and compare them with each other. Here, we introduce the most common evaluation metrics used for the typical supervised ML tasks including binary, multi-class, and multi-label classification, regression, image segmentation, object detection, and information retrieval. We explain how to choose a suitable statistical test for comparing models, how to obtain enough values of the metric for testing, and how to perform the test and interpret its results. We also present a few practical examples about comparing convolutional neural networks used to classify X-rays with different lung infections and detect cancer tumors in positron emission tomography images.

TITLE: Assessment of motion correction in dynamic rubidium-82 cardiac PET with and without frame-by-frame adjustment of attenuation maps for calculation of myocardial blood flow

AUTHORS: Ian S Armstrong, Matthew J Memmott, Kimberley J Saint, Antoine Saillant, Charles Hayden, Parthiban Arumugam

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear cardiology : official publication of the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Background: Patient motion during pharmacological stressing can have substantial impact on myocardial blood flow (MBF) estimated from dynamic PET. This work evaluated a motion correction algorithm with and without adjustment of the PET attenuation map.

Methods: Frame-by-frame motion correction was performed by three users on 30 rubidium-82 studies. Data were divided equally into three groups of motion severity [mild (M1), moderate (M2) and severe (M3)]. MBF data were compared for non-motion corrected (NC), motion-corrected-only (MC) and with adjustment of the attenuation map (MCAC). Percentage differences of MBF were calculated in the coronary territories and 17-segment polar plots. Polar plots of spill-over were also generated from the data.

Results: Median differences of 23% were seen in the RCA and 18% for the LAD in the M3 category for MC vs NC images. Differences for MCAC vs MC images were considerably smaller and typically < 10%. Spill-over plots for MC and MCAC were notably more uniform compared with NC images.

Conclusion: Motion correction for dynamic rubidium data is desirable for future MBF software updates. Adjustment of the PET attenuation map results in only marginal differences and therefore is unlikely to be an essential requirement. Assessing the uniformity of spill-over plots is a useful visual aid for verifying motion correction techniques.

JOURNAL: Igaku butsuri : Nihon Igaku Butsuri Gakkai kikanshi = Japanese journal of medical physics : an official journal of Japan Society of Medical Physics

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
This is an explanatory paper on Sun Il Kwon et al., Nat. Photon. 15: 914-918, 2021 and some parts of this manuscript are translated from the paper. Medical imaging modalities such as X-ray computed tomography, Magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography (PET), and single photon emission computed tomography, require image reconstruction processes, consequently constraining them to form cylindrical shapes. However, among them, only PET can use additional information, so called time of flight, on an event-by-event basis. If coincidence time resolution (CTR) of PET detectors improved to 30 ps, which corresponds to spatial resolution of 4.5 mm, directly localizing electron-positron annihilation point is possible, allowing us to circumvent image reconstruction processes and free us from the geometric constraint. We call this concept direct positron emission imaging (dPEI). We have developed ultrafast radiation detectors by focusing on Cherenkov photon detection. Furthermore, the CTR of 32 ps being equivalent to 4.8 mm spatial resolution is achieved by combining deep learning-based signal processing with the detectors. In this article, we explain how we developed the detectors and demonstrated the first dPEI using different types of phantoms, how we will tackle limitations to be addressed to make the dPEI more practical, and how dPEI will emerge as an imaging modality in nuclear medicine.

TITLE: Phantom test procedures for a new neuro-oncological amino acid PET tracer: [18F]fluciclovine

AUTHORS: Kaede Tsuzura, Kei Wagatsuma, Yuto Kamitaka, Kenta Miwa, Noriaki Miyaji, Takashi Kamiya, Noriyo Yokotsuka, Kenji Ishii

JOURNAL: Annals of nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Objective: Amino acid positron emission tomography (PET) examinations using anti-1-amino-3-[18F]-fluorocyclobutane-1-carboxylic acid ([18F]FACBC) were allowed for routine clinical use in July 2024. However, phantom test procedures for [18F]FACBC reconstruction parameters have not yet been established. The present study aimed to establish new phantom test procedures for [18F]FACBC brain PET imaging to determine optimal reconstruction parameters.

Methods: Background (BG) activity as well as hot sphere and target-to-background ratios (TBRs) of [18F]FACBC were estimated based on brain activity and tumor-to-normal tissue ratios (TNR) in a Japanese clinical trial of [18F]FACBC. Phantom experiments proceeded under [18F]FACBC or L-[methyl-11C]-methionine ([11C]MET) conditions. The number of iterations and the Gaussian filter parameters were determined from the reconstruction parameters %contrastmeanand coefficients of variation (CVs) in ordered subset expectation maximization (OSEM) and time-of-flight (TOF) with or without point-spread-function (PSF) correction.

Results: The amounts of activity in the hot spheres and BG were 1.1 and 5.5 kBq/mL, respectively, and the TBR was 5.0 at the start of acquisition. The %contrastmeanof all hot spheres was higher with [18F]FACBC than [11C]MET, and %contrastmeanconverged between 4 and 6 iterations in hot spheres with diameters < 10 mm. We used four iterations for OSEM + TOF and five for OSEM + TOF + PSF correction for [18F]FACBC and [11C]MET images. The CV was higher for [18F]FACBC than [11C]MET. The optimal sizes of Gaussian filters for OSEM + TOF and OSEM + TOF + PSF correction of image reconstruction were 5 mm for [18F]FACBC, and 4 and 3 mm, respectively, for [11C]MET images.

Conclusions: We estimated phantom activity and TBR based on brain activity in a Japanese clinical trial and established new phantom test procedures for [18F]FACBC. We recommend that the optimal reconstruction parameters for [18F]FACBC should be set to the same number of iterations as [11C]MET and that the FWHM of Gaussian filter should have a few mm higher than [11C]MET to reduce image noise from brain normal tissue.

TITLE: [Investigation of the Influence of Image Reconstruction Parameters to Improve the Ability to Depict Internal Tumor Necrosis]

AUTHORS: Yuka Sakamoto, Yoshihiro Yamamoto, Tadaaki Uegaki

JOURNAL: Nihon Hoshasen Gijutsu Gakkai zasshi

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: There are attempts to assess tumor heterogeneity by texture analysis. However, the ordered subsets-expectation maximization (OSEM) reconstruction method has problems depicting heterogeneities. The aim of this study was to identify image reconstruction parameters that improve the ability to depict internal tumor necrosis using a self-made phantom that simulates internal necrosis.

Methods: Self-made phantoms were prepared using polypropylene cylinders with inner diameters of 18.0 mm and 6.0 mm. The concentration ratios of the simulated tumor : tumor interior were 4 : 0 and 4 : 1. For each reconstruction method, the iteration for OSEM and OSEM+point spread function (PSF) were 1 to 25 and the subset was 12. The β values for block sequential regularized expectation maximization (BSREM) were set between 10 and 400. We evaluated the features of the profile curve, contrast-to-noise ratio, and grey-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM).

Results: In the phantom study, OSEM and OSEM+PSF showed a better delineation of the differences between the inside and outside of the cylinder as iteration was increased and BSREM showed a better delineation as β was decreased. The highest value for each feature, both 4 : 0 and 4 : 1, was BSREM β 10 for angular second moment (ASM) and inverse differential moment (IDM), OSEM iteration 25 for contrast and entropy.

Conclusion: We have identified image reconstruction parameters that improve the ability to visualize internal tumor necrosis. The parameter was BRSEM β 10.

TITLE: Twisted clustered pinhole collimation for improved high-energy preclinical SPECT/PET

AUTHORS: Valerio Cosmi, Monika Kvassheim, Satyajit Ghosh, Freek J Beekman, Marlies C Goorden

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Objective.Advanced pinhole collimation geometries optimized for preclinical high-energyɣimaging facilitate applications such asɑandßemitter imaging, simultaneous multi-isotope PET and PET/SPECT, and positron range-free PET. These geometries replace each pinhole with a group of clustered pinholes (CPs) featuring smaller individual pinhole opening angles (POAs), enabling sub-mm resolution imaging up to ∼1 MeV. Further narrowing POAs while retaining field-of-view (FOV) may enhance high-energy imaging but faces geometrical constraints. Here, we detail how the novel twisted CPs (TCPs) address this challenge.Approach.We compared TCP and CP collimator sensitivity at equal system resolution (SR) and SR at matched sensitivity by tuning pinhole diameters for18F (511 keV) and89Zr (909 keV). Additionally, simulated Derenzo phantoms at low activity (LA: 12 MBq ml-1) and high activity (HA: 190 MBq ml-1) levels, along with uniformity images, were compared to assess image resolution and uniformity.Main results.At equal SR, TCP increased average central FOV sensitivity by 15.6% for18F and 29.4% for89Zr compared to CP. Image resolution was comparable, except for89Zr at LA, where TCP resolved 0.80 mm diameter rods compared to 0.90 mm for CP. Image uniformity was equivalent for18F, while for89Zr TCP granted a 10.4% improvement. For collimators with matched sensitivity, TCP improved SR by 6.6% for18F and 17.7% for89Zr while also enhancing image resolution; for18F, rods distinguished were 0.65 mm (CP) and 0.60 mm (TCP) for HA, and 0.70 mm (CP and TCP) for LA. For89Zr, image resolutions were 0.75 mm (CP) and 0.65 mm (TCP) for HA, and 0.90 mm (CP) and 0.80 mm (TCP) for LA. Image uniformity with TCP decreased by 18.3% for18F but improved by 20.1% for89Zr.Significance.This study suggests that the TCP design has potential to improve high-energyɣimaging.

TITLE: Impact of deep learning-based multiorgan segmentation methods on patient-specific internal dosimetry in PET/CT imaging: A comparative study

AUTHORS: Mehrnoosh Karimipourfard, Sedigheh Sina, Hojjat Mahani, Mehrosadat Alavi, Mehran Yazdi

JOURNAL: Journal of applied clinical medical physics

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Accurate and fast multiorgan segmentation is essential in image-based internal dosimetry in nuclear medicine. While conventional manual PET image segmentation is widely used, it suffers from both being time-consuming as well as subject to human error. This study exploited 2D and 3D deep learning (DL) models. Key organs in the trunk of the body were segmented and then used as a reference for networks.

Methods: The pre-trained p2p-U-Net-GAN and HighRes3D architectures were fine-tuned with PET-only images as inputs. Additionally, the HighRes3D model was alternatively trained with PET/CT images. Evaluation metrics such as sensitivity (SEN), specificity (SPC), intersection over union (IoU), and Dice scores were considered to assess the performance of the networks. The impact of DL-assisted PET image segmentation methods was further assessed using the Monte Carlo (MC)-derived S-values to be used for internal dosimetry.

Results: A fair comparison with manual low-dose CT-aided segmentation of the PET images was also conducted. Although both 2D and 3D models performed well, the HighRes3D offers superior performance with Dice scores higher than 0.90. Key evaluation metrics such as SEN, SPC, and IoU vary between 0.89-0.93, 0.98-0.99, and 0.87-0.89 intervals, respectively, indicating the encouraging performance of the models. The percentage differences between the manual and DL segmentation methods in the calculated S-values varied between 0.1% and 6% with a maximum attributed to the stomach.

Conclusion: The findings prove while the incorporation of anatomical information provided by the CT data offers superior performance in terms of Dice score, the performance of HighRes3D remains comparable without the extra CT channel. It is concluded that both proposed DL-based methods provide automated and fast segmentation of whole-body PET/CT images with promising evaluation metrics. Between them, the HighRes3D is more pronounced by providing better performance and can therefore be the method of choice for 18F-FDG-PET image segmentation.

TITLE: Feasibility of an Ultra-Low-Dose PET Scan Protocol with CT-Based and LSO-TX-Based Attenuation Correction Using a Long-Axial-Field-of-View PET/CT Scanner

ABSTRACT:
Long-axial-field-of-view (LAFOV) PET scanners enable substantial reduction in injected radiotracer activity while maintaining clinically feasible scan times. Whole-body CT scans performed for PET attenuation correction can significantly add to total radiation exposure. We investigated the feasibility of an ultra-low-dose PET protocol and the application of a CT-less PET attenuation correction method (lutetium oxyorthosilicate background transmission [LSO-TX]) that uses176Lu background radiation from detector scintillators with low-count PET data.Methods:Each of the 4 study subjects was scanned for 90 min using an ultra-low-dose18F-FDG protocol (injected activity, 6.7-9.0 MBq) with an LAFOV PET scanner. PET images were reconstructed with different frame durations using low-dose CT-based and LSO-TX-based attenuation maps (μ-maps). The image quality of PET images was assessed by the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the liver and the contrast-to-noise ratio in the brain. Absolute errors in SUVs between PET images reconstructed with LSO-TX-based and CT-based μ-maps were assessed at each scan duration.Results:Visual assessment showed that 20-30 min of PET data obtained using18F-FDG activities below 10 MBq (i.e., 0.1 MBq/kg) can yield high-quality images. PET images reconstructed with CT-based and LSO-TX-based μ-maps had comparable SNRs and contrast-to-noise ratios at all scan durations. The mean ± SD SNRs of PET images reconstructed with the CT-based and the LSO-TX-based μ-maps were 9.2 ± 1.9 dB and 9.8 ± 2.0 dB at 90-min scan duration, 6.8 ± 1.7 dB and 6.9 ± 1.8 dB at 30-min scan duration, and 5.5 ± 1.2 dB and 5.6 ± 1.2 dB at 20-min scan duration, respectively. The relative absolute SUV errors between PET images reconstructed with LSO-TX-based and CT-based μ-maps ranged from 3.1% to 6.4% across different volumes of interest with a 20-min scan duration.Conclusion:PET scans with an LAFOV scanner maintained good visual image quality with18F-FDG activities below 10 MBq for scan durations of 20-30 min. The LSO-TX-based attenuation correction method yielded images comparable to those obtained with the CT-based attenuation correction method in such protocols.

TITLE: A finely segmented semi-monolithic detector tailored for high-resolution PET

AUTHORS: Yannick Kuhl, Florian Mueller, Stephan Naunheim, Matthias Bovelett, Janko Lambertus, David Schug, Bjoern Weissler, Eike Gegenmantel, Pierre Gebhardt, Volkmar Schulz

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Background: Preclinical research and organ-dedicated applications use and require high (spatial-)resolution positron emission tomography (PET) detectors to visualize small structures (early) and understand biological processes at a finer level of detail. Researchers seeking to improve detector and image spatial resolution have explored various detector designs. Current commercial high-resolution systems often employ finely pixelated or monolithic scintillators, each with its limitations.

Purpose: We present a semi-monolithic detector, tailored for high-resolution PET applications with a spatial resolution in the range of 1 mm or better, merging concepts of monolithic and pixelated crystals. The detector features LYSO slabs measuring (24 × 10 × 1) mm3, coupled to a 12 × 12 readout channel photosensor with 4 mm pitch. The slabs are grouped in two arrays of 44 slabs each to achieve a higher optical photon density despite the fine segmentation.

Methods: We employ a fan beam collimator for fast calibration to train machine-learning-based positioning models for all three dimensions, including slab identification and depth-of-interaction (DOI), utilizing gradient tree boosting (GTB). The data for all dimensions was acquired in less than 2 h. Energy calculation was based on a position-dependent energy calibration. Using an analytical timing calibration, time skews were corrected for coincidence timing resolution (CTR) estimation.

Results: Leveraging machine-learning-based calibration in all three dimensions, we achieved high detector spatial resolution: down to 1.18 mm full width at half maximum (FWHM) detector spatial resolution and 0.75 mm mean absolute error (MAE) in the planar-monolithic direction, and 2.14 mm FWHM and 1.03 mm MAE for DOI at an energy window of (435-585) keV. Correct slab interaction identification in planar-segmented direction exceeded 80%, alongside an energy resolution of 12.7% and a CTR of 450 ps FWHM.

Conclusions: The introduced finely segmented, high-resolution slab detector demonstrates appealing performance characteristics suitable for high-resolution PET applications. The current benchtop-based detector calibration routine allows these detectors to be used in PET systems.

TITLE: Learning Without Real Data Annotations to Detect Hepatic Lesions in PET Images

AUTHORS: Xinyi Yang, Bennett B Chin, Michael Silosky, Jonathan Wehrend, Daniel V Litwiller, Debashis Ghosh, Fuyong Xing

JOURNAL: IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Objective: Deep neural networks have been recently applied to lesion identification in fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) images, but they typically rely on a large amount of well-annotated data for model training. This is extremely difficult to achieve for neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), because of low incidence of NETs and expensive lesion annotation in PET images. The objective of this study is to design a novel, adaptable deep learning method, which uses no real lesion annotations but instead low-cost, list mode-simulated data, for hepatic lesion detection in real-world clinical NET PET images.

Methods: We first propose a region-guided generative adversarial network (RG-GAN) for lesion-preserved image-to-image translation. Then, we design a specific data augmentation module for our list-mode simulated data and incorporate this module into the RG-GAN to improve model training. Finally, we combine the RG-GAN, the data augmentation module and a lesion detection neural network into a unified framework for joint-task learning to adaptatively identify lesions in real-world PET data.

Results: The proposed method outperforms recent state-of-the-art lesion detection methods in real clinical68Ga-DOTATATE PET images, and produces very competitive performance with the target model that is trained with real lesion annotations.

Conclusion: With RG-GAN modeling and specific data augmentation, we can obtain good lesion detection performance without using any real data annotations.

Significance: This study introduces an adaptable deep learning method for hepatic lesion identification in NETs, which can significantly reduce human effort for data annotation and improve model generalizability for lesion detection with PET imaging.

TITLE: The SNR of Positron Emission Data With Gaussian and Non-Gaussian Time-of-Flight Kernels, With Application to Prompt Photon Coincidence

AUTHORS: Johan Nuyts, Michel Defrise, Stefan Gundacker, Emilie Roncali, Paul Lecoq

JOURNAL: IEEE transactions on medical imaging

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
It is well known that measurement of the time-of-flight (TOF) increases the information provided by coincident events in positron emission tomography (PET). This information increase propagates through the reconstruction and improves the signal-to-noise ratio in the reconstructed images. Takehiro Tomitani has analytically computed the gain in variance in the reconstructed image, provided by a particular TOF resolution, for the center of a uniform disk and for a Gaussian TOF kernel. In this paper we extend this result, by computing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) contributed by individual coincidence events for two different tasks. One task is the detection of a hot spot in the center of a uniform cylinder. The second one is the same as that considered by Tomitani, i.e. the reconstruction of the central voxel in the image of a uniform cylinder. In addition, we extend the computation to non-Gaussian TOF kernels. It is found that a modification of the TOF-kernel changes the SNR for both tasks in almost exactly the same way. The proposed method can be used to compare TOF-systems with different and possibly event-dependent TOF-kernels, as encountered when prompt photons, such as Cherenkov photons are present, or when the detector is composed of different scintillators. The method is validated with simple 2D simulations and illustrated by applying it to PET detectors producing optical photons with event-dependent timing characteristics.

TITLE: Local-Mean Preserving Post-Processing Step for Non-Negativity Enforcement in PET Imaging: Application to 90Y-PET

AUTHORS: Mael Millardet, Said Moussaoui, Diana Mateus, Jerome Idier, Thomas Carlier

JOURNAL: IEEE transactions on medical imaging

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
In a low-statistics PET imaging context, the positive bias in regions of low activity is a burning issue. To overcome this problem, algorithms without the built-in non-negativity constraint may be used. They allow negative voxels in the image to reduce, or even to cancel the bias. However, such algorithms increase the variance and are difficult to interpret since the resulting images contain negative activities, which do not hold a physical meaning when dealing with radioactive concentration. In this paper, a post-processing approach is proposed to remove these negative values while preserving the local mean activities. Its original idea is to transfer the value of each voxel with negative activity to its direct neighbors under the constraint of preserving the local means of the image. In that respect, the proposed approach is formalized as a linear programming problem with a specific symmetric structure, which makes it solvable in a very efficient way by a dual-simplex-like iterative algorithm. The relevance of the proposed approach is discussed on simulated and on experimental data. Acquired data from an yttrium-90 phantom show that on images produced by a non-constrained algorithm, a much lower variance in the cold area is obtained after the post-processing step, at the price of a slightly increased bias. More specifically, when compared with the classical OSEM algorithm, images are improved, both in terms of bias and of variance.

TITLE: CT-based attenuation correction of whole-body radiotherapy treatment positioning devices in PET/MRI hybrid imaging

AUTHORS: Leticia Taeubert, Yannick Berker, Bettina Beuthien-Baumann, Aswin L Hoffmann, Esther G C Troost, Marc Kachelrieß, Clarissa Gillmann

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Objective: To implement computed tomography (CT)-based attenuation maps of radiotherapy (RT) positioning hardware and radiofrequency (RF) coils to enable hybrid positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI)-based RT treatment planning.

Materials and methods: The RT positioning hardware consisted of a flat RT table overlay, coil holders for abdominal scans, coil holders for head and neck scans and an MRI compatible hip and leg immobilization device. CT images of each hardware element were acquired on a CT scanner. Based on the CT images, attenuation maps of the devices were created. Validation measurements were performed on a PET/MR scanner using a68Ge phantom (48 MBq, 10 min scan time). Scans with each device in treatment position were performed. Then, reference scans containing only the phantom were taken. The scans were reconstructed online (at the PET/MRI scanner) and offline (via e7tools on a PC) using identical reconstruction parameters. Average reconstructed activity concentrations of the device and reference scans were compared.

Results: The device attenuation maps were successfully implemented. The RT positioning devices caused an average decrease of reconstructed PET activity concentration in the range between -8.3 ± 2.1% (mean ± SD) (head and neck coil holder with coils) to -1.0 ± 0.5% (abdominal coil holder). With attenuation correction taking into account RT hardware, these values were reduced to -2.0 ± 1.2% and -0.6 ± 0.5%, respectively. The results of the offline and online reconstructions were nearly identical, with a difference of up to 0.2%.

Conclusion: The decrease in reconstructed activity concentration caused by the RT positioning devices is clinically relevant and can successfully be corrected using CT-based attenuation maps. Both the offline and online reconstruction methods are viable options.

TITLE: Flexible and modular PET: Evaluating the potential of TOF-DOI panel detectors

AUTHORS: Gašper Razdevšek, Georges El Fakhri, Thibault Marin, Rok Dolenec, Matic Orehar, Yanis Chemli, Alberto Giacomo Gola, David Gascon, Stan Majewski, Rok Pestotnik

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Background: Panel detectors have the potential to provide a flexible, modular approach to Positron Emission Tomography (PET), enabling customization to meet patient-specific needs and scan objectives. The panel design allows detectors to be positioned close to the patient, aiming to enhance sensitivity and spatial resolution through improved geometric coverage and reduced noncollinearity blurring. Parallax error can be mitigated using depth of interaction (DOI) information.

Purpose: One of the key questions the article addresses is: Do panel detectors offer viable clinical imaging capabilities, or does limited angular sampling restrict their utility by causing image distortions and artifacts? Additionally, this article explores the scalability of panel detectors for constructing scanners with a long axial field of view (LAFOV).

Methods: Monte Carlo simulations using GATE software were used to assess the performance of panel detectors with various DOI resolutions and Time-of-Flight (TOF) resolutions as fine as 70 ps. The 3030 cm panels comprised pixelated 3320 mm LSO crystals. Simulations were run on large high-performance computing clusters (122,000 CPU cores). Open-source CASToR software was used for (TOF MLEM) image reconstruction. The image quality of the scanners was assessed using a range of phantoms (NEMA, Derenzo, XCAT, and a high-resolution brain phantom). The Siemens Biograph Vision PET/CT scanner served as the reference model. The performance of larger 12060 cm panels was also evaluated.

Results: Sensitivity increases over threefold when panel-panel distance is reduced from 80 to 40 cm. The noise equivalent count rate, unmodified by TOF gain, of the panel detectors matches that of the reference clinical scanner at a distance of approximately 50 cm between the panels. Spatial resolution perpendicular to the panels improves from 8.7 to 1.6 mm when the panel-panel distance is reduced, and 70 ps + DOI detectors are used instead of 200 ps, no-DOI detectors. With enhanced TOF and DOI capabilities, panel detectors achieve image quality that matches or surpasses the reference scanner while using about four times less detector material. These detectors can be extended for LAFOV imaging without distortions or artifacts. Additionally, improving TOF and DOI performance enhances contrast-to-noise ratios, thereby improving lesion detection.

Conclusions: A compact 2-panel PET scanner can match the performance of conventional scanners, producing high-quality, distortion-free images. Its mobility and flexibility enable novel applications, including bedside imaging and intensive care unitdiagnostics, as well as imaging in positions such as sitting or standing. Furthermore, the modularity of panel detectors offers the potential to construct cost-effective, high-performance total-body imaging systems.

ABSTRACT:
Target volume delineation is a vital but time-consuming and challenging part of radiotherapy, where the goal is to deliver sufficient dose to the target while reducing risks of side effects. For head and neck cancer (HNC) this is complicated by the complex anatomy of the head and neck region and the proximity of target volumes to organs at risk. The purpose of this study was to compare and evaluate conventional PET thresholding methods, six classical machine learning algorithms and a 2D U-Net convolutional neural network (CNN) for automatic gross tumor volume (GTV) segmentation of HNC in PET/CT images. For the latter two approaches the impact of single versus multimodality input on segmentation quality was also assessed. 197 patients were included in the study. The cohort was split into training and test sets (157 and 40 patients, respectively). Five-fold cross-validation was used on the training set for model comparison and selection. Manual GTV delineations represented the ground truth. Tresholding, classical machine learning and CNN segmentation models were ranked separately according to the cross-validation Sørensen-Dice similarity coefficient (Dice). PET thresholding gave a maximum mean Dice of 0.62, whereas classical machine learning resulted in maximum mean Dice scores of 0.24 (CT) and 0.66 (PET; PET/CT). CNN models obtained maximum mean Dice scores of 0.66 (CT), 0.68 (PET) and 0.74 (PET/CT). The difference in cross-validation Dice between multimodality PET/CT and single modality CNN models was significant (p ≤ 0.0001). The top-ranked PET/CT-based CNN model outperformed the best-performing thresholding and classical machine learning models, giving significantly better segmentations in terms of cross-validation and test set Dice, true positive rate, positive predictive value and surface distance-based metrics (p ≤ 0.0001). Thus, deep learning based on multimodality PET/CT input resulted in superior target coverage and less inclusion of surrounding normal tissue.

ABSTRACT:
The myocardial flow reserve (MFR) index proves to be a highly effective means of assessing the severity of myocardial ischemic disease. An MFR value below two commonly indicates impaired coronary artery perfusion function. Nevertheless, the measurement of MFR using the NH3-positron emission tomography (NH3-PET) method is both invasive and time-consuming. In order to alleviate the burden on both patients and doctors, we aim to achieve accurate estimation of MFR through a coronary computed tomography angiography image processing method. In this paper, we propose 2 methods: one is estimation method of MFR using i) coronary flow index (CFI) with multiple linear regression (MLR) and the other one is ii) vertical-time (VT) image with fully connected network (FCN) and convolutional neural network (CNN). We evaluate the performance between the observed and estimated MFR values with the Pearson correlation coefficient. The results show that LAD = 0.31, LCX = 0.19, and RCA = -0.21 in MLR method; LAD = 0.19, LCX =-0.37, and RCA = 0.23 in FCN and LAD = 0.34, LCX = 0.44 and RCA = 0.37 in CNN. The results exhibit superior performance based on VT images-based method compared to the CFI-based method, which show that VT images method is promising.Clinical relevance- MFR is a crucial indicator in the clinical field of cardiovascular diseases, aiding in the early diagnosis, risk assessment, treatment monitoring, and prognosis evaluation of cardiac conditions. Nevertheless, the measurement of MFR using the NH3-PET method is both invasive and time-consuming. Our results show that estimating the MFR through VT images is a promising method.

TITLE: Benefit of Improved Performance with State-of-the Art Digital PET/CT for Lesion Detection in Oncology

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
The latest digital whole-body PET scanners provide a combination of higher sensitivity and improved spatial and timing resolution. We performed a lesion detectability study on two generations of Biograph PET/CT scanners, the mCT Flow and the Vision, to study the impact of improved physical performance on clinical performance. Our hypothesis was that the improved performance of the Vision would result in improved lesion detectability, allowing shorter imaging times or, equivalently, a lower injected dose.Methods:Data were acquired with the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging Clinical Trials Network torso phantom combined with a 20-cm-diameter cylindrical phantom. Spherical lesions were emulated by acquiring sphere-in-air data and combining them with the phantom data to generate combined datasets with embedded lesions of known contrast. Two sphere sizes and uptakes were used: 9.89-mm-diameter spheres with 6:1 (lung) and 3:1 (cylinder) local activity concentration uptakes and 4.95-mm-diameter spheres with 9.6:1 (lung) and 4.5:1 (cylinder) local activity concentration uptakes. Standard image reconstruction was performed: an ordinary Poisson ordered-subsets expectation maximization algorithm with point-spread function and time-of-flight modeling and postreconstruction smoothing with a 5-mm gaussian filter. The Vision images were also generated without any postreconstruction smoothing. Generalized scan statistics methodology was used to estimate the area under the localized receiver-operating-characteristic curve (ALROC).Results:The higher sensitivity and improved time-of-flight performance of the Vision leads to reduced contrast in the background noise nodule distribution. Measured lesion contrast is also higher on the Vision because of its improved spatial resolution. Hence, the ALROC is noticeably higher for the Vision than for the mCT Flow.Conclusion:Improved overall performance of the Vision provides a factor of 4-6 reduction in imaging time (or injected dose) over the mCT Flow when using the ALROC metric for lesions at least 9.89 mm in diameter. Smaller lesions are barely detected in the mCT Flow, leading to even higher ALROC gains with the Vision. The improved spatial resolution of the Vision also leads to a higher measured contrast that is closer to the real uptake, implying improved quantification. Postreconstruction smoothing, however, reduces this improvement in measured contrast, thereby reducing the ALROC for small, high-uptake lesions.

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: SimPET (www.sim-pet.org) is a free cloud-based platform for the generation of realistic brain positron emission tomography (PET) data. In this work, we introduce the key features of the platform. In addition, we validate the platform by performing a comparison between simulated healthy brain FDG-PET images and real healthy subject data for three commercial scanners (GE Advance NXi, GE Discovery ST, and Siemens Biograph mCT).

Methods: The platform provides a graphical user interface to a set of automatic scripts taking care of the code execution for the phantom generation, simulation (SimSET), and tomographic image reconstruction (STIR). We characterize the performance using activity and attenuation maps derived from PET/CT and MRI data of 25 healthy subjects acquired with a GE Discovery ST. We then use the created maps to generate synthetic data for the GE Discovery ST, the GE Advance NXi, and the Siemens Biograph mCT. The validation was carried out by evaluating Bland-Altman differences between real and simulated images for each scanner. In addition, SPM voxel-wise comparison was performed to highlight regional differences. Examples for amyloid PET and for the generation of ground-truth pathological patients are included.

Results: The platform can be efficiently used for generating realistic simulated FDG-PET images in a reasonable amount of time. The validation showed small differences between SimPET and acquired FDG-PET images, with errors below 10% for 98.09% (GE Discovery ST), 95.09% (GE Advance NXi), and 91.35% (Siemens Biograph mCT) of the voxels. Nevertheless, our SPM analysis showed significant regional differences between the simulated images and real healthy patients, and thus, the use of the platform for converting control subject databases between different scanners requires further investigation.

Conclusions: The presented platform can potentially allow scientists in clinical and research settings to perform MC simulation experiments without the need for high-end hardware or advanced computing knowledge and in a reasonable amount of time.

TITLE: ASE-Net: A tumor segmentation method based on image pseudo enhancement and adaptive-scale attention supervision module

AUTHORS: Junzhi Zhang, Huiyan Jiang, Tianyu Shi

JOURNAL: Computers in biology and medicine

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Fluorine 18(18F) fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography and Computed Tomography (PET/CT) is the preferred imaging method of choice for the diagnosis and treatment of many cancers. However, factors such as low-contrast organ and tissue images, and the original scale of tumors pose huge obstacles to the accurate segmentation of tumors. In this work, we propose a novel model ASE-Net which is used for multimodality tumor segmentation. Firstly, we propose a pseudo-enhanced CT image generation method based on metabolic intensity to generate pseudo-enhanced CT images as additional input, which reduces the learning of the network in the spatial position of PET/CT and increases the discriminability of the corresponding structural positions of the high and low metabolic region. Second, unlike previous networks that directly segment tumors of all scales, we propose an Adaptive-Scale Attention Supervision Module at the skip connections, after combining the results of all paths, tumors of different scales will be given different receptive fields. Finally, Dual Path Block is used as the backbone of our network to leverage the ability of residual learning for feature reuse and dense connection for exploring new features. Our experimental results on two clinical PET/CT datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed network and achieve 78.56% and 72.57% in Dice Similarity Coefficient, respectively, which has better performance compared to state-of-the-art network models, whether for large or small tumors. The proposed model will help pathologists formulate more accurate diagnoses by providing reference opinions during diagnosis, consequently improving patient survival rate.

ABSTRACT:
11C-UCB-J is a positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand that has been used in humans for synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A) imaging and as a potential synaptic density marker. The centrum semiovale (CS) is a proposed reference region for noninvasive quantification of11C-UCB-J, due to negligible concentrations of SV2A in this region in baboon brain assessed by in vitro methods. However, in displacement scans with SV2A-specific drug levetiracetam in humans, a decrease in11C-UCB-J concentration was observed in the CS, consistent with some degree of specific binding. The current study aims to validate the CS as a reference region by (1) optimizing CS region of interest (ROI) to minimize spill-in from gray matter with high radioactivity concentrations; (2) investigating convergence of CS ROI values using ordered subset expectation maximization (OS-EM) reconstruction, and (3) comparing baseline CS volume of distribution (VT) to nondisplaceable uptake in gray matter,VND. Improving ROI definition and increasing OS-EM iterations during reconstruction decreased the difference between CSVTandVND. However, even with these corrections, CSVToverestimatedVNDby ∼35-40%. These measures showed significant correlation, suggesting that, though biased, the CS may be a useful estimate of nondisplaceable uptake, allowing for noninvasive quantification for SV2A PET.

ABSTRACT:
Introduction: Brain positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scans are useful for identifying the cause of dementia by evaluating glucose metabolism in the brain with F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose or Aβ deposition with F-18-florbetaben. However, since imaging time ranges from 10 to 30 minutes, movements during the examination might result in image artifacts, which interfere with diagnosis. To solve this problem, data-driven brain motion correction (DDBMC) techniques are capable of performing motion corrected reconstruction using highly accurate motion estimates with high temporal resolution. In this study, we investigated the effectiveness of DDBMC techniques on PET/CT images using a Hoffman phantom, involving continuous rotational and tilting motion, each expanded up to approximately 20 degrees.

Materials and methods: Listmode imaging was performed using a Hoffman phantom that reproduced rotational and tilting motions of the head. Brain motion correction processing was performed on the obtained data. Reconstructed images with and without brain motion correction processing were compared. Visual evaluations by a nuclear medicine specialist and quantitative parameters of images with correction and reference still images were compared.

Results: Normalized Mean Squared Error (NMSE) results demonstrated the effectiveness of DDBMC in compensating for rotational and tilting motions during PET imaging. In Cases 1 and 2 involving rotational motion, NMSE decreased from 0.15-0.2 to approximately 0.01 with DDBMC, indicating a substantial reduction in differences from the reference image across various brain regions. In the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), DDBMC improved it to above 0.96 Contrast assessment revealed notable improvements with DDBMC. In continuous rotational motion, % contrast increased from 42.4% to 73.5%, In tilting motion, % contrast increased from 52.3% to 64.5%, eliminating significant differences from the static reference image. These findings underscore the efficacy of DDBMC in enhancing image contrast and minimizing motion induced variations across different motion scenarios.

Conclusions: DDBMC processing can effectively compensate for continuous rotational and tilting motion of the head during PET, with motion angles of approximately 20 degrees. However, a significant limitation of this study is the exclusive validation of the proposed method using a Hoffman phantom; its applicability to the human brain has not been investigated. Further research involving human subjects is necessary to assess the generalizability and reliability of the presented motion correction technique in real clinical scenarios.

TITLE: PST-Radiomics: a PET/CT lymphoma classification method based on pseudo spatial-temporal radiomic features and structured atrous recurrent convolutional neural network

AUTHORS: Meng Wang, Huiyan Jiang

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Objective.Existing radiomic methods tend to treat each isolated tumor as an inseparable whole, when extracting radiomic features. However, they may discard the critical intra-tumor metabolic heterogeneity (ITMH) information, that contributes to triggering tumor subtypes. To improve lymphoma classification performance, we propose a pseudo spatial-temporal radiomic method (PST-Radiomics) based on positron emission tomography computed tomography (PET/CT).Approach.Specifically, to enable exploitation of ITMH, we first present a multi-threshold gross tumor volume sequence (GTVS). Next, we extract 1D radiomic features based on PET images and each volume in GTVS and create a pseudo spatial-temporal feature sequence (PSTFS) tightly interwoven with ITMH. Then, we reshape PSTFS to create 2D pseudo spatial-temporal feature maps (PSTFM), of which the columns are elements of PSTFS. Finally, to learn from PSTFM in an end-to-end manner, we build a light-weighted pseudo spatial-temporal radiomic network (PSTR-Net), in which a structured atrous recurrent convolutional neural network serves as a PET branch to better exploit the strong local dependencies in PSTFM, and a residual convolutional neural network is used as a CT branch to exploit conventional radiomic features extracted from CT volumes.Main results.We validate PST-Radiomics based on a PET/CT lymphoma subtype classification task. Experimental results quantitatively demonstrate the superiority of PST-Radiomics, when compared to existing radiomic methods.Significance.Feature map visualization of our method shows that it performs complex feature selection while extracting hierarchical feature maps, which qualitatively demonstrates its superiority.

TITLE: Exact parameter identification in PET pharmacokinetic modeling using the irreversible two tissue compartment model

AUTHORS: Martin Holler, Erion Morina, Georg Schramm

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Objective.In quantitative dynamic positron emission tomography (PET), time series of images, reflecting the tissue response to the arterial tracer supply, are reconstructed. This response is described by kinetic parameters, which are commonly determined on basis of the tracer concentration in tissue and the arterial input function. In clinical routine the latter is estimated by arterial blood sampling and analysis, which is a challenging process and thus, attempted to be derived directly from reconstructed PET images. However, a mathematical analysis about the necessity of measurements of the common arterial whole blood activity concentration, and the concentration of free non-metabolized tracer in the arterial plasma, for a successful kinetic parameter identification does not exist. Here we aim to address this problem mathematically.Approach.We consider the identification problem in simultaneous pharmacokinetic modeling of multiple regions of interests of dynamic PET data using the irreversible two-tissue compartment model analytically. In addition to this consideration, the situation of noisy measurements is addressed using Tikhonov regularization. Furthermore, numerical simulations with a regularization approach are carried out to illustrate the analytical results in a synthetic application example.Main results.We provide mathematical proofs showing that, under reasonable assumptions, all metabolic tissue parameters can be uniquely identified without requiring additional blood samples to measure the arterial input function. A connection to noisy measurement data is made via a consistency result, showing that exact reconstruction of the ground-truth tissue parameters is stably maintained in the vanishing noise limit. Furthermore, our numerical experiments suggest that an approximate reconstruction of kinetic parameters according to our analytic results is also possible in practice for moderate noise levels.Significance.The analytical result, which holds in the idealized, noiseless scenario, suggests that for irreversible tracers, fully quantitative dynamic PET imaging is in principle possible without costly arterial blood sampling and metabolite analysis.

JOURNAL: Nihon Hoshasen Gijutsu Gakkai zasshi

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: The deep learning time-of-flight (DL-ToF) aims to replicate the ToF effects through post-processing, applying deep learning-based enhancement to PET images. This study evaluates the effectiveness of DL-ToF using a chest-abdomen phantom that simulates human anatomical structures.

Methods: The 3 DL-ToF intensities (Low-DL-ToF: LDL, Middle-DL-ToF: MDL, High-DL-ToF: HDL) were adopted for the PET image of the chest-abdomen phantom. We assessed the mean SUV of the liver, kidneys, and soft tissue, as well as the maximum SUV of lung and liver tumors. Additionally, non-ToF images were subjected to 3 types of filtering. Texture analysis and shape index maps were used to evaluate filter effects.

Results: No significant differences were observed in the mean SUV between the 3 DL-ToF and non-ToF images. LDL sharpened lung tumors and smoothed liver tumors, while HDL exhibited more pronounced sharpening effects.

Conclusion: The DL-ToF produces image effects similar to ToF in PET imaging.

ABSTRACT:
Objective.ThephenoPET system is a plant dedicated positron emission tomography (PET) scanner consisting of fully digital photo multipliers with lutetium-yttrium oxyorthosilicate crystals and located inside a custom climate chamber. Here, we present the setup ofphenoPET, its data processing and image reconstruction together with its performance.Approach.The performance characterization follows the national electrical manufacturers association (NEMA) standard for small animal PET systems with a number of adoptions due to the vertical oriented bore of a PET for plant sciences. In addition temperature stability and spatial resolution with a hot rod phantom are addressed.Main results.The spatial resolution for a22Na point source at a radial distance of 5 mm to the center of the field-of-view (FOV) is 1.45 mm, 0.82 mm and 1.88 mm with filtered back projection in radial, tangential and axial direction, respectively. A hot rod phantom with18F gives a spatial resolution of up to 1.6 mm. The peak noise-equivalent count rates are 550 kcps @ 35.08 MBq, 308 kcps @ 33 MBq and 45 kcps @ 40.60 MBq for the mouse, rat and monkey size scatter phantoms, respectively. The scatter fractions for these phantoms are 12.63%, 22.64% and 55.90%. We observe a peak sensitivity of up to 3.6% and a total sensitivity of up toS= 2.17%. For the NEMA image quality phantom we observe a uniformity of %STD= 4.22% with ordinary Poisson maximum likelihood expectation-maximization with 52 iterations. Here, recovery coefficients of 0.12, 0.64, 0.89, 0.93 and 0.91 for 1 mm, 2 mm, 3 mm, 4 mm and 5 mm rods are obtained and spill-over ratios of 0.08 and 0.14 for the water-filled and air-filled inserts, respectively.Significance.ThephenoPET and its laboratory are now in routine operation for the administration of [11C]CO2and non-invasive measurement of transport and allocation of11C-labelled photoassimilates in plants.

TITLE: Joint segmentation of tumors in 3D PET-CT images with a network fusing multi-view and multi-modal information

AUTHORS: HaoYang Zheng, Wei Zou, Nan Hu, Jiajun Wang

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Objective. Joint segmentation of tumors in positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) images is crucial for precise treatment planning. However, current segmentation methods often use addition or concatenation to fuse PET and CT images, which potentially overlooks the nuanced interplay between these modalities. Additionally, these methods often neglect multi-view information that is helpful for more accurately locating and segmenting the target structure. This study aims to address these disadvantages and develop a deep learning-based algorithm for joint segmentation of tumors in PET-CT images.Approach. To address these limitations, we propose the Multi-view Information Enhancement and Multi-modal Feature Fusion Network (MIEMFF-Net) for joint tumor segmentation in three-dimensional PET-CT images. Our model incorporates a dynamic multi-modal fusion strategy to effectively exploit the metabolic and anatomical information from PET and CT images and a multi-view information enhancement strategy to effectively recover the lost information during upsamping. A Multi-scale Spatial Perception Block is proposed to effectively extract information from different views and reduce redundancy interference in the multi-view feature extraction process.Main results. The proposed MIEMFF-Net achieved a Dice score of 83.93%, a Precision of 81.49%, a Sensitivity of 87.89% and an IOU of 69.27% on the Soft Tissue Sarcomas dataset and a Dice score of 76.83%, a Precision of 86.21%, a Sensitivity of 80.73% and an IOU of 65.15% on the AutoPET dataset.Significance. Experimental results demonstrate that MIEMFF-Net outperforms existing state-of-the-art models which implies potential applications of the proposed method in clinical practice.

JOURNAL: IEEE transactions on medical imaging

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Low-dose PET offers a valuable means of minimizing radiation exposure in PET imaging. However, the prevalent practice of employing additional CT scans for generating attenuation maps ( -map) for PET attenuation correction significantly elevates radiation doses. To address this concern and further mitigate radiation exposure in low-dose PET exams, we propose an innovative Population-prior-aided Over-Under-Representation Network (POUR-Net) that aims for high-quality attenuation map generation from low-dose PET. First, POUR-Net incorporates an Over-Under-Representation Network (OUR-Net) to facilitate efficient feature extraction, encompassing both low-resolution abstracted and fine-detail features, for assisting deep generation on the full-resolution level. Second, complementing OUR-Net, a population prior generation machine (PPGM) utilizing a comprehensive CT-derived -map dataset, provides additional prior information to aid OUR-Net generation. The integration of OUR-Net and PPGM within a cascade framework enables iterative refinement of -map generation, resulting in the production of high-quality -maps. Experimental results underscore the effectiveness of POUR-Net, showing it as a promising solution for accurate CT-free low-count PET attenuation correction, which also surpasses the performance of previous baseline methods.

ABSTRACT:
Objective: The accuracy of automatic tumor segmentation in PET/computed tomography (PET/CT) images is crucial for the effective treatment and monitoring of Hodgkin lymphoma. This study aims to address the challenges faced by certain segmentation algorithms in accurately differentiating lymphoma from normal organ uptakes due to PET image resolution and tumor heterogeneity.

Materials and methods: Variants of the encoder-decoder architectures are state-of-the-art models for image segmentation. Among these kinds of architectures, U-Net is one of the most famous and predominant for medical image segmentation. In this study, we propose a fully automatic approach for Hodgkin lymphoma segmentation that combines U-Net and DenseNet architectures to reduce network loss for very small lesions, which is trained using the Tversky loss function. The hypothesis is that the fusion of these two deep learning models can improve the accuracy and robustness of Hodgkin lymphoma segmentation. A dataset with 141 samples was used to train our proposed network. Also, to test and evaluate the proposed network, we allocated two separate datasets of 20 samples.

Results: We achieved 0.759 as the mean Dice similarity coefficient with a median value of 0.767, and interquartile range (0.647-0.837). A good agreement was observed between the ground truth of test images against the predicted volume with precision and recall scores of 0.798 and 0.763, respectively.

Conclusion: This study demonstrates that the integration of U-Net and DenseNet architectures, along with the Tversky loss function, can significantly enhance the accuracy of Hodgkin lymphoma segmentation in PET/CT images compared to similar studies.

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Background: Accuracy and precision assessment in radiomic features is important for the determination of their potential to characterize cancer lesions. In this regard, simulation of different imaging conditions using specialized phantoms is increasingly being investigated. In this study, the design and evaluation of a modular multimodality imaging phantom to simulate heterogeneous uptake and enhancement patterns for radiomics quantification in hybrid imaging is presented.

Methods: A modular multimodality imaging phantom was constructed that could simulate different patterns of heterogeneous uptake and enhancement patterns in positron emission tomography (PET), single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. The phantom was designed to be used as an insert in the standard NEMA-NU2 IEC body phantom casing. The entire phantom insert is composed of three segments, each containing three separately fillable compartments. The fillable compartments between segments had different sizes in order to simulate heterogeneous patterns at different spatial scales. The compartments were separately filled with different ratios of99mTc-pertechnetate,18F-fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]FDG), iodine- and gadolinium-based contrast agents for SPECT, PET, CT, and T1-weighted MR imaging respectively. Image acquisition was performed using standard oncological protocols on all modalities and repeated five times for repeatability assessment. A total of 93 radiomic features were calculated. Variability was assessed by determining the coefficient of quartile variation (CQV) of the features. Comparison of feature repeatability at different modalities and spatial scales was performed using Kruskal-Wallis-, Mann-Whitney U-, one-way ANOVA- and independent t-tests.

Results: Heterogeneous uptake and enhancement could be simulated on all four imaging modalities. Radiomic features in SPECT were significantly less stable than in all other modalities. Features in PET were significantly less stable than in MR and CT. A total of 20 features, particularly in the gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) and gray-level run-length matrix (GLRLM) class, were found to be relatively stable in all four modalities for all three spatial scales of heterogeneous patterns (with CQV < 10%).

Conclusion: The phantom was suitable for simulating heterogeneous uptake and enhancement patterns in [18F]FDG-PET,99mTc-SPECT, CT, and T1-weighted MR images. The results of this work indicate that the phantom might be useful for the further development and optimization of imaging protocols for radiomic quantification in hybrid imaging modalities.

TITLE: MPGAN: Multi Pareto Generative Adversarial Network for the denoising and quantitative analysis of low-dose PET images of human brain

JOURNAL: Medical image analysis

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging is widely used in medical imaging for analyzing neurological disorders and related brain diseases. Usually, full-dose imaging for PET ensures image quality but raises concerns about potential health risks of radiation exposure. The contradiction between reducing radiation exposure and maintaining diagnostic performance can be effectively addressed by reconstructing low-dose PET (L-PET) images to the same high-quality as full-dose (F-PET). This paper introduces the Multi Pareto Generative Adversarial Network (MPGAN) to achieve 3D end-to-end denoising for the L-PET images of human brain. MPGAN consists of two key modules: the diffused multi-round cascade generator (GDmc) and the dynamic Pareto-efficient discriminator (DPed), both of which play a zero-sum game for n(n∈1,2,3) rounds to ensure the quality of synthesized F-PET images. The Pareto-efficient dynamic discrimination process is introduced in DPedto adaptively adjust the weights of sub-discriminators for improved discrimination output. We validated the performance of MPGAN using three datasets, including two independent datasets and one mixed dataset, and compared it with 12 recent competing models. Experimental results indicate that the proposed MPGAN provides an effective solution for 3D end-to-end denoising of L-PET images of the human brain, which meets clinical standards and achieves state-of-the-art performance on commonly used metrics.

TITLE: Kernel-based curve-fitting method with spatial regularization for generation of parametric images in dynamic PET

AUTHORS: Hsuan-Ming Huang

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Due to high levels of noise in pixel-wise time-activity curves, the indirect method that generates kinetic parametric images from dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) images often results in poor parametric image quality. We have demonstrated that the quality of parametric images can be improved by denoising dynamic PET images, using gradient-free curve-fitting and applying a kernel-based post-filtering to parametric images. However, many gradient-free curve-fitting methods are time-consuming. Moreover, some parameter estimates (e.g. k2and k3) have large variability. To provide high-quality PET parametric images with low computational cost, we propose a curve-fitting method that incorporates the kernel-based denoising method and the highly constrained backprojection technique into the Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm. We conducted a simulation study to evaluate the performance of the proposed curve-fitting method. Dynamic PET images were reconstructed using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm and were denoised before parameter estimation. Compared to the LM algorithm with and without the kernel-based post-filtering, the proposed method achieved superior performance, offering a decrease in both bias and coefficient of variation (CV) on all parametric images. Overall, the proposed method exhibited lower bias and slightly higher CV than the gradient-free pattern search method with the kernel-based post-filtering (PatS-K). Moreover, the computation time of the proposed method was about 18 times lower than that of the PatS-K method. Finally, we show that the proposed method can further improve the quality of parametric images when dynamic PET images are reconstructed using the kernel-based EM algorithm.

TITLE: Characterization of artificial intelligence performance for lesion detection using synthetic lesions in PET imaging

AUTHORS: Quinn de Bourbon, Shadab Ahamed, Paul Blanc-Durand, Arman Rahmim, Ran Klein

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Background: The use of artificial intelligence (AI) for lesion detection has witnessed increased interest and efforts in recent years. Meanwhile, task-specific characterization and comparison of AI performance is lacking as supportive evidence prior to its implementation in the clinical setting.

Purpose: To evaluate the use of synthetic lesions in positron emission tomography (PET) and computed tomography (CT) to characterize the performance of lesion detection AI in terms of their limits of detection.

Methods: An image library was constructed containing 565 well-characterized synthetic lesions in 114 reconstructed studies from 56 real, disease-free PET/CT patient data. Using the Lesion Synthesis Toolbox (LST), lesions were manually defined in terms of location, size and intensity. These lesions were then synthesized, forward projected, and added to the raw patient PET data before reconstruction using the same methods used clinically. Lesions were also appended to the reconstructed CT images. This library was sent to two external research teams developing AI for lesion detection in fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) PET. AI reported lesions were compared to ground truth data and labelled as hit, miss, or false positive. Psychophysical response models were fitted to each AI's responses to characterize their performance.

Results: Both AI methods confirmed higher lesion detection rates with increased lesion size and contrast. One AI consistently outperformed the other in terms of number of reported lesions, sensitivity, and precision. The fitted psychophysical response model demonstrated both graphically and parametrically an ability of this model to detect smaller lesions for a given degree of reliability. For example, 10 mm diameter lesions could be detected with 90% sensitivity at 8:1 versus 16:1 lesion to background ratio for the two algorithms. Likewise, 3:1 contrast lesions could be detected with 90% sensitivity when lesion diameters were approximately 16 and 31 mm for each algorithm respectively. Compared to defined lesions parameters, the corresponding AI segmented lesions had lower contrast, consistent with partial volume effects in PET imaging, and also smaller size.

Conclusion: Synthetic lesions are a useful tool to characterize the performance of lesion detection by an observer. Visual and psychometric response models of lesion detection performance with respect to lesion characteristics are effective to objectively compare AI performance on the merit of limits of detection. These methods can be applied to objectively compare lesion detection performance with any alternative decision support tool including human and machine observers, display technologies, and image generation systems.

TITLE: Development and evaluation of a prototype detector for an intraoperative laparoscopic coincidence imaging system with PET tracers

AUTHORS: Madhushanka R Liyanaarachchi, Kenji Shimazoe, Hiroyuki Takahashi, Keiichi Nakagawa, Etsuko Kobayashi, Ichiro Sakuma

JOURNAL: International journal of computer assisted radiology and surgery

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Conventional positron emission tomography can be used only preoperatively to identify lymph node metastases, and hence, these growths are difficult to locate intraoperatively. Previously, an intraoperative laparoscopic coincidence imaging system, with an external fixed detector array and a detector probe that can be moved and inserted into the stomach, was proposed to identify lymph node metastases during stomach cancer surgery. This paper proposes a prototype detector for this system.

Methods: GAGG:Ce (Gd3Al2Ga3O12:Ce) scintillator crystals, one to one coupled with silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs), were used to identify 511 keV photons. An optical tracking system followed the position and orientation of the movable detector. SiPM outputs were read out by time-over-threshold (TOT)-based application-specific integrated circuits, which converted the electrical charges into digital pulses. To identify the arrival time, channel number, and pulse width, which indicate the energy information of each TOT output, a data acquisition system was developed based on a field-programmable gate array.

Results: The spatial resolution of the reconstructed images in lateral direction was better than 7 mm, but that of depth direction was limited, owing to inadequate projections. The prototype successfully reconstructed 44 kBq18F-fluorodeoxyglucose sources during a 2-min scan.

Conclusion: We developed a prototype detector for an intraoperative laparoscopic coincidence imaging system. The prototype detector was evaluated successfully, and the produced images were similar to those obtained in the simulation results, thereby suggesting that this method offers a new possibility of imaging lymph node metastases intraoperatively.

TITLE: The reduction of 176Lu background in Lu-based PET scanners using optimized classification

AUTHORS: Qian Wang, Ekaterina Mikhaylova, Reheman Baikejiang, Simon R Cherry

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Positron emission tomography (PET) using scanners incorporating lutetium-based (Lu-based) scintillators are widely used in nuclear medicine. However their application in imaging very low (<100 kBq) activity distributions is quite limited due to the intrinsic176Lu radiation emitted from the scintillators. To visualize very low activities,176Lu background needs to be reduced or removed. This study proposes a classification method to select background coincidences from true coincidences arising from the source by supervised learning using the optimal classifier as determined by investigating 5 different classifiers: logistic regression, support vector machine, random forest, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and deep neural network. Five energy and time-of-flight (TOF) related features from each coincidence event are extracted to form the training and test set in the classification. The proposed method was verified on a pair of TOF-PET detector modules. Since the measured source coincidences cannot be differentiated from the background events experimentally, simulated source coincidences are used to train the classification model. The simulated feature spectra are therefore compared with those obtained from measurement to verify the feasibility of classifying measured coincidences using a model learned by simulation. XGBoost classifier performed most effectively in classifying the coincidences and provided impressively high classification accuracy (>99%). It was subsequently tested by imaging point-like source, planar Derenzo and bar phantoms with the pair of TOF-PET detectors. An 89.4% image contrast enhancement for the Derenzo phantom at an activity concentration of 100 Bq mm-2, and a 52.4% peak-to-valley ratio improvement across the area of bar phantom at a concentration of 25 Bq mm-2, were observed on the reconstructed images with XGBoost classification applied. The proposed method could extend the usage of Lu-based PET scanners to very low activity detection and imaging and has the potential to be used in a variety of molecular imaging tasks to detect low-level signals.

TITLE: PET quantification performance of the oversize-volume-of-interest approach in the context of tumour dosimetry in radionuclide therapy planning

AUTHORS: Noah Hammersen, Walter Jentzen, Florian Stawitzki, Ken Herrmann, David Kersting, Pedro Fragoso Costa, Alexandros Moraitis

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Objective.The partial-volume effect (PVE) is an important factor impairing tumour quantification in molecular imaging. The commonly used contour-volume-of-interest (contour-VOI) approach to correct for this effect employs phantom-based recovery coefficients. Applying oversize-VOIs could offer superior quantification accuracy in small lesions. The oversize-VOI approach uses a large oversize volume to determine the total tumour activity after applying a background correction. Aims of this study were to provide a procedure for the application of the oversize-VOI approach and to compare its performance to the contour-VOI approach in PET imaging.Approach.A sphere tumour model was simulated to determine the oversize diameter that contained 90%, 95%, and 98% of the total activity as a function of the tumour size. Experimental investigations involving phantom and clinical data were conducted on a digital PET/CT scanner. In the phantom investigation, 12 spherical tumour inserts (diameters ranging from 3.7 to 37.4 mm) containing18F-solution were used. The accuracy of the contour- and oversize-VOI approach was evaluated for different signal-to-background ratios (20-3). Clinically, both approaches were applied on PET/CT images acquired with18F-labelled prostate-specific membrane antigen in prostate cancer patients.Main results.From the tumour model, we deduced that an oversize-VOI of two PET spatial resolutions larger than the physical lesion diameter contains at least 98% of the total activity for lesions with diameters down to one PET spatial resolution, while minimizing the background contribution. Both approaches were robust against varying phantom and clinical imaging conditions. Performance of the oversize-VOI approach was favorable for lesions below 10 mm in diameter, whereas the contour-VOI approach was slightly more accurate for sizes above 10 mm.Significance.The oversize-VOI approach facilitates image quantification of small tumours. It is simple and effective to correct for the PVE and may be used in pre-therapeutic (small) tumour dosimetry.

TITLE: Deep Learning-Powered CT-Less Multitracer Organ Segmentation From PET Images: A Solution for Unreliable CT Segmentation in PET/CT Imaging

AUTHORS: Yazdan Salimi, Zahra Mansouri, Isaac Shiri, Ismini Mainta, Habib Zaidi

JOURNAL: Clinical nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: The common approach for organ segmentation in hybrid imaging relies on coregistered CT (CTAC) images. This method, however, presents several limitations in real clinical workflows where mismatch between PET and CT images are very common. Moreover, low-dose CTAC images have poor quality, thus challenging the segmentation task. Recent advances in CT-less PET imaging further highlight the necessity for an effective PET organ segmentation pipeline that does not rely on CT images. Therefore, the goal of this study was to develop a CT-less multitracer PET segmentation framework.

Patients and methods: We collected 2062 PET/CT images from multiple scanners. The patients were injected with either 18 F-FDG (1487) or 68 Ga-PSMA (575). PET/CT images with any kind of mismatch between PET and CT images were detected through visual assessment and excluded from our study. Multiple organs were delineated on CT components using previously trained in-house developed nnU-Net models. The segmentation masks were resampled to coregistered PET images and used to train 4 different deep learning models using different images as input, including noncorrected PET (PET-NC) and attenuation and scatter-corrected PET (PET-ASC) for 18 F-FDG (tasks 1 and 2, respectively using 22 organs) and PET-NC and PET-ASC for 68 Ga tracers (tasks 3 and 4, respectively, using 15 organs). The models' performance was evaluated in terms of Dice coefficient, Jaccard index, and segment volume difference.

Results: The average Dice coefficient over all organs was 0.81 ± 0.15, 0.82 ± 0.14, 0.77 ± 0.17, and 0.79 ± 0.16 for tasks 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. PET-ASC models outperformed PET-NC models ( P < 0.05) for most of organs. The highest Dice values were achieved for the brain (0.93 to 0.96 in all 4 tasks), whereas the lowest values were achieved for small organs, such as the adrenal glands. The trained models showed robust performance on dynamic noisy images as well.

Conclusions: Deep learning models allow high-performance multiorgan segmentation for 2 popular PET tracers without the use of CT information. These models may tackle the limitations of using CT segmentation in PET/CT image quantification, kinetic modeling, radiomics analysis, dosimetry, or any other tasks that require organ segmentation masks.

TITLE: Development of the quantitative PET prostate phantom (Q3P) for improved quality assurance of 18F-PSMA PET imaging in metastatic prostate cancer

AUTHORS: Roberto Fedrigo, Robin Coope, Arman Rahmim, François Bénard, Carlos F Uribe

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Background: Phantoms are commonly used to evaluate and compare the performance of imaging systems given the known ground truth. Positron emission tomography (PET) scanners are routinely validated using the NEMA image quality phantom, in which lesions are modeled using 10 to 37 mm fillable spheres. The NEMA phantom neglects, however, to model focal (3-10-mm), high-uptake lesions that are increasingly observed in prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET images. PSMA-targeting radiopharmaceuticals allow for enhanced detection of metastatic prostate cancers. As such, there is significant need to develop an updated phantom which considers both the quantitative and lesion detectability of this new paradigm in oncological PET imaging.

Purpose: In this work, we present the Quantitative PET Prostate Phantom (Q3P); a portable and modular phantom that can be used to improve and harmonize imaging protocols for18F-PSMA PET scans.

Methods: A one-piece cylindrical phantom was designed effectively in two halves, which we call modules. Module 1 was designed to mimic lesions in the presence of background, and Module 2 mimicked very high contrast conditions (i.e., very low background) that can be observed in18F-PSMA PET scans. Shell-less radioactive spheres (3-16-mm) were cast using epoxy resin mixed with sodium-22 (22Na), a long half-life positron emitter with positron range similar to18F. To establish realistic lesion contrast, the22Na spheres were mounted in a cylindrical chamber that can be filled with an18F background (module 1). Thirteen exchangeable spherical cavity inserts (3-37-mm) were machined in two parts and solvent welded together, and filled with18F (50 kBq/mL) to model lesions with very high contrast (module 2). Five 2.5-min PET scans were acquired on a 5-ring GE Discovery MI PET/CT scanner (General Electric, USA). Lesions were segmented using 41% of SUVmaxfixed thresholding (41% FT) and recovery coefficients (RCs) were computed from 5 noise realizations.

Results: The manufactured phantom is portable (5.7 kg) and scan preparation takes less than 40 min. The total22Na activity is 250 kBq, allowing it to be shipped as an exempt package under International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) regulations. Recovery coefficients, computed using PSF modeling and no post-reconstruction smoothing, were 130.3% (16 mm), 147.1% (10 mm), 87.2% (6 mm), and 7.0% (3 mm) for RCmax, which decreased to 91.1% (16 mm), 90.6% (10 mm), 53.2% (6 mm), and 3.6% (3 mm) for RCmeanin the22Na spheres. Comparatively,18F sphere recovery was 110.7% (17 mm), 123.6% (10 mm), 106.5% (7 mm), and 23.3% (3 mm) for RCmax, which was reduced to 76.7% (17 mm), 77.7% (10 mm), 66.8% (7 mm), and 13.5% (3 mm), for RCmean.

Conclusions: A standardized imaging phantom was developed for lesion quantification assessment in18F-PSMA PET images. The phantom is configurable, providing users with the opportunity to modify background activity levels or sphere sizes according to clinical demands. Distributed to the community, the Q3P phantom has the potential to enable better assessment of lesion quantification and harmonization of18F-PSMA PET imaging, which may lead to more robust predictive metrics and better outcome prediction in metastatic prostate cancer.

JOURNAL: Physica medica : PM : an international journal devoted to the applications of physics to medicine and biology : official journal of the Italian Association of Biomedical Physics (AIFB)

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: This work set out to propose an attention-based deep neural network to predict partial volume corrected images from PET data not utilizing anatomical information.

Methods: An attention-based convolutional neural network (ATB-Net) is developed to predict PVE-corrected images in brain PET imaging by concentrating on anatomical areas of the brain. The performance of the deep neural network for performing PVC without using anatomical images was evaluated for two PVC methods, including iterative Yang (IY) and reblurred Van-Cittert (RVC) approaches. The RVC and IY PVC approaches were applied to PET images to generate the reference images. The training of the U-Net network for the partial volume correction was trained twice, once without using the attention module and once with the attention module concentrating on the anatomical brain regions.

Results: Regarding the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index (SSIM), and root mean square error (RMSE) metrics, the proposed ATB-Net outperformed the standard U-Net model (without attention compartment). For the RVC technique, the ATB-Net performed just marginally better than the U-Net; however, for the IY method, which is a region-wise method, the attention-based approach resulted in a substantial improvement. The mean absolute relative SUV difference and mean absolute relative bias improved by 38.02 % and 91.60 % for the RVC method and 77.47 % and 79.68 % for the IY method when using the ATB-Net model, respectively.

Conclusions: Our results propose that without using anatomical data, the attention-based DL model could perform PVC on PET images, which could be employed for PVC in PET imaging.

TITLE: Efficient Strike Artifact Reduction Based on 3D-Morphological Structure Operators from Filtered Back-Projection PET Images

AUTHORS: Chun-Yi Chiu, Yung-Hui Huang, Wei-Chang Du, Chi-Yuan Wang, Huei-Yong Chen, Yun-Shiuan Shiu, Nan-Han Lu, Tai-Been Chen

JOURNAL: Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Positron emission tomography (PET) can provide functional images and identify abnormal metabolic regions of the whole-body to effectively detect tumor presence and distribution. The filtered back-projection (FBP) algorithm is one of the most common images reconstruction methods. However, it will generate strike artifacts on the reconstructed image and affect the clinical diagnosis of lesions. Past studies have shown reduction in strike artifacts and improvement in quality of images by two-dimensional morphological structure operators (2D-MSO). The morphological structure method merely processes the noise distribution of 2D space and never considers the noise distribution of 3D space. This study was designed to develop three-dimensional-morphological structure operators (3D MSO) for nuclear medicine imaging and effectively eliminating strike artifacts without reducing image quality. A parallel operation was also used to calculate the minimum background standard deviation of the images for three-dimensional morphological structure operators with the optimal response curve (3D-MSO/ORC). As a result of Jaszczak phantom and rat verification, 3D-MSO/ORC showed better denoising performance and image quality than the 2D-MSO method. Thus, 3D MSO/ORC with a 3 × 3 × 3 mask can reduce noise efficiently and provide stability in FBP images.

TITLE: A data-driven respiratory motion estimation approach for PET based on time-of-flight weighted positron emission particle tracking

AUTHORS: Tasmia Rahman Tumpa, Shelley N Acuff, Jens Gregor, Sanghyeb Lee, Dongming Hu, Dustin R Osborne

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Respiratory motion of patients during positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) imaging affects both image quality and quantitative accuracy. Hardware-based motion estimation, which is the current clinical standard, requires initial setup, maintenance, and calibration of the equipment, and can be associated with patient discomfort. Data-driven techniques are an active area of research with limited exploration into lesion-specific motion estimation. This paper introduces a time-of-flight (TOF)-weighted positron emission particle tracking (PEPT) algorithm that facilitates lesion-specific respiratory motion estimation from raw listmode PET data.

Methods: The TOF-PEPT algorithm was implemented and investigated under different scenarios: (a) a phantom study with a point source and an Anzai band for respiratory motion tracking; (b) a phantom study with a point source only, no Anzai band; (c) two clinical studies with point sources and the Anzai band; (d) two clinical studies with point sources only, no Anzai band; and (e) two clinical studies using lesions/internal regions instead of point sources and no Anzai band. For studies with radioactive point sources, they were placed on patients during PET/CT imaging. The motion tracking was performed using a preselected region of interest (ROI), manually drawn around point sources or lesions on reconstructed images. The extracted motion signals were compared with the Anzai band when applicable. For the purposes of additional comparison, a center-of-mass (COM) algorithm was implemented both with and without the use of TOF information. Using the motion estimate from each method, amplitude-based gating was applied, and gated images were reconstructed.

Results: The TOF-PEPT algorithm is shown to successfully determine the respiratory motion for both phantom and clinical studies. The derived motion signals correlated well with the Anzai band; correlation coefficients of 0.99 and 0.94-0.97 were obtained for the phantom study and the clinical studies, respectively. TOF-PEPT was found to be 13-38% better correlated with the Anzai results than the COM methods. Maximum Standardized Uptake Values (SUVs) were used to quantitatively compare the reconstructed-gated images. In comparison with the ungated image, a 14-39% increase in the max SUV across several lesion areas and an 8.7% increase in the max SUV on the tracked lesion area were observed in the gated images based on TOF-PEPT. The distinct presence of lesions with reduced blurring effect and generally sharper images were readily apparent in all clinical studies. In addition, max SUVs were found to be 4-10% higher in the TOF-PEPT-based gated images than in those based on Anzai and COM methods.

Conclusion: A PEPT- based algorithm has been presented for determining movement due to respiratory motion during PET/CT imaging. Gating based on the motion estimate is shown to quantifiably improve the image quality in both a controlled point source phantom study and in clinical data patient studies. The algorithm has the potential to facilitate true motion correction where the reconstruction algorithm can use all data available.

TITLE: Exploring and Exploiting Multi-Modality Uncertainty for Tumor Segmentation on PET/CT

AUTHORS: Susu Kang, Yixiong Kang, Shan Tan

JOURNAL: IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Despite the success of deep learning methods in multi-modality segmentation tasks, they typically produce a deterministic output, neglecting the underlying uncertainty. The absence of uncertainty could lead to over-confident predictions with catastrophic consequences, particularly in safety-critical clinical applications. Recently, uncertainty estimation has attracted increasing attention, offering a measure of confidence associated with machine decisions. Nonetheless, existing uncertainty estimation approaches primarily focus on single-modality networks, leaving the uncertainty of multi-modality networks a largely under-explored domain. In this study, we present the first exploration of multi-modality uncertainties in the context of tumor segmentation on PET/CT. Concretely, we assessed four well-established uncertainty estimation approaches across various dimensions, including segmentation performance, uncertainty quality, comparison to single-modality uncertainties, and correlation to the contradictory information between modalities. Through qualitative and quantitative analyses, we gained valuable insights into what benefits multi-modality uncertainties derive, what information multi-modality uncertainties capture, and how multi-modality uncertainties correlate to information from single modalities. Drawing from these insights, we introduced a novel uncertainty-driven loss, which incentivized the network to effectively utilize the complementary information between modalities. The proposed approach outperformed the backbone network by 4.53 and 2.92 Dices in percentages on two PET/CT datasets while achieving lower uncertainties. This study not only advanced the comprehension of multi-modality uncertainties but also revealed the potential benefit of incorporating them into the segmentation network.

TITLE: Early detection of plant leaf diseases using stacking hybrid learning

AUTHORS: Abdullah Sheneamer

JOURNAL: PloS one

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
The early identification of pests and diseases in crops now presents a significant challenge. Different methods have been used to resolve this problem. Sticky traps and black light traps, used to identify diseases and for field monitoring, are examples of a manual procedure for analysing the diseases. A lot of time is required, and it is less effective to manually inspect larger crop fields manually. To serve requires a professional, so it is, therefore, costly. The use of sticky traps, where by bugs stick to the material upon contact, is one method of disease monitoring. A camera is used to take a picture of the sticky trap. From the picture using the average disease count, this image is then processed to ascertain the pet density for a specific time period. Such manual methods, as well as providing an effective outcome also pose a danger to the environment. This is because farmers spray pesticides in large quantities as a preventative measure. Various approaches have been used to identify diseases, including image processing and sophisticated algorithms. The most effective method of disease identification from crops is automatic detection using methods of image processing and classification algorithms for the diseases to be categorised based on different picture attributes. With a stacking stacking hybrid learning with scratch and transfer learning strategies, which is utilised in this work, a model that has already been trained is used to learn on images of diverse fruit plant leaves from the Plant Village dataset, spanning both safe samples and various illnesses. This reasearch paper used ensemble CNN and we achieved accuracy between 99.75% to 100%.

TITLE: The quantification of PET-CT radiotracers to determine minimal scan time using quadratic formulation

AUTHORS: Mohamad Aminudin Said, Marianie Musarudin, Nur Farahiyah Zulkaffli

JOURNAL: Annals of nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Objective: 18F is the most extensively used radioisotope in current clinical practices of PET imaging. This selection is based on the several criteria of pure PET radioisotopes with an optimum half-life, and low positron energy that contributes to a smaller positron range. In addition to18F, other radioisotopes such as68Ga and124I are currently gained much attention with the increase in interest in new PET tracers entering the clinical trials. This study aims to determine the minimal scan time per bed position (Tmin) for the124I and68Ga based on the quantitative differences in PET imaging of68Ga and124I relative to18F.

Methods: The European Association of Nuclear Medicine (EANM) procedure guidelines version 2.0 for FDG-PET tumor imaging has adhered for this purpose. A NEMA2012/IEC2008 phantom was filled with tumor to background ratio of 10:1 with the activity concentration of 30 kBq/ml ± 10 and 3 kBq/ml ± 10% for each radioisotope. The phantom was scanned using different acquisition times per bed position (1, 5, 7, 10 and 15 min) to determine the Tmin. The definition of Tminwas performed using an image coefficient of variations (COV) of 15%.

Results: Tminobtained for18F,68Ga and124I were 3.08, 3.24 and 32.93 min, respectively. Quantitative analyses among18F,68Ga and124I images were performed. Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), contrast recovery coefficients (CRC), and visibility (VH) are the image quality parameters analysed in this study. Generally,68Ga and18F gave better image quality as compared to124I for all the parameters studied.

Conclusion: We have defined Tminfor18F,68Ga and124I SPECT CT imaging based on NEMA2012/IEC2008 phantom imaging. Despite the long scanning time suggested by Tmin, improvement in the image quality is acquired especially for124I. In clinical practice, the long acquisition time, nevertheless, may cause patient discomfort and motion artifact.

AUTHORS: Gunnam Suryanarayana, Satyanarayana Murthy Nimmagadda, Sabbavarapu Nageswara Rao, Ali Mohammed Y Mahnashi, Shri Ramtej Kondamuri, Abdullah Ali Hussain Ahmadini, Abdullah Ahmed Zaagan, Ahmed Hussein Msmali

JOURNAL: PloS one

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
In the field of oncology imaging, the fusion of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) modalities is crucial for enhancing diagnostic capabilities. This article introduces a novel fusion method that leverages the strengths of both modalities to overcome limitations associated with functional information in MRI and the spatial resolution in PET scans. Our approach integrates the Laplacian pyramid for extracting high and low-frequency components, along with empirical mode decomposition and phase congruency to preserve crucial structural details in the fused image. Additionally, a rolling guidance filter is employed to mitigate edge detail loss. Through extensive comparative experiments on multi-focus and multi-modal image datasets, our method consistently outperforms existing techniques in terms of visualization, objective metrics, and computational efficiency. The proposed fusion method demonstrates superior performance, establishing it as a compelling alternative for oncology imaging applications.

AUTHORS: P M C C Encarnação, P M M Correia, A L M Silva, F M Ribeiro, I F Castro, J F C A Veloso

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Objective.a new projector, orthogonal-distance ray-tracer varying-full width at half maximum (OD-RT-VF), was developed to model a shift-variant elliptical point-spread function (PSF) response to improve the image quality (IQ) of a preclinical dual-rotation PET system.Approach.the OD-RT-VF projector models different FWHM values of the PSF in multiple directions, using half-height and half-width tube-of-response (ToR) values. The OD-RT-VF method's performance was evaluated against the original OD-RT method and a ToR model with constant response. The evaluation involved simulations of NEMA NU 4-2008 IQ and Derenzo phantoms, as well as a real mouse injected with [18F]-NaF scanned with the easyPET.3D system.Main results.the OD-RT-VF method demonstrated superior image resolution and uniformity (11.9% vs 15.9%) compared to the OD-RT model. In micro-derenzo phantom simulations, it resolved rods down to 1.0 mm, outperforming the other methods. For IQ phantom simulations, the OD-RT-VF projector at convergency achieved hot rods recovery coefficients ranging from 22.4% to 93.3% and lower spillover ratios in cold regions of 0.22 and 0.33 for air and water, respectively. For bone radiotracer imaging, OD-RT-VF produced clearer images of major skeletal parts, with less noise compared to OD-RT and better resolution compared to ToR projectors.Significance.the study shows that the OD-RT-VF projector method enhances PET imaging by providing better resolution, uniformity, and IQ. This model, in addition to a list-mode and GPU-based reconstruction addressing the data sparsity of dual-rotation PET geometries, unlocks their imaging potential for small animal imaging.

TITLE: Estimation of simultaneous BOLD and dynamic FDG metabolic brain activations using a multimodality concatenated ICA (mcICA) method

AUTHORS: Shenpeng Li, Sharna D Jamadar, Phillip G D Ward, Gary F Egan, Zhaolin Chen

JOURNAL: NeuroImage

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Simultaneous magnetic resonance and positron emission tomography provides an opportunity to measure brain haemodynamics and metabolism in a single scan session, and to identify brain activations from multimodal measurements in response to external stimulation. However, there are few analysis methods available for jointly analysing the simultaneously acquired blood-oxygen-level dependant functional MRI (fMRI) and 18-F-fluorodeoxyglucose functional PET (fPET) datasets. In this work, we propose a new multimodality concatenated ICA (mcICA) method to identify joint fMRI-fPET brain activations in response to a visual stimulation task. The mcICA method produces a fused map from the multimodal datasets with equal contributions of information from both modalities, measured by entropy. We validated the method in silico, and applied it to an in vivo visual stimulation experiment. The mcICA method estimated the activated brain regions in the visual cortex modulated by both BOLD and FDG signals. The mcICA provides a fully data-driven analysis approach to analyse cerebral haemodynamic response and glucose uptake signals arising from exogenously induced neuronal activity.

ABSTRACT:
Objective.The efficient usage of prompt photons like Cherenkov emission is of great interest for the design of the next generation, cost-effective, and ultra-high-sensitivity time-of-flight positron emission tomography (TOF-PET) scanners. With custom, high power consuming, readout electronics and fast digitization the prospect of sub-300 ps FWHM with PET-sized BGO crystals have been shown. However, these results are not scalable to a full system consisting of thousands of detector elements.Approach.To pave the way toward a full TOF-PET scanner, we examine the performance of the FastIC ASIC with Cherenkov-emitting scintillators (BGO), together with one of the most recent SiPM detector developments based on metal trenching from FBK. The FastIC is a highly configurable ASIC with 8 input channels, a power consumption of 12 mW ch-1and excellent linearity on the energy measurement. To put the timing performance of the FastIC into perspective, comparison measurements with high-power consuming readout electronics are performed.Main results.We achieve a best CTR FWHM of 330 ps for 2 × 2 × 3 mm3and 490 ps for 2 × 2 × 20 mm3BGO crystals with the FastIC. In addition, using 20 mm long LSO:Ce:Ca crystals, CTR values of 129 ps FWHM have been measured with the FastIC, only slightly worse to the state-of-the-art of 95 ps obtained with discrete HF electronics.Significance.For the first time, the timing capability of BGO with a scalable ASIC has been evaluated. The findings underscore the potential of the FastIC ASIC in the development of cost-effective TOF-PET scanners with excellent timing characteristics.

ABSTRACT:
Background: Long-axis positron emission tomography (PET) has emerged as one of the recent research directions in PET due to its ability to significantly enhance sensitivity and counting performance for low-dose imaging, rapid imaging, and whole-body dynamic imaging.

Purpose: The PET system presented in this study is a long-axis animal PET based on lutetium-yttrium orthosilicate and silicon photomultiplier, designed for whole-body imaging in rats. It features a diameter of 143 mm and an axial length of 213.3 mm. This study evaluated the performance of this PET system in accordance with the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) NU 4-2008 standards.

Methods: The performance evaluation was conducted according to the NEMA NU 4-2008 standards in terms of spatial resolution, sensitivity, counting rate performance, scatter fraction (SF) and image quality. In addition, a rat imaging study was conducted to assess the imaging capability of this PET system.

Results: The average energy resolution of the PET system was 12.87%, the average coincidence timing resolution was 751 ps. The FWHM of spatial resolution reconstructed by filtered back projection and 3D-OSEM-PSF algorithm at 5 mm radial offset from the axial center were 1.65 and 0.88 mm. The peak absolute sensitivity measured by a point source at the center of the field of view was evaluated as 6.71% (361-661 keV) and 10.31% (250-750 keV). For the mouse-like phantom, the SF was 11.0% and the peak noise equivalent counting rate (NECR) was 1193 kcps at 94.2 MBq (2.54 mCi). For the rat-like phantom, the SF was 26.8% and the NECR was 682.5 kcps at 78.6 MBq (2.12 mCi).

Conclusions: The performance measurement results demonstrate that this PET system exhibits high sensitivity and count rate performance, making it potential for high-quality whole-body dynamic imaging of rats.

TITLE: Evaluation of deep learning-based scatter correction on a long-axial field-of-view PET scanner

AUTHORS: Baptiste Laurent, Alexandre Bousse, Thibaut Merlin, Axel Rominger, Kuangyu Shi, Dimitris Visvikis

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Objective: Long-axial field-of-view (LAFOV) positron emission tomography (PET) systems allow higher sensitivity, with an increased number of detected lines of response induced by a larger angle of acceptance. However this extended angle increases the number of multiple scatters and the scatter contribution within oblique planes. As scattering affects both quality and quantification of the reconstructed image, it is crucial to correct this effect with more accurate methods than the state-of-the-art single scatter simulation (SSS) that can reach its limits with such an extended field-of-view (FOV). In this work, which is an extension of our previous assessment of deep learning-based scatter estimation (DLSE) carried out on a conventional PET system, we aim to evaluate the DLSE method performance on LAFOV total-body PET.

Approach: The proposed DLSE method based on an convolutional neural network (CNN) U-Net architecture uses emission and attenuation sinograms to estimate scatter sinogram. The network was trained from Monte-Carlo (MC) simulations of XCAT phantoms [F]-FDG PET acquisitions using a Siemens Biograph Vision Quadra scanner model, with multiple morphologies and dose distributions. We firstly evaluated the method performance on simulated data in both sinogram and image domain by comparing it to the MC ground truth and SSS scatter sinograms. We then tested the method on seven [F]-FDG and [F]-PSMA clinical datasets, and compare it to SSS estimations.

Results: DLSE showed superior accuracy on phantom data, greater robustness to patient size and dose variations compared to SSS, and better lesion contrast recovery. It also yielded promising clinical results, improving lesion contrasts in [F]-FDG datasets and performing consistently with [F]-PSMA datasets despite no training with [F]-PSMA.

Significance: LAFOV PET scatter can be accurately estimated from raw data using the proposed DLSE method.

TITLE: Synthesis of Prospective Multiple Time Points F-18 FDG PET Images from a Single Scan Using a Supervised Generative Adversarial Network

AUTHORS: Merhnoosh Karimipourfard, Sedigheh Sina, Fereshteh Khodadai Shoshtari, Mehrsadat Alavi

JOURNAL: Nuklearmedizin. Nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
The cumulative activity map estimation are essential tools for patient specific dosimetry with high accuracy, which is estimated using biokinetic models instead of patient dynamic data or the number of static PET scans, owing to economical and time-consuming points of view. In the era of deep learning applications in medicine, the pix-to-pix (p2 p) GAN neural networks play a significant role in image translation between imaging modalities. In this pilot study, we extended the p2 p GAN networks to generate PET images of patients at different times according to a 60 min scan time after the injection of F-18 FDG. In this regard, the study was conducted in two sections: phantom and patient studies. In the phantom study section, the SSIM, PSNR, and MSE metric results of the generated images varied from 0.98-0.99, 31-34 and 1-2 respectively and the fine-tuned Resnet-50 network classified the different timing images with high performance. In the patient study, these values varied from 0.88-0.93, 36-41 and 1.7-2.2, respectively and the classification network classified the generated images in the true group with high accuracy. The results of phantom studies showed high values of evaluation metrics owing to ideal image quality conditions. However, in the patient study, promising results were achieved which showed that the image quality and training data number affected the network performance. This study aims to assess the feasibility of p2 p GAN network application for different timing image generation.

TITLE: Perfusion weighted imaging using combined gradient/spin echo EPIK: Brain tumour applications in hybrid MR-PET

AUTHORS: N Jon Shah, Nuno André da Silva, Seong Dae Yun

JOURNAL: Human brain mapping

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Advanced perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI) methods that combine gradient echo (GE) and spin echo (SE) data are important tools for the study of brain tumours. In PWI, single-shot, EPI-based methods have been widely used due to their relatively high imaging speed. However, when used with increasing spatial resolution, single-shot EPI methods often show limitations in whole-brain coverage for multi-contrast applications. To overcome this limitation, this work employs a new version of EPI with keyhole (EPIK) to provide five echoes: two with GEs, two with mixed GESE and one with SE; the sequence is termed "GESE-EPIK." The performance of GESE-EPIK is evaluated against its nearest relative, EPI, in terms of the temporal signal-to-noise ratio (tSNR). Here, data from brain tumour patients were acquired using a hybrid 3T MR-BrainPET scanner. GESE-EPIK resulted in reduced susceptibility artefacts, shorter TEs for the five echoes and increased brain coverage when compared to EPI. Moreover, compared to EPI, EPIK achieved a comparable tSNR for the first and second echoes and significantly higher tSNR for other echoes. A new method to obtain multi-echo GE and SE data with shorter TEs and increased brain coverage is demonstrated. As proposed here, the workflow can be shortened and the integration of multimodal clinical MR-PET studies can be facilitated.

TITLE: A novel model-based equation for size dependent mean recovery coefficients for spheres and other shapes

AUTHORS: Robin de Nijs

JOURNAL: Physica medica : PM : an international journal devoted to the applications of physics to medicine and biology : official journal of the Italian Association of Biomedical Physics (AIFB)

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Background: In NM-imaging, theoretical curves for the recovery coefficient (RC) of the signal maximum and mean are known for spheres and cubes, if a 3D Gaussian PSF is assumed. The RC of the maximum is also known for cylinders. For these and other shapes empirical equations with one or two fit-parameters have been utilized.

Methods: An equation for the RC for large objects of arbitrary shape is derived and generalized into an empirical equation for smaller objects, which is verified by numerical simulations. The proposed equation is compared to published results on SPECT kidney phantom measurements and to PET measurements on the NEMA IEC PET body phantom with six spheres.

Results: The signal loss (1-RC) for large spheres is inversely proportional to the radius, where the slope is proportional to the FWHM of the spatial resolution. For non-spherical shapes the generalized instead of the volume equivalent radius should be utilized. For smaller objects, an equation with one added empirical fit-parameter is presented. It is demonstrated that the EANM-guidelines' two-parameter logistic function results in a poor fit if the theoretical slope and inverse proportionality are forced and it gives a suboptimal fit when both parameters are fitted.

Conclusions: A novel model-based equation for the mean RC-curve is derived. It can be used for arbitrary shapes as long as the sphericity is taken into account and it is accurate down to RC = 10 %. One parameter is directly related to the spatial resolution, while the other is a shape depending fit-parameter.

TITLE: Accuracy of metabolic volume and total glycolysis among six threshold-based target segmentation algorithms

AUTHORS: Tetsu Nakaichi, Shozo Yamashita, Wataru Kawakami, Haruki Yamamoto, Masayuki Sasaki, Kunihiko Yokoyama

JOURNAL: Annals of nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of six threshold-based segmentation methods with different target-to-background ratios (TBR), images with different voxel sizes and image noise, in measuring metabolic volume (MV) and total glycolysis (TG).

Methods: A standard body phantom consisting of six spheres (inner diameters of 37, 28, 22, 17, 13, and 10 mm) was filled with18F-FDG solution. The background radioactivity level was 2.65 kBq/mL, and the TBRs were 4 and 8. PET data were acquired for 30 min with list mode. PET data for 30 and 3 min were reconstructed with a three-dimensional ordered subset expectation maximization algorithm plus time-of-flight information with images with 2 and 4 mm isotropic voxels. The six methods examined were absolute standardized uptake value (SUV) of 2.5 (SUV2.5), 41%, 50%, adaptive 41%, and adaptive 50% thresholds of maximum SUV (Th41, Th50, ThA41, and ThA50, respectively); and the contrast-oriented algorithm (ThCOA). Segmented MV and TG were compared with the actual inner volume and expressed as percentages (%MVsegand %TGseg, respectively). In addition, the segmented MV was converted to the diameter, and the differences of it from the reference diameter were compared among six methods.

Results: The ThCOAmethod yielded the most accurate measurements of %MVsegand %TGseg; the difference between %MVsegor %TGsegand its reference were smaller than 10% in 30-min and 15% in 3-min images, but the segmented contour was almost the same as the reference diameter. Measurements with Th50and ThCOAwere highly accurate for both %MVsegand %TGsegin the large spheres, and the adaptive threshold methods, including ThA41, ThA50, and ThCOA,were also highly accurate in the small spheres. The voxel sizes affected the accuracy of %MVsegand %TGsegwith a TBR of 4 in any threshold-based methods.

Conclusions: Of the six threshold-based segmentation methods studied, ThCOAwas the most accurate method for evaluating MV and TG and had only minor dependence on TBRs and sphere size. The small voxel sizes improved the variation of the accuracy in low TBR.

TITLE: Decay Correction for Quantitative Myocardial PET Perfusion in Established PET Scanners: A Potentially Overlooked Source of Errors

AUTHORS: Robert Bober

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear medicine technology

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Quantitative myocardial PET perfusion requires decay correction (DC) of the dynamic datasets to ensure that measured activity reflects true physiology and not radiotracer decay or frame duration. DC is typically performed by the PET camera system, and the exact algorithm is buried within the settings and assumed to be correct for quantitative perfusion data. For quantitative myocardial perfusion, sequential dynamic images should be decay-corrected to the activity at the midpoint of the first scan in the sequence. However, there are different DC algorithms that can be implemented depending on the needs and expertise of the laboratory. As such, before quantitative myocardial perfusion is performed, the DC technique of a camera system should be tested.

AUTHORS: Hongyan Tang, Zhenxing Huang, Wenbo Li, Yaping Wu, Jianmin Yuan, Yang Yang, Yan Zhang, Jing Qin, Hairong Zheng, Dong Liang, Meiyun Wang, Zhanli Hu

JOURNAL: IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
The precise segmentation of different brain regions and tissues is usually a prerequisite for the detection and diagnosis of various neurological disorders in neuroscience. Considering the abundance of functional and structural dual-modality information for positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance (PET/MR) images, we propose a novel 3D whole-brain segmentation network with a cross-fusion mechanism introduced to obtain 45 brain regions. Specifically, the network processes PET and MR images simultaneously, employing UX-Net and a cross-fusion block for feature extraction and fusion in the encoder. We test our method by comparing it with other deep learning-based methods, including 3DUXNET, SwinUNETR, UNETR, nnFormer, UNet3D, NestedUNet, ResUNet, and VNet. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves better segmentation performance in terms of both visual and quantitative evaluation metrics and achieves more precise segmentation in three views while preserving fine details. In particular, the proposed method achieves superior quantitative results, with a Dice coefficient of 85.73% 0.01%, a Jaccard index of 76.68% 0.02%, a sensitivity of 85.00% 0.01%, a precision of 83.26% 0.03% and a Hausdorff distance (HD) of 4.4885 14.85%. Moreover, the distribution and correlation of the SUV in the volume of interest (VOI) are also evaluated (PCC > 0.9), indicating consistency with the ground truth and the superiority of the proposed method. In future work, we will utilize our whole-brain segmentation method in clinical practice to assist doctors in accurately diagnosing and treating brain diseases.

TITLE: Optimization and impact of sensitivity mode on abbreviated scan protocols with population-based input function for parametric imaging of [18F]-FDG for a long axial FOV PET scanner

AUTHORS: W Lan, H Sari, A Rominger, C la Fougère, F P Schmidt

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Background: The long axial field of view, combined with the high sensitivity of the Biograph Vision Quadra PET/CT scanner enables the precise deviation of an image derived input function (IDIF) required for parametric imaging. Traditionally, this requires an hour-long dynamic PET scan for [18F]-FDG, which can be significantly reduced by using a population-based input function (PBIF). In this study, we expand these examinations and include the scanner's ultra-high sensitivity (UHS) mode in comparison to the high sensitivity (HS) mode and evaluate the potential for further shortening of the scan time.

Methods: Patlak Kiand DV estimates were determined by the indirect and direct Patlak methods using dynamic [18F]-FDG data of 6 oncological patients with 26 lesions (0-65 min p.i.). Both sensitivity modes for different number/duration of PET data frames were compared, together with the potential of using abbreviated scan durations of 20, 15 and 10 min by using a PBIF. The differences in parametric images and tumour-to-background ratio (TBR) due to the shorter scans using the PBIF method and between the sensitivity modes were assessed.

Results: A difference of 3.4 ± 7.0% (Ki) and 1.2 ± 2.6% (DV) was found between both sensitivity modes using indirect Patlak and the full IDIF (0-65 min). For the abbreviated protocols and indirect Patlak, the UHS mode resulted in a lower bias and higher precision, e.g., 45-65 min p.i. 3.8 ± 4.4% (UHS) and 6.4 ± 8.9% (HS), allowing shorter scan protocols, e.g. 50-65 min p.i. 4.4 ± 11.2% (UHS) instead of 7.3 ± 20.0% (HS). The variation of Kiand DV estimates for both Patlak methods was comparable, e.g., UHS mode 3.8 ± 4.4% and 2.7 ± 3.4% (Ki) and 14.4 ± 2.7% and 18.1 ± 7.5% (DV) for indirect and direct Patlak, respectively. Only a minor impact of the number of Patlak frames was observed for both sensitivity modes and Patlak methods. The TBR obtained with direct Patlak and PBIF was not affected by the sensitivity mode, was higher than that derived from the SUV image (6.2 ± 3.1) and degraded from 20.2 ± 12.0 (20 min) to 10.6 ± 5.4 (15 min). Kiand DV estimate images showed good agreement (UHS mode, RC: 6.9 ± 2.3% (Ki), 0.1 ± 3.1% (DV), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR): 64.5 ± 3.3 dB (Ki), 61.2 ± 10.6 dB (DV)) even for abbreviated scan protocols of 50-65 min p.i.

Conclusions: Both sensitivity modes provide comparable results for the full 65 min dynamic scans and abbreviated scans using the direct Patlak reconstruction method, with good Kiand DV estimates for 15 min short scans. For the indirect Patlak approach the UHS mode improved the Kiestimates for the abbreviated scans.

TITLE: GAN-based synthetic FDG PET images from T1 brain MRI can serve to improve performance of deep unsupervised anomaly detection models

AUTHORS: Daria Zotova, Nicolas Pinon, Robin Trombetta, Romain Bouet, Julien Jung, Carole Lartizien

JOURNAL: Computer methods and programs in biomedicine

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Background and objective: Research in the cross-modal medical image translation domain has been very productive over the past few years in tackling the scarce availability of large curated multi-modality datasets with the promising performance of GAN-based architectures. However, only a few of these studies assessed task-based related performance of these synthetic data, especially for the training of deep models.

Methods: We design and compare different GAN-based frameworks for generating synthetic brain[18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET images from T1 weighted MRI data. We first perform standard qualitative and quantitative visual quality evaluation. Then, we explore further impact of using these fake PET data in the training of a deep unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) model designed to detect subtle epilepsy lesions in T1 MRI and FDG PET images. We introduce novel diagnostic task-oriented quality metrics of the synthetic FDG PET data tailored to our unsupervised detection task, then use these fake data to train a use case UAD model combining a deep representation learning based on siamese autoencoders with a OC-SVM density support estimation model. This model is trained on normal subjects only and allows the detection of any variation from the pattern of the normal population. We compare the detection performance of models trained on 35 paired real MR T1 of normal subjects paired either on 35 true PET images or on 35 synthetic PET images generated from the best performing generative models. Performance analysis is conducted on 17 exams of epilepsy patients undergoing surgery.

Results: The best performing GAN-based models allow generating realistic fake PET images of control subject with SSIM and PSNR values around 0.9 and 23.8, respectively and in distribution (ID) with regard to the true control dataset. The best UAD model trained on these synthetic normative PET data allows reaching 74% sensitivity.

Conclusion: Our results confirm that GAN-based models are the best suited for MR T1 to FDG PET translation, outperforming transformer or diffusion models. We also demonstrate the diagnostic value of these synthetic data for the training of UAD models and evaluation on clinical exams of epilepsy patients. Our code and the normative image dataset are available.

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Objective.To develop and validate a novel multidimensional readout method that significantly reduces the number of readout channels (NRC) in PET detectors while maintaining high spatial and energy performance.Approach.We arranged a3×3×4SiPM array in multiple dimensions and employed row/column/layer summation with a resistor-based splitting circuit. We then applied denoising methods to enhance the peak-to-valley ratio in the decoding map, ensuring accurate crystal-position determination. Additionally, we investigated the system's energy response at 511 keV and evaluated the suitability for both clinical and research PET systems.Main results.The proposed multidimensional readout method achieved a favorable multiplexing ratio, lowering the total NRCs without compromising energy resolution at 511 keV. Our tests demonstrated that a SiPM bias voltage of 31 V effectively balances gain and saturation effects, resulting in reliable energy measurements.Significance.By reducing system complexity, cost, and power consumption, the multidimensional readout method presents a practical alternative to conventional readout schemes for PET and other large-scale sensor arrays. Additionally, the approach can manage simultaneous multi-layer hits by arranging detector layers and, when needed, uses ICS detection to correct for scatter events. Its adaptable architecture allows scaling to higher dimensions for broader applications (e.g. SPECT, CT, LiDAR). These features make it a valuable contribution toward more efficient, high-performance imaging technologies in both clinical and industrial settings.

TITLE: Preclinical Positron Emission Tomography with Body Conforming Animal Molds for Cloud-Based Automated Image Analysis in Mice

AUTHORS: Edward Cabral, Mary Katherine Montgomery, Meaghan Berg, Lisa Kathryn Manzuk, Anand Giddabasappa, Ziyue Karen Jiang

JOURNAL: Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a molecular imaging modality that can be used to investigate a multitude of pharmacological questions, such as biomarker modulation, receptor occupancy, and biodistribution of compounds of interest. In biodistribution studies, experimental subjects are often longitudinally imaged after receiving the test article. The images are then analyzed to derive the compound's distribution profile in various organs at different timepoints. This constitutes a crucial step in drug development to understand the distribution and potentially binding profile of an investigative compound. Standard/manual methods of PET imaging-based biodistribution analyses, however, are labor-intensive and time-consuming and are often associated with high inter-operator variability. Further, it is challenging to keep the animals' positions consistent across different timepoints. To address these shortcomings, a series of mouse Body Conforming Animal Molds (BCAMs) were used to enable rigid and consistent positioning of animals during PET/CT imaging acquisition. Further, a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform consisting of a cloud-based Organ Probability Map (OPM) and an artificial intelligence-powered segmentation tool were employed to enable reliable and automated quantitation of in vivo PET imaging data. The workflow presented here includes (1) prepping mice for imaging with the BCAMs, including the proper implantation of subcutaneous tumors to be compatible with the molds, (2) acquiring PET/CT images with BCAMs using the G8 scanner, and 3) performing automated organ segmentation and biodistribution analysis using the cloud-based SaaS. [18F]FDG was used as an exemplar tracer here, but other biomarkers and/or radio-labeled compounds can be readily adapted into the workflow. This procedure can be executed accurately and effectively with minimal training, and the automated PET data analysis yielded satisfactory results consistent with the manual method.

TITLE: A novel multimodel medical image fusion framework with edge enhancement and cross-scale transformer

AUTHORS: Fei Luo, Daoqi Wu, Luis Rojas Pino, Weichao Ding

JOURNAL: Scientific reports

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Multimodal medical image fusion (MMIF) integrates complementary information from different imaging modalities to enhance image quality and remove redundant data, benefiting a variety of clinical applications such as tumor detection and organ delineation. However, existing MMIF methods often struggle to preserve sharp edges and maintain high contrast, both of which are critical for accurate diagnosis and treatment planning. To address these limitations, this paper proposes ECFusion, a novel MMIF framework that explicitly incorporates edge prior information and leverages a cross-scale transformer. First, an Edge-Augmented Module (EAM) employs the Sobel operator to extract edge features, thereby improving the representation and preservation of edge details. Second, a Cross-Scale Transformer Fusion Module (CSTF) with a Hierarchical Cross-Scale Embedding Layer (HCEL) captures multi-scale contextual information and enhances the global consistency of fused images. Additionally, a multi-path fusion strategy is introduced to disentangle deep and shallow features, mitigating feature loss during fusion. We conduct extensive experiments on the AANLIB dataset, evaluating CT-MRI, PET-MRI, and SPECT-MRI fusion tasks. Compared with state-of-the-art methods (U2Fusion, EMFusion, SwinFusion, and CDDFuse), ECFusion produces fused images with clearer edges and higher contrast. Quantitative results further highlight improvements in mutual information (MI), structural similarity (Qabf, SSIM), and visual perception (VIF, Qcb, Qcv).

TITLE: DGCBG-Net: A dual-branch network with global cross-modal interaction and boundary guidance for tumor segmentation in PET/CT images

AUTHORS: Ziwei Zou, Beiji Zou, Xiaoyan Kui, Zhi Chen, Yang Li

JOURNAL: Computer methods and programs in biomedicine

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Background and objectives: Automatic tumor segmentation plays a crucial role in cancer diagnosis and treatment planning. Computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography (PET) are extensively employed for their complementary medical information. However, existing methods ignore bilateral cross-modal interaction of global features during feature extraction, and they underutilize multi-stage tumor boundary features.

Methods: To address these limitations, we propose a dual-branch tumor segmentation network based on global cross-modal interaction and boundary guidance in PET/CT images (DGCBG-Net). DGCBG-Net consists of 1) a global cross-modal interaction module that extracts global contextual information from PET/CT images and promotes bilateral cross-modal interaction of global feature; 2) a shared multi-path downsampling module that learns complementary features from PET/CT modalities to mitigate the impact of misleading features and decrease the loss of discriminative features during downsampling; 3) a boundary prior-guided branch that extracts potential boundary features from CT images at multiple stages, assisting the semantic segmentation branch in improving the accuracy of tumor boundary segmentation.

Results: Extensive experiments are conducted on STS and Hecktor 2022 datasets to evaluate the proposed method. The average Dice scores of our DGCB-Net on the two datasets are 80.33% and 79.29%, with average IOU scores of 67.64% and 70.18%. DGCB-Net outperformed the current state-of-the-art methods with a 1.77% higher Dice score and a 2.12% higher IOU score.

Conclusions: Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DGCBG-Net outperforms existing segmentation methods, and is competitive to state-of-arts.

ABSTRACT:
Quantitative molecular imaging with PET can offer insights into physiologic and pathologic processes and is widely used for studying brain disorders. The NeuroEXPLORER is a recently developed dedicated brain PET system offering high spatial resolution and high sensitivity with an extended axial length. This study evaluated the quantitative precision and accuracy of the NeuroEXPLORER with phantom and human data for a variety of imaging conditions that are relevant to dynamic neuroimaging studies.Methods:Thirty-minute scans of an image quality (IQ) phantom and a 3-dimensional Hoffman brain phantom filled with [18F]FDG were performed over 13 h, covering phantom activities of 1.3-177 MBq. Furthermore, a uniform cylindric phantom filled with 558 MBq of11C was scanned for 4 h. Quantitative accuracy was assessed using the contrast recovery coefficient (CRC), background variability, and background bias in the IQ phantom, the recovery coefficients (RCs) in the Hoffman phantom, and the bias in the uniform phantom. Results were compared at delayed time points, with different reconstruction parameters and frame lengths down to 1 s. Moreover, randomly subsampled frames of 2 imaging time points (0-2 min and 60-90 min) from a dynamic scan of a healthy volunteer with a 177-MBq injected dose of (R)-4-(3-fluoro-5-(fluoro-18F)phenyl)-1-((3-methylpyridin-4-yl)methyl)pyrrolidin-2-one ([18F]SynVesT-1) were used to assess quantification of brain uptake and image-derived input function extraction.Results:Negligible effects were observed on CRC and background bias with 3-177 MBq in the IQ phantom, and bias was less than 5% with 1-558 MBq in the uniform phantom. RC variations were within ±1% with 2-169 MBq in the Hoffman phantom, showcasing the system's high spatial resolution and high sensitivity. Short-frame reconstructions of the 60- to 90-min healthy-volunteer scan showed a ±1% mean difference in quantification of brain uptake for frame lengths down to 30 s and demonstrated the feasibility of measuring image-derived input function with mean absolute differences below 10% for frame lengths down to 1 s.Conclusion:The NeuroEXPLORER, with its high detection sensitivity, maintains high precision and accuracy across a wide range of imaging conditions beyond those evaluated in standard performance tests. These results demonstrate its potential for quantitative neuroimaging applications.

TITLE: Improving depth-of-interaction resolution in pixellated PET detectors using neural networks

AUTHORS: Artem Zatcepin, Marco Pizzichemi, Andrea Polesel, Marco Paganoni, Etiennette Auffray, Sibylle I Ziegler, Negar Omidvari

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Parallax error is a common issue in high-resolution preclinical positron emission tomography (PET) scanners as well as in clinical scanners that have a long axial field of view (FOV), which increases estimation uncertainty of the annihilation position and therefore degrades the spatial resolution. A way to address this issue is depth-of-interaction (DOI) estimation. In this work we propose two machine learning-based algorithms, a dense and a convolutional neural network (NN), as well as a multiple linear regression (MLR)-based method to estimate DOI in depolished PET detector arrays with single-sided readout. The algorithms were tested on an 8× 8 array of 1.53× 1.53× 15 mm3crystals and a 4× 4 array of 3.1× 3.1× 15 mm3crystals, both made of Ce:LYSO scintillators and coupled to a 4× 4 array of 3× 3 mm3silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs). Using the conventional linear DOI estimation method resulted in an average DOI resolution of 3.76 mm and 3.51 mm FWHM for the 8× 8 and the 4× 4 arrays, respectively. Application of MLR outperformed the conventional method with average DOI resolutions of 3.25 mm and 3.33 mm FWHM, respectively. Using the machine learning approaches further improved the DOI resolution, to an average DOI resolution of 2.99 mm and 3.14 mm FWHM, respectively, and additionally improved the uniformity of the DOI resolution in both arrays. Lastly, preliminary results obtained by using only a section of the crystal array for training showed that the NN-based methods could be used to reduce the number of calibration steps required for each detector array.

TITLE: On the partial volume effect in magnetic particle imaging

AUTHORS: Hayden J Good, Toby Sanders, Andrii Melnyk, A Rahman Mohtasebzadeh, Eric Daniel Imhoff, Patrick Goodwill, Carlos M Rinaldi-Ramos

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Objective.Magnetic particle imaging (MPI) is an emerging tomographic 'hot spot' imaging modality with potential to visualize superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticle tracer distributions with high sensitivity and quantitative accuracy. MPI shares many similarities with positron emission tomography (PET), where the partial volume effect (PVE) can result in signal under- and over-quantification due to spill-over of signal arising from limited resolution. While the PVE has been alluded to in the MPI literature it has not been previously studied nor characterized. The objective of this study was to systematically characterize this PVE in MPI.Approach.This contribution characterizes the PVE using models of varying size and shape filled with a uniform concentration of tracer. The effect of object size on signal distribution was analyzed after application of a new image post-processing filter.Main results.As object size increased, signal distribution increased to a maximum signal value independent of object geometry and proportional to tracer concentration. Furthermore, for small objects with characteristic dimensions below the resolution of the tracer at the scanning conditions used, signal suppression was observed. These results are consistent with foundational observations of PVE in PET, suggesting that approaches to overcome the PVE in PET may be applicable to MPI.Significance.This finding has significant impact on the MPI field by demonstrating the presence of the PVE phenomenon that can directly influence imaging results.

TITLE: Total-Body PET System Designs with Axial and Transverse Gaps: A Study of Lesion Quantification and Detectability

AUTHORS: Min Gao, Margaret E Daube-Witherspoon, Joel S Karp, Suleman Surti

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
High-sensitivity total-body PET enables faster scans, lower doses, and dynamic multiorgan imaging. However, the higher system cost of a scanner with a long axial field of view (AFOV) hinders its wider application. This paper investigates the impact on the lesion quantification and detectability of cost-effective total-body PET sparse designs.Methods:Using the PennPET Explorer (PPEx) as a model, 3 sparse configurations with the same 142-cm AFOV were considered, including designs with only axial gaps (AGs), only transverse gaps (TGs), and a mixture of AGs and TGs (MG), with retained detector fractions (DFs) ranging from 71% to 40%. Human data from the PPEx were used to emulate sparse designs by discarding lines of response as a proxy for missing detectors. We embedded lesion events in the resultant list data with varying uptakes in the lung and liver before reconstruction. A generalized scan statistics methodology was used to measure lesion detectability and quantification as a function of lesion uptake and scan duration.Results:Relative to a fully populated system, an AG design with 71% performs well but is susceptible to image artifacts as the DF decreases to 58%. A TG design performs well with a DF of 58% but requires twice the scan time to achieve similar lesion detectability and is susceptible to transverse field-of-view truncation below 60 cm as the DF is further decreased. An MG design with a DF of 58% requires 3 times the scan time to achieve similar lesion detectability, and with no evidence of artifacts even as the DF is decreased to 40%.Conclusion:Sparse designs with artifact-free images can provide comparable lesion quantification and detectability to the fully populated PPEx after compensating for the reduced sensitivity with increased scan time. Because an AG design is more susceptible to image artifacts with a lower DF, a system with only AGs is not an optimal choice for dramatic cost reduction. A TG design provides a higher relative sensitivity than AG or MG designs for a given DF, leading to a shorter scan time to achieve comparable lesion detectability. However, the increased truncation of the transverse field of view with decreasing DF limits this design choice. An MG design allows for the greatest cost reduction (lowest DF) if the scan duration is increased to compensate for the higher loss in sensitivity. Sparse designs of PET with a long AFOV provide a technologic solution for introducing such systems at reduced cost into routine clinical use.

TITLE: Tumor volume-adapted SUVN as an alternative to SUVpeak for quantification of small lesions in PET/CT imaging: a proof-of-concept study

AUTHORS: Mohammad Amin Mosleh-Shirazi, Zahra Nasiri-Feshani, Pardis Ghafarian, Mehrosadat Alavi, Gholamhasan Haddadi, Ali Ketabi

JOURNAL: Japanese journal of radiology

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: SUVpeakis a recommended quantification metric except for small lesions. We aimed to assess the averaged standard uptake value (SUVN) as an alternative to SUVpeakfor small-lesion quantification.

Materials and methods: NEMA-like phantom images were reconstructed using OSEM, OSEM + PSF, OSEM + TOF and OSEM + TOF + PSF with two post-smoothing Gaussian filters for different background activity levels. SUVmax, SUVN(N = 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35 or 40 hottest voxels), and SUVpeak, relative percent error, contrast recovery, and volume recovery coefficients were quantified and assessed.

Results: SUVNdid not have the limitations of SUVpeakfor smaller lesions. In the smallest insert at 2.68 kBq/ml, optimum N values for OSEM, OSEM + PSF, OSEM + TOF and OSEM + TOF + PSF were 10, 5, 15, and 10 for SUVN, respectively. The same N values were obtained for metabolic tumor volumes (MTVs) for all reconstruction algorithms. At 5.30 kBq/ml, N = 5 was optimum for SUVNand MTVs. For the larger inserts, the optimum N increased and tended towards the maximum (similar to SUVpeak).

Conclusions: SUVNis more accurate than SUVmaxor SUVpeakfor small lesions, while being as accurate in larger ones. This harmonizing capacity of SUVNcan be beneficial for the quantitative analysis of small tumor volumes.

TITLE: Regularized origin ensemble with a beam prior for range verification in particle therapy with Compton-camera data

AUTHORS: Jona Kasprzak, Jorge Roser, Julius Werner, Nadja Kohlhase, Andreas Bolke, Lisa-Marie Kaufmann, Magdalena Rafecas

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Objective. In particle therapy (PT), several methods are being investigated to help reduce range margins and identify deviations from the original treatment plan, such as prompt-gamma imaging with Compton cameras (CC). To reconstruct the images, the Origin Ensemble (OE) algorithm is commonly used. In the context of PT, artifacts and strong noise often affect CC images. To improve the ability of OE to identify range shifts, and also to enhance image quality, we propose to regularize OE using beam a-priori knowledge (beam prior).Approach. We implemented the beam prior to OE using the class of Gibbs' distribution functions. For evaluation, Monte-Carlo simulations of centered and off-center beams with therapeutic energies impinging on a PMMA target were conducted in GATE. To introduce range shifts, air layers were introduced into the target. In addition, the effect of a bone layer, closer to a realistic scenario, was investigated. OE with the beam prior (BP-OE) and conventional OE (reference) were compared using the spill-over-ratio (SOR) as well as shifts in the distal falloff in projections using cubic splines with Chebyshev nodes.Main results. BP-OE improved the shift estimates by up to 11% compared to conventional OE for centered and up to 250% with off-centered beams. BP-OE decreased the image noise level, improving the SOR significantly by up to 96%.Significance. BP-OE applied to CC data can improve shift estimations compared to conventional OE. The developed Gibbs-based regularization framework also allows further prior functions to be included into OE, for instance, smoothing or edge-preserving priors. BP-OE could be extended to PET-based range verification or multiple-beam scenarios.

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Objective.Modern PET scanners offer precise TOF information, improving the SNR of the reconstructed images. Timing calibrations are performed to reduce the worsening effects of the system components and provide valuable TOF information. Traditional calibration procedures often provide static or linear corrections, with the drawback that higher-order skews or event-to-event corrections are not addressed. Novel research demonstrated significant improvements in the reachable timing resolutions when combining conventional calibration approaches with machine learning, with the disadvantage of extensive calibration times infeasible for a clinical application. In this work, we made the first steps towards an in-system application and analyzed the effects of varying data sparsity on a machine learning timing calibration, aiming to accelerate the calibration time. Furthermore, we demonstrated the versatility of our calibration concept by applying the procedure for the first time to analog readout technology.Approach.We modified experimentally acquired calibration data used for training regarding their statistical and spatial sparsity, mimicking reduced measurement time and variability of the training data. Trained models were tested on unseen test data, characterized by fine spatial sampling and rich statistics. In total, 80 decision tree models with the same hyperparameter settings, were trained and holistically evaluated regarding data scientific, physics-based, and PET-based quality criteria.Main results.The calibration procedure can be heavily reduced from several days to some minutes without sacrificing quality and still significantly improving the timing resolution from(304±5)psto(216±1)pscompared to conventionally used analytical calibration methods.Significance.This work serves as the first step in making the developed machine learning-based calibration suitable for an in-system application to profit from the method's capabilities on the system level. Furthermore, this work demonstrates the functionality of the methodology on detectors using analog readout technology. The proposed holistic evaluation criteria here serve as a guideline for future evaluations of machine learning-based calibration approaches.

TITLE: Calculation of recovery coefficients for partial volume effect correction in PET/CT imaging using a customized anthropomorphic body phantom

AUTHORS: Gunes Yavuz, Bilal Kovan, Turkay Toklu, Tevfik F Çermik, Cengizhan Öztürk

JOURNAL: Biomedical engineering online

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (PET/CT) combines metabolic and anatomical information improving the precision and accuracy of oncological diagnostics. The standardized uptake value (SUV) measures tumor metabolism, yet its accuracy is influenced by the partial volume effect (PVE), impacting small lesion detection. This study aims to refine PVE corrections for small lesions using an in-house customized, special anthropomorphic phantom. Scans of this phantom which contained spheres of different sizes were performed across four hospitals at different PET/CT systems from various manufacturers (Siemens and Philips analog PET/CT systems, GE analog and digital PET/CT systems). The phantom contained six custom-designed cylinders with embedded spheres simulating sub-centimeter (0.3, 0.5, 0.9) and centimeter (1.3, 1.9, 2.8) lesions. Scans were performed separately for each sphere in the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis regions at all sites. Recovery Coefficients (RCs) were calculated to correct SUV values, demonstrating that RCs vary by sphere size and anatomical region but not change significantly among scanners. RCs are approaching unity for larger spheres, ensuring accurate SUV measurements. However, small spheres (< 0.5 cm) exhibited significant measurement challenges due to PVE. The anthropomorphic phantom proved effective in obtaining realistic SUV-corrected values, offering a promising tool for enhancing the accuracy and standardization of PET imaging in oncology. This study underscores the necessity for advanced imaging technologies and standardized RC application in clinical settings to improve the quantification of PET imaging, particularly in small lesion detection.

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear cardiology : official publication of the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Background: Attenuation artifacts affect the analysis of single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging, especially in the right coronary artery (RCA) territory, although computed tomography (CT)-based attenuation corrections minimize this issue. This study aims to assess stress-rest [99mTc]sestamibi cadmium zinc telluride (CZT)-SPECT reconstructed using deep-learning-based attenuation correction (DLAC) maps according to coronary artery territory and with comparison to [82Rb]rubidium-positron emission tomography (Rb-PET) conventionally reconstructed with CT-based attenuation correction.

Methods: We compared stress-rest [99mTc]sestamibi CZT-SPECT reconstructed without (i.e., standard (SD-SPECT)) and with DLAC (DLAC-SPECT) in 84 patients at risk of attenuation artifacts (overweight individuals and women) with no previous history of coronary artery disease (CAD), and who also had Rb-PET and, when indicated, coronary angiography.

Results: In 74 very low CAD-risk patients: (i) the stress segmental activity values were homogeneous between the three coronary artery territories with DLAC-SPECT and Rb-PET but exhibited a marked reduction in the RCA territory with SD-SPECT (69.1% ± 8.2% vs 81.2% ± 7.1% and 77.7% ± 8.5% for DLAC-SPECT and Rb-PET, respectively, both P < .001), and (ii) the absolute value of the difference between the rest and stress segmental activities was higher in the RCA territory with SD-SPECT (5.13% ± 4.04%) than with DLAC-SPECT (4.21% ± 3.24%) and Rb-PET (3.92% ± 3.08%, both P < .001).

Conclusions: When utilizing DLAC maps for reconstruction of [99mTc]sestamibi CZT-SPECT, there is no more drop in the RCA territory uptake with lower fluctuations in stress-to-rest activity, aligning closely with the results observed using Rb-PET in the same patients.

TITLE: Algorithms to reduce the edge effect and improve the flood histogram quality of a PET detector consisting of two pixelated crystal arrays

AUTHORS: Longhan Cong, Zhonghua Kuang, Ning Ren, Ziru Sang, Zheng Liu, Ming Niu, Siwei Xie, Qiyu Peng, Yongfeng Yang

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: The performance of detectors is key for a PET scanner to achieve high spatial resolution and high sensitivity. This work aims to develop flood histogram generating algorithms to reduce the edge effect and improve the crystal identification of a PET detector consisting of two optically coupled pixelated scintillator detectors.

Methods: The PET detector consists of two optically coupled detectors, each consisting of a 23×23 LYSO crystal array with a crystal size of 1.0×1.0×20 mm3read out by an 8×8 SiPM array with a pixel size of 3.0×3.0 mm2. The SiPM array is read out with a resistor network circuit to obtain four position encoding energy signals. A novel center of gravity (COG) positioning algorithm using six signals from the two detectors was proposed and compared to the traditional COG algorithms using either four or eight signals from the detectors. The raised-to-the-power (RTP) method was applied to the three COG algorithms for the PET detector. Different powers of the RTP from 1.0 to 2.5 were evaluated.

Results: The proposed COG algorithm significantly improves the crystal identification at the junction of the two detectors as compared to the COG algorithm using four signals of each detector, and improves the crystal identification at the center of the two detectors as compared to the COG algorithm using eight signals from both detectors. The RTP method significantly improves the overall flood histogram qualities of the two COG algorithms using either eight or six signals from the two detectors, and the two COG algorithm provide similar flood histogram quality when a power of 1.5 is used.

Conclusion: The novel positioning algorithms reduce the edge effect and improve the flood histogram quality for a PET detector consisting of two optically coupled detectors, each consisting of a pixelated scintillator crystal array and a SiPM array with highly multiplexed four signal readout. The positioning algorithms can be used in a PET scanner to improve the spatial resolution and sensitivity.

TITLE: Experimental validation of a coincidence time resolution metric including depth-of-interaction bias for TOF-PET

AUTHORS: Francis Loignon-Houle, Maxime Toussaint, Min Sun Lee, Joshua W Cates, Roger Lecomte

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Depth-of-interaction (DOI) variability of annihilation photons is known to be a source of coincidence time resolution (CTR) degradation for fast time-of-flight-positron emission tomography detectors. An analytical model was recently proposed to explicitly include the DOI time bias separately from variance-related statistical factors, such as scintillation photon emission and photosensor jitter, in the CTR evaluation. In the present work, an experimental validation of this new model is provided. An unconventional signal readout configuration was used to magnify the DOI bias with 20 mm long LYSO:Ce crystals. In a head-to-head orientation of the crystals, simulations performed using the metric with DOI bias exhibited a much better agreement (within 21 ps) with the experimentally measured CTR of 413 ± 8 ps full-width at half maximum, whereas simulations without DOI bias underestimated the CTR by 138 ps. The metric including DOI bias was shown to also be effective at predicting the CTR of the head-to-head setup (without DOI information) using data from a DOI-collimated experimental setup (with partial DOI information). With the development of new low-variance ultra-fast detectors, the DOI timing blur will become increasingly important and will need to be taken into account in analytical predictions and in some experimental measurements through the proposed metric.

TITLE: From code sharing to sharing of implementations: Advancing reproducible AI development for medical imaging through federated testing

AUTHORS: Fereshteh Yousefirizi, Annudesh Liyanage, Ivan S Klyuzhin, Arman Rahmim

JOURNAL: Journal of medical imaging and radiation sciences

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Background: The reproducibility crisis in AI research remains a significant concern. While code sharing has been acknowledged as a step toward addressing this issue, our focus extends beyond this paradigm. In this work, we explore "federated testing" as an avenue for advancing reproducible AI research and development especially in medical imaging. Unlike federated learning, where a model is developed and refined on data from different centers, federated testing involves models developed by one team being deployed and evaluated by others, addressing reproducibility across various implementations.

Methods: Our study follows an exploratory design aimed at systematically evaluating the sources of discrepancies in shared model execution for medical imaging and outputs on the same input data, independent of generalizability analysis. We distributed the same model code to multiple independent centers, monitoring execution in different runtime environments while considering various real-world scenarios for pre- and post-processing steps. We analyzed deployment infrastructure by comparing the impact of different computational resources (GPU vs. CPU) on model performance. To assess federated testing in AI models for medical imaging, we performed a comparative evaluation across different centers, each with distinct pre- and post-processing steps and deployment environments, specifically targeting AI-driven positron emission tomography (PET) imaging segmentation. More specifically, we studied federated testing for an AI-based model for surrogate total metabolic tumor volume (sTMTV) segmentation in PET imaging: the AI algorithm, trained on maximum intensity projection (MIP) data, segments lymphoma regions and estimates sTMTV.

Results: Our study reveals that relying solely on open-source code sharing does not guarantee reproducible results due to variations in code execution, runtime environments, and incomplete input specifications. Deploying the segmentation model on local and virtual GPUs compared to using Docker containers showed no effect on reproducibility. However, significant sources of variability were found in data preparation and pre-/post- processing techniques for PET imaging. These findings underscore the limitations of code sharing alone in achieving consistent and accurate results in federated testing.

Conclusion: Achieving consistently precise results in federated testing requires more than just sharing models through open-source code. Comprehensive pipeline sharing, including pre- and post-processing steps, is essential. Cloud-based platforms that automate these processes can streamline AI model testing across diverse locations. Standardizing protocols and sharing complete pipelines can significantly enhance the robustness and reproducibility of AI models.

TITLE: Optimizing positron emission tomography for accurate plant imaging using Monte Carlo simulations to correct positron range effects

AUTHORS: Rahal Saaidi, Yahya Tayalati, Abdelouahed El Fatimy

JOURNAL: Scientific reports

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a valuable tool for plant imaging, but its accuracy can be compromised by positron range effects. This study improves PET accuracy using the GATE Monte Carlo simulation tool to estimate and correct these effects. The GATE model was validated for the Siemens Biograph Vision system using the NEMA NU 2-2018 protocol, showing alignment with experimental data. Deviations were within 9% for sensitivity and 3% for peak Noise Equivalent Count Rate (NECR). Different isotopes (18F,11C,15O, and30P) and plant phantom properties were analyzed for their impact on reconstructed images. A sixfold enhancement was observed for15O and a threefold improvement for11C when a magnetic field was applied to the plant phantom. Our findings suggest that integrating PET with magnetic resonance imaging can help address Positron range effects in plant imaging. This study provides valuable insights into PET imaging and offers refined methodologies for clinical and plant-centric research. Our research validates the use of GATE Monte Carlo simulation for Biograph Vision and advances our understanding of Positron range phenomena and potential mitigation strategies for precise PET Plant imaging.

TITLE: A backprojection kernel (KRNL3D) for very-wide-aperture 3D tomography applied to PET with Multigrid for precise use of time-of-flight data

AUTHORS: Keith Miller

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
In 'KRNL3D' we derive a kernel functionK(y1,y2,φ) whose backprojections from all directions (θ,φ) in the spherical band∣φ∣<φ¯maxon the celestial sphere, when integrated with respect to solid angle, yieldρ, the 3D Gaussian point response function (PRF) of radius 1. ThisK, when convolved against line integral data from an unknown density functionf, yields an integral formula for the 'mollification'ff=ρ∗f, which is a slightly blurred version off, and which stabilizes the mild ill-posedness. Applied to positron emission tomography that backprojection reconstruction occurs stochastically and one emission event at a time, after needed data corrections. We describe Octave (≈Matlab) codes to tabulateKand to test its use with a large apertureφ¯max=π/3orπ/6. 'KRNL3D-TOF' truncates backprojection to a cylindrical patch about the TOF approximate location of each event. These 'backplacements' decrease the computational cost and limit noise and streaking in one region from contaminating the reconstruction in more distant regions. They also retain the ability to count emission events in an isolated blob despiteverylow event counts, a valuable feature fordynamicstudies of metabolic processes. 'Multigrid' allows further reduction in the radius and lengths of the cylinders, thereby enabling even moreprecise use of the TOF information. This precision should be especially important as researchers decrease the TOF uncertainty in newer generation scanners. Finally, we discuss 'further work' that needs to be done. Our codes are being made freely available athttps://github.com/keithmillerberkeley/PET-codes.

TITLE: Deep learning techniques in PET/CT imaging: A comprehensive review from sinogram to image space

AUTHORS: Maryam Fallahpoor, Subrata Chakraborty, Biswajeet Pradhan, Oliver Faust, Prabal Datta Barua, Hossein Chegeni, Rajendra Acharya

JOURNAL: Computer methods and programs in biomedicine

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) is increasingly used in oncology, neurology, cardiology, and emerging medical fields. The success stems from the cohesive information that hybrid PET/CT imaging offers, surpassing the capabilities of individual modalities when used in isolation for different malignancies. However, manual image interpretation requires extensive disease-specific knowledge, and it is a time-consuming aspect of physicians' daily routines. Deep learning algorithms, akin to a practitioner during training, extract knowledge from images to facilitate the diagnosis process by detecting symptoms and enhancing images. This acquired knowledge aids in supporting the diagnosis process through symptom detection and image enhancement. The available review papers on PET/CT imaging have a drawback as they either included additional modalities or examined various types of AI applications. However, there has been a lack of comprehensive investigation specifically focused on the highly specific use of AI, and deep learning, on PET/CT images. This review aims to fill that gap by investigating the characteristics of approaches used in papers that employed deep learning for PET/CT imaging. Within the review, we identified 99 studies published between 2017 and 2022 that applied deep learning to PET/CT images. We also identified the best pre-processing algorithms and the most effective deep learning models reported for PET/CT while highlighting the current limitations. Our review underscores the potential of deep learning (DL) in PET/CT imaging, with successful applications in lesion detection, tumor segmentation, and disease classification in both sinogram and image spaces. Common and specific pre-processing techniques are also discussed. DL algorithms excel at extracting meaningful features, and enhancing accuracy and efficiency in diagnosis. However, limitations arise from the scarcity of annotated datasets and challenges in explainability and uncertainty. Recent DL models, such as attention-based models, generative models, multi-modal models, graph convolutional networks, and transformers, are promising for improving PET/CT studies. Additionally, radiomics has garnered attention for tumor classification and predicting patient outcomes. Ongoing research is crucial to explore new applications and improve the accuracy of DL models in this rapidly evolving field.

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Background: Total-body (TB) Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is one of the most promising medical diagnostics modalities, opening new perspectives for personalized medicine, low-dose imaging, multi-organ dynamic imaging or kinetic modeling. The high sensitivity provided by total-body technology can be advantageous for novel tomography methods like positronium imaging, demanding the registration of triple coincidences. Currently, state-of-the-art PET scanners use inorganic scintillators. However, the high acquisition cost reduces the accessibility of TB PET technology. Several efforts are ongoing to mitigate this problem. Among the alternatives, the Jagiellonian PET (J-PET) technology, based on axially arranged plastic scintillator strips, offers a low-cost alternative solution for TB PET.

Purpose: The work aimed to compare five total-body J-PET geometries with plastic scintillators suitable for multi-organ and positronium tomography as a possible next-generation J-PET scanner design.

Methods: We present comparative studies of performance characteristics of the cost-effective total-body PET scanners using J-PET technology. We investigated in silico five TB scanner geometries, varying the number of rings, scanner radii, and other parameters. Monte Carlo simulations of the anthropomorphic XCAT phantom, the extended 2-m sensitivity line source and positronium sensitivity phantoms were used to assess the performance of the geometries. Two hot spheres were placed in the lungs and in the liver of the XCAT phantom to mimic the pathological changes. We compared the sensitivity profiles and performed quantitative analysis of the reconstructed images by using quality metrics such as contrast recovery coefficient, background variability and root mean squared error. The studies are complemented by the determination of sensitivity for the positronium lifetime tomography and the relative cost analysis of the studied setups.

Results: The analysis of the reconstructed XCAT images reveals the superiority of the seven-ring scanners over the three-ring setups. However, the three-ring scanners would be approximately 2-3 times cheaper. The peak sensitivity values for two-gamma vary from 20 to 34 cps/kBq and are dominated by the differences in geometrical acceptance of the scanners. The sensitivity curves for the positronium tomography have a similar shape to the two-gamma sensitivity profiles. The peak values are lower compared to the two-gamma cases, from about 20-28 times, with a maximum value of 1.66 cps/kBq. This can be contrasted with the 50-cm one-layer J-PET modular scanner used to perform the first in-vivo positronium imaging with a sensitivity of 0.06 cps/kBq.

Conclusions: The results show the feasibility of multi-organ imaging of all the systems to be considered for the next generation of TB J-PET designs. Among the scanner parameters, the most important ones are related to the axial field-of-view coverage. The two-gamma sensitivity and XCAT image reconstruction analyzes show the advantage of seven-ring scanners. However, the cost of the scintillator materials and SiPMs is more than two times higher for the longer modalities compared to the three-ring solutions. Nevertheless, the relative cost for all the scanners is about 10-4 times lower compared to the cost of the uExplorer. These properties coupled together with J-PET cost-effectiveness and triggerless acquisition mode enabling three-gamma positronium imaging, make the J-PET technology an attractive solution for broad application in clinics.

TITLE: Improvement of image quality using amplitude-based respiratory gating in PET-computed tomography scanning

AUTHORS: Jung-Soo Kim, Chan-Rok Park, Seok-Hwan Yoon, Joo-Ah Lee, Tae-Yoon Kim, Hyung-Jin Yang

JOURNAL: Nuclear medicine communications

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Objectives: This study sought to provide data supporting the expanded clinical use of respiratory gating by assessing the diagnostic accuracy of breathing motion correction using amplitude-based respiratory gating.

Methods: A respiratory movement tracking device was attached to a PET-computed tomography scanner, and images were obtained in respiratory gating mode using a motion phantom that was capable of sensing vertical motion. Specifically, after setting amplitude changes and intervals according to the movement cycle using a total of nine combinations of three waveforms and three amplitude ranges, respiratory motion-corrected images were reconstructed using the filtered back projection method. After defining areas of interest in the acquired images in the same image planes, statistical analyses were performed to compare differences in standardized uptake value (SUV), lesion volume, full width at half maximum (FWHM), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR).

Results: SUVmax increased by 89.9%, and lesion volume decreased by 27.9%. Full width at half maximum decreased by 53.9%, signal-to-noise ratio increased by 11% and contrast-to-noise ratio increased by 16.3%. Optimal results were obtained when using a rest waveform and 35% duty cycle, in which the change in amplitude in the respiratory phase signal was low, and a constant level of long breaths was maintained.

Conclusions: These results demonstrate that respiratory-gated PET-CT imaging can be used to accurately correct for SUV changes and image distortion caused by respiratory motion, thereby providing excellent imaging information and quality.

ABSTRACT:
Positron emission tomography / computed tomography (PET/CT) plays a pivotal role in the assessment of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), particularly in the context of ischemic heart disease. Nevertheless, its application in other forms of CVD, such as infiltrative, infectious, or inflammatory conditions, remains limited. Recently, PET/CT systems with an extended axial field of view (LAFOV) have been developed, offering greater anatomical coverage and significantly enhanced PET sensitivity. These advancements enable head-to-pelvis imaging with a single bed position, and in systems with an axial field of view (FOV) of approximately 2 meters, even total body (TB) imaging is feasible in a single scan session. The application of LAFOV PET/CT in CVD presents a promising opportunity to improve systemic cardiovascular assessments and address the limitations inherent to conventional short axial field of view (SAFOV) devices. However, several technical challenges, including procedural considerations for LAFOV systems in CVD, complexities in data processing, arterial input function extraction, and artefact management, have not been fully explored. This review aims to discuss the technical aspects of LAFOV PET/CT in relation to CVD by highlighting key opportunities and challenges and examining the impact of these factors on the evaluation of most relevant CVD.

TITLE: Projection Space Implementation of Deep Learning-Guided Low-Dose Brain PET Imaging Improves Performance over Implementation in Image Space

AUTHORS: Amirhossein Sanaat, Hossein Arabi, Ismini Mainta, Valentina Garibotto, Habib Zaidi

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Our purpose was to assess the performance of full-dose (FD) PET image synthesis in both image and sinogram space from low-dose (LD) PET images and sinograms without sacrificing diagnostic quality using deep learning techniques.Methods:Clinical brain PET/CT studies of 140 patients were retrospectively used for LD-to-FD PET conversion. Five percent of the events were randomly selected from the FD list-mode PET data to simulate a realistic LD acquisition. A modified 3-dimensional U-Net model was implemented to predict FD sinograms in the projection space (PSS) and FD images in image space (PIS) from their corresponding LD sinograms and images, respectively. The quality of the predicted PET images was assessed by 2 nuclear medicine specialists using a 5-point grading scheme. Quantitative analysis using established metrics including the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index metric (SSIM), regionwise SUV bias, and first-, second- and high-order texture radiomic features in 83 brain regions for the test and evaluation datasets was also performed.Results:All PSS images were scored 4 or higher (good to excellent) by the nuclear medicine specialists. PSNR and SSIM values of 0.96 ± 0.03 and 0.97 ± 0.02, respectively, were obtained for PIS, and values of 31.70 ± 0.75 and 37.30 ± 0.71, respectively, were obtained for PSS. The average SUV bias calculated over all brain regions was 0.24% ± 0.96% and 1.05% ± 1.44% for PSS and PIS, respectively. The Bland-Altman plots reported the lowest SUV bias (0.02) and variance (95% confidence interval, -0.92 to +0.84) for PSS, compared with the reference FD images. The relative error of the homogeneity radiomic feature belonging to the gray-level cooccurrence matrix category was -1.07 ± 1.77 and 0.28 ± 1.4 for PIS and PSS, respectively.Conclusion:The qualitative assessment and quantitative analysis demonstrated that the FD PET PSS led to superior performance, resulting in higher image quality and lower SUV bias and variance than for FD PET PIS.

TITLE: Anatomy guided modality fusion for cancer segmentation in PET CT volumes and images

AUTHORS: Ibtihaj Ahmad, Sadia Jabbar Anwar, Bagh Hussain, Atiq Ur Rehman, Amine Bermak

JOURNAL: Scientific reports

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Segmentation in computed tomography (CT) provides detailed anatomical information, while positron emission tomography (PET) provide the metabolic activity of cancer. Existing segmentation models in CT and PET either rely on early fusion, which struggles to effectively capture independent features from each modality, or late fusion, which is computationally expensive and fails to leverage the complementary nature of the two modalities. This research addresses the gap by proposing an intermediate fusion approach that optimally balances the strengths of both modalities. Our method leverages anatomical features to guide the fusion process while preserving spatial representation quality. We achieve this through the separate encoding of anatomical and metabolic features followed by an attentive fusion decoder. Unlike traditional fixed normalization techniques, we introduce novel "zero layers" with learnable normalization. The proposed intermediate fusion reduces the number of filters, resulting in a lightweight model. Our approach demonstrates superior performance, achieving a dice score of 0.8184 and an [Formula: see text] score of 2.31. The implications of this study include more precise tumor delineation, leading to enhanced cancer diagnosis and more effective treatment planning.

TITLE: Eliminating CT radiation for clinical PET examination using deep learning

AUTHORS: Qingneng Li, Xiaohua Zhu, Sijuan Zou, Na Zhang, Xin Liu, Yongfeng Yang, Hairong Zheng, Dong Liang, Zhanli Hu

JOURNAL: European journal of radiology

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Clinical PET/CT examinations rely on CT modality for anatomical localization and attenuation correction of the PET data. However, the use of CT significantly increases the risk of ionizing radiation exposure for patients. We propose a deep learning framework to learn the relationship mapping between attenuation corrected (AC) PET and non-attenuation corrected (NAC) PET images to estimate PET attenuation maps and generate pseudo-CT images for medical observation. In this study, 5760, 1608 and 1351 pairs of transverse PET-CT slices were used as the training, validation, and testing sets, respectively, to implement the proposed framework. A pix2pix model was adopted to predict AC PET images from NAC PET images, which allowed the calculation of PET attenuation maps (µ-maps). The same model was then applied to generate realistic CT images from the calculated µ-maps. The quality of predicted AC PET and CT was assessed using normalized root mean square error (NRMSE), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index (SSIM) and Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC). Relative to true AC PET, the synthetic AC PET achieved superior quantitative performances with 2.20 ± 1.17% NRMSE, 34.03 ± 4.73 dB PSNR, 97.90 ± 1.22% SSIM and 98.45 ± 1.31% PCC. The synthetic CT and synthetic AC PET images were deemed acceptable by radiologists who rated the images, as they provided sufficient anatomical and functional information, respectively. This work demonstrates that the proposed deep learning framework is a promising method in clinical applications, such as radiotherapy and low-dose imaging.

TITLE: Investigating the use of machine learning to generate ventilation images from CT scans

AUTHORS: James Grover, Hilary L Byrne, Yu Sun, John Kipritidis, Paul Keall

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Background: Radiotherapy treatment planning incorporating ventilation imaging can reduce the incidence of radiation-induced lung injury. The gold-standard of ventilation imaging, using nuclear medicine, has limitations with respect to availability and cost.

Purpose: An alternative type of ventilation imaging to nuclear medicine uses 4DCT (or breath-hold CT [BHCT] pair) with deformable image registration (DIR) and a ventilation metric to produce a CT ventilation image (CTVI). The purpose of this study is to investigate the application of machine learning as an alternative to DIR-based methods when producing CTVIs.

Methods: A patient dataset of 15 inhale and exhale BHCTs and Galligas PET ventilation images were used to train and test a 2D U-Net style convolutional neural network. The neural network established relationships between axial input BHCT image pairs and axial labeled Galligas PET images and was evaluated using eightfold cross-validation. Once trained, the neural network could produce a CTVI from an input BHCT image pair. The CTVIs produced by the neural network were qualitatively assessed visually and quantitatively compared to a Galligas PET ventilation image using a Spearman correlation and Dice similarity coefficient (DSC). The DSC measured the spatial overlap between three segmented equal lung volumes by ventilation (high, medium, and low functioning lung [LFL]).

Results: The mean Spearman correlation between the CTVIs and the Galligas PET ventilation images was 0.58 ± 0.14. The mean DSC over high, medium, and LFL between the CTVIs and Galligas PET ventilation images was 0.55 ± 0.06. Visually, a systematic overprediction of ventilation within the lung was observed in the CTVIs with respect to the Galligas PET ventilation images, with jagged regions of ventilation in the sagittal and coronal planes.

Conclusions: A convolutional neural network was developed that could produce a CTVI from a BHCT image pair, which was then compared with a Galligas PET ventilation image. The performance of this machine learning method was comparable to previous benchmark studies investigating a DIR-based CTVI, warranting future development, and investigation of applying machine learning to a CTVI.

TITLE: Union is strength: the combination of radiomics features and 3D-deep learning in a sole model increases diagnostic accuracy in demented patients: a whole brain 18FDG PET-CT analysis

AUTHORS: Alberto Bestetti, Barbara Zangheri, Sara Vincenzina Gabanelli, Vincenzo Parini, Carla Fornara

JOURNAL: Nuclear medicine communications

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Objective: FDG PET imaging plays a crucial role in the evaluation of demented patients by assessing regional cerebral glucose metabolism. In recent years, both radiomics and deep learning techniques have emerged as powerful tools for extracting valuable information from medical images. This article aims to provide a comparative analysis of radiomics features, 3D-deep learning convolutional neural network (CNN) and the fusion of them, in the evaluation of 18F-FDG PET whole brain images in patients with dementia and normal controls.

Methods: 18F-FDG brain PET and clinical score were collected in 85 patients with dementia and 125 healthy controls (HC). Patients were assigned to various form of dementia on the basis of clinical evaluation, follow-up and voxels comparison with HC using a two-sample Student's t -test, to determine the regions of brain involved. Radiomics analysis was performed on the whole brain after normalization to an optimized template. After selection using the minimum redundancy maximum relevance method and Pearson's correlation coefficients, the features obtained were added to a neural network model to find the accuracy in classifying HC and demented patients. Forty subjects not included in the training were used to test the models. The results of the three models (radiomics, 3D-CNN, combined model) were compared with each other.

Results: Four radiomics features were selected. The sensitivity was 100% for the three models, but the specificity was higher with radiomics and combined one (100% vs. 85%). Moreover, the classification scores were significantly higher using the combined model in both normal and demented subjects.

Conclusion: The combination of radiomics features and 3D-CNN in a single model, applied to the whole brain 18FDG PET study, increases the accuracy in demented patients.

TITLE: MFCNet: A multi-modal fusion and calibration networks for 3D pancreas tumor segmentation on PET-CT images

AUTHORS: Fei Wang, Chao Cheng, Weiwei Cao, Zhongyi Wu, Heng Wang, Wenting Wei, Zhuangzhi Yan, Zhaobang Liu

JOURNAL: Computers in biology and medicine

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
In clinical diagnosis, positron emission tomography and computed tomography (PET-CT) images containing complementary information are fused. Tumor segmentation based on multi-modal PET-CT images is an important part of clinical diagnosis and treatment. However, the existing current PET-CT tumor segmentation methods mainly focus on positron emission tomography (PET) and computed tomography (CT) feature fusion, which weakens the specificity of the modality. In addition, the information interaction between different modal images is usually completed by simple addition or concatenation operations, but this has the disadvantage of introducing irrelevant information during the multi-modal semantic feature fusion, so effective features cannot be highlighted. To overcome this problem, this paper propose a novel Multi-modal Fusion and Calibration Networks (MFCNet) for tumor segmentation based on three-dimensional PET-CT images. First, a Multi-modal Fusion Down-sampling Block (MFDB) with a residual structure is developed. The proposed MFDB can fuse complementary features of multi-modal images while retaining the unique features of different modal images. Second, a Multi-modal Mutual Calibration Block (MMCB) based on the inception structure is designed. The MMCB can guide the network to focus on a tumor region by combining different branch decoding features using the attention mechanism and extracting multi-scale pathological features using a convolution kernel of different sizes. The proposed MFCNet is verified on both the public dataset (Head and Neck cancer) and the in-house dataset (pancreas cancer). The experimental results indicate that on the public and in-house datasets, the average Dice values of the proposed multi-modal segmentation network are 74.14% and 76.20%, while the average Hausdorff distances are 6.41 and 6.84, respectively. In addition, the experimental results show that the proposed MFCNet outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the two datasets.

TITLE: Testing the Ability of Convolutional Neural Networks to Learn Radiomic Features

AUTHORS: Ivan S Klyuzhin, Yixi Xu, Anthony Ortiz, Juan Lavista Ferres, Ghassan Hamarneh, Arman Rahmim

JOURNAL: Computer methods and programs in biomedicine

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Background and objective: Radiomics and deep learning have emerged as two distinct approaches to medical image analysis. However, their relative expressive power remains largely unknown. Theoretically, hand-crafted radiomic features represent a mere subset of features that neural networks can approximate, thus making deep learning a more powerful approach. On the other hand, automated learning of hand-crafted features may require a prohibitively large number of training samples. Here we directly test the ability of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn and predict the intensity, shape, and texture properties of tumors as defined by standardized radiomic features.

Methods: Conventional 2D and 3D CNN architectures with an increasing number of convolutional layers were trained to predict the values of 16 standardized radiomic features from real and synthetic PET images of tumors, and tested. In addition, several ImageNet-pretrained advanced networks were tested. A total of 4000 images were used for training, 500 for validation, and 500 for testing.

Results: Features quantifying size and intensity were predicted with high accuracy, while shape irregularity and heterogeneity features had very high prediction errors and generalized poorly. For example, mean normalized prediction error of tumor diameter with a 5-layer CNN was 4.23 ± 0.25, while the error for tumor sphericity was 15.64 ± 0.93. We additionally found that learning shape features required an order of magnitude more samples compared to intensity and size features.

Conclusions: Our findings imply that CNNs trained to perform various image-based clinical tasks may generally under-utilize the shape and texture information that is more easily captured by radiomics. We speculate that to improve the CNN performance, shape and texture features can be computed explicitly and added as auxiliary variables to the networks, or supplied as synthetic inputs.

TITLE: A CT-free deep-learning-based attenuation and scatter correction for copper-64 PET in different time-point scans

AUTHORS: Zahra Adeli, Seyed Abolfazl Hosseini, Yazdan Salimi, Nasim Vahidfar, Peyman Sheikhzadeh

JOURNAL: Radiological physics and technology

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
This study aimed to develop and evaluate a deep-learning model for attenuation and scatter correction in whole-body 64Cu-based PET imaging. A swinUNETR model was implemented using the MONAI framework. Whole-body PET-nonAC and PET-CTAC image pairs were used for training, where PET-nonAC served as the input and PET-CTAC as the output. Due to the limited number of Cu-based PET/CT images, a model pre-trained on 51 Ga-PSMA PET images was fine-tuned on 15 Cu-based PET images via transfer learning. The model was trained without freezing layers, adapting learned features to the Cu-based dataset. For testing, six additional Cu-based PET images were used, representing 1-h, 12-h, and 48-h time points, with two images per group. The model performed best at the 12-h time point, with an MSE of 0.002 ± 0.0004 SUV2, PSNR of 43.14 ± 0.08 dB, and SSIM of 0.981 ± 0.002. At 48 h, accuracy slightly decreased (MSE = 0.036 ± 0.034 SUV2), but image quality remained high (PSNR = 44.49 ± 1.09 dB, SSIM = 0.981 ± 0.006). At 1 h, the model also showed strong results (MSE = 0.024 ± 0.002 SUV2, PSNR = 45.89 ± 5.23 dB, SSIM = 0.984 ± 0.005), demonstrating consistency across time points. Despite the limited size of the training dataset, the use of fine-tuning from a previously pre-trained model yielded acceptable performance. The results demonstrate that the proposed deep learning model can effectively generate PET-DLAC images that closely resemble PET-CTAC images, with only minor errors.

TITLE: A Role for FDG PET Radiomics in Personalized Medicine?

AUTHORS: Gary J R Cook, Vicky Goh

JOURNAL: Seminars in nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Radiomics describes the extraction of multiple features from medical images, including molecular imaging modalities, that with bioinformatic approaches, provide additional clinically relevant information that may be invisible to the human eye. This information may complement standard radiological interpretation with data that may better characterize a disease or that may provide predictive or prognostic information. Progressing from predefined image features, often describing heterogeneity of voxel intensities within a volume of interest, there is increasing use of machine learning to classify disease characteristics and deep learning methods based on artificial neural networks that can learn features without a priori definition and without the need for preprocessing of images. There have been advances in standardization and harmonization of methods to a level that should support multicenter studies. However, in this relatively early phase of research in the field, there are limited aspects that have been adopted into routine practice. Most of the reports in the molecular imaging field describe radiomic approaches in cancer using18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG-PET). In this review, we will describe radiomics in molecular imaging and summarize the pertinent literature in lung cancer where reports are most prevalent and mature.

TITLE: Modality-Specific Segmentation Network for Lung Tumor Segmentation in PET-CT Images

AUTHORS: Dehui Xiang, Bin Zhang, Yuxuan Lu, Shengming Deng

JOURNAL: IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Lung tumor segmentation in PET-CT images plays an important role to assist physicians in clinical application to accurately diagnose and treat lung cancer. However, it is still a challenging task in medical image processing field. Due to respiration and movement, the lung tumor varies largely in PET images and CT images. Even the two images are almost simultaneously collected and registered, the shape and size of lung tumors in PET-CT images are different from each other. To address these issues, a modality-specific segmentation network (MoSNet) is proposed for lung tumor segmentation in PET-CT images. MoSNet can simultaneously segment the modality-specific lung tumor in PET images and CT images. MoSNet learns a modality-specific representation to describe the inconsistency between PET images and CT images and a modality-fused representation to encode the common feature of lung tumor in PET images and CT images. An adversarial method is proposed to minimize an approximate modality discrepancy through an adversarial objective with respect to a modality discriminator and reserve modality-common representation. This improves the representation power of the network for modality-specific lung tumor segmentation in PET images and CT images. The novelty of MoSNet is its ability to produce a modality-specific map that explicitly quantifies the modality-specific weights for the features in each modality. To demonstrate the superiority of our method, MoSNet is validated in 126 PET-CT images with NSCLC. Experimental results show that MoSNet outperforms state-of-the-art lung tumor segmentation methods.

AUTHORS: Confidence Raymond, Michael T Jurkiewicz, Akintunde Orunmuyi, Linshan Liu, Michael Oluwaseun Dada, Claes N Ladefoged, Jarmo Teuho, Udunna C Anazodo

JOURNAL: Journal of neuroradiology = Journal de neuroradiologie

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: This systematic review provides a consensus on the clinical feasibility of machine learning (ML) methods for brain PET attenuation correction (AC). Performance of ML-AC were compared to clinical standards.

Methods: Two hundred and eighty studies were identified through electronic searches of brain PET studies published between January 1, 2008, and August 1, 2022. Reported outcomes for image quality, tissue classification performance, regional and global bias were extracted to evaluate ML-AC performance. Methodological quality of included studies and the quality of evidence of analysed outcomes were assessed using QUADAS-2 and GRADE, respectively.

Results: A total of 19 studies (2371 participants) met the inclusion criteria. Overall, the global bias of ML methods was 0.76 ± 1.2%. For image quality, the relative mean square error (RMSE) was 0.20 ± 0.4 while for tissues classification, the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) for bone/soft tissue/air were 0.82 ± 0.1 / 0.95 ± 0.03 / 0.85 ± 0.14.

Conclusions: In general, ML-AC performance is within acceptable limits for clinical PET imaging. The sparse information on ML-AC robustness and its limited qualitative clinical evaluation may hinder clinical implementation in neuroimaging, especially for PET/MRI or emerging brain PET systems where standard AC approaches are not readily available.

AUTHORS: Andreas Renner, Ivo Rausch, Jacobo Cal Gonzalez, Elmar Laistler, Ewald Moser, Thies Jochimsen, Tatjana Sattler, Osama Sabri, Thomas Beyer, Michael Figl, Wolfgang Birkfellner, Bernhard Sattler

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Background: MR-based methods for attenuation correction (AC) in PET/MRI either neglect attenuation of bone, or use MR-signal derived information about bone, which leads to a bias in quantification of tracer uptake in PET. In a previous study, we presented a PET/MRI specific MR coil with an integrated transmission source (TX) system allowing for direct measurement of attenuation. In phantom measurements, this system successfully reproduced the linear attenuation coefficient of water.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to validate the TX system in a clinical setting using animals and to show its applicability compared to standard clinical methods.

Methods: As test subject, a 15-kg piglet was injected with 53 MBq of 18F-NaF. The μ-map obtained with the TX system and the reconstructed activity distribution were compared to four established AC methods: a Dixon sequence, an ultra-short echo time (UTE) sequence, a CT scan, and a 511 keV transmission scan using a Siemens ECAT EXACT HR+ as the reference. The PET/MRI measurements were performed on a Siemens Biograph mMR to obtain the μ-map using the TX system as well as the Dixon and UTE sequence directly followed by the CT and ECAT measurements.

Results: The reconstructed activity distribution using the TX system for AC showed similar results compared to the reference (<5% difference in hot regions) and outperformed the MR-based methods as implemented in the PET/MRI system (<10% difference in hot regions). However, the additional hardware of the TX system adds complexity to the acquisition process.

Conclusion: Our porcine study demonstrates the feasibility of post-injection transmission scans using the developed TX system in a clinical setting. This makes it a useful tool for PET/MRI in cases where transmission information is needed for AC. Potential applications are studies using larger animals where state-of-the-art atlas-based or artificial intelligence AC methods are not available.

JOURNAL: PET clinics

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Total-body PET image reconstruction follows a similar procedure to the image reconstruction process for standard whole-body PET scanners. One unique aspect of total-body imaging is simultaneous coverage of the entire human body, which makes it convenient to perform total-body dynamic PET scans. Therefore, four-dimensional dynamic PET reconstruction and parametric imaging are of great interest in total-body imaging. This article covers some basics of PET image reconstruction and then focuses on three- and four-dimensional PET reconstruction for total-body imaging. Methods for image formation from raw measurements in total-body PET are described. Challenges and opportunities in total-body PET image reconstruction are discussed.

TITLE: Utilizing Pix2Pix conditional generative adversarial networks to recover missing data in preclinical PET scanner sinogram gaps

AUTHORS: Zahra Karimi, Khadijeh Rezaee Ebrahim Saraee, Mohammad Reza Ay, Peyman Sheikhzadeh

JOURNAL: Physica medica : PM : an international journal devoted to the applications of physics to medicine and biology : official journal of the Italian Association of Biomedical Physics (AIFB)

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Background: The presence of a gap between adjacent detector blocks in Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scanners introduces a partial loss of projection data, which can degrade the image quality and quantitative accuracy of reconstructed PET images. This study suggests a novel approach for filling missing data from sinograms generated from preclinical PET scanners using a combination of an inpainting method and the Pix2Pix conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN).

Materials and methods: Twenty mice and Image Quality (IQ) phantom were scanned by a small animal Xtrim PET scanner, resulting in 7500 raw sinograms used for network training and test datasets. The absence of gap-free sinograms as the target for neural network training was a challenge. This issue was solved by artificially generating gap-free sinograms from the original sinogram. To assess the performance of the proposed approach, the sinograms were reconstructed using the ordered subset expectation maximization (OSEM) algorithm. The overall performance of the proposed network and the quality of the resulting images were quantitatively compared using various metrics, including the root mean squared error (RMSE), structural similarity index (SSIM), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).

Results: The Pix2Pix cGAN approach achieved an RMSE of 9.34 × 10-4± 5.7 × 10-5and an SSIM of 99.984 × 10-2± 1.8 × 10-5, considering the corresponding inpainted sinograms as the target.

Conclusion: The proposed approach can retrieve missing sinogram data by learning a map derived from the whole sinogram compared to the adjacent pixels, which leads to better quantitative accuracy and improved reconstructed images.

TITLE: Unsupervised inter-frame motion correction for whole-body dynamic PET using convolutional long short-term memory in a convolutional neural network

AUTHORS: Xueqi Guo, Bo Zhou, David Pigg, Bruce Spottiswoode, Michael E Casey, Chi Liu, Nicha C Dvornek

JOURNAL: Medical image analysis

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Subject motion in whole-body dynamic PET introduces inter-frame mismatch and seriously impacts parametric imaging. Traditional non-rigid registration methods are generally computationally intense and time-consuming. Deep learning approaches are promising in achieving high accuracy with fast speed, but have yet been investigated with consideration for tracer distribution changes or in the whole-body scope. In this work, we developed an unsupervised automatic deep learning-based framework to correct inter-frame body motion. The motion estimation network is a convolutional neural network with a combined convolutional long short-term memory layer, fully utilizing dynamic temporal features and spatial information. Our dataset contains 27 subjects each under a 90-min FDG whole-body dynamic PET scan. Evaluating performance in motion simulation studies and a 9-fold cross-validation on the human subject dataset, compared with both traditional and deep learning baselines, we demonstrated that the proposed network achieved the lowest motion prediction error, obtained superior performance in enhanced qualitative and quantitative spatial alignment between parametric Kiand Vbimages, and significantly reduced parametric fitting error. We also showed the potential of the proposed motion correction method for impacting downstream analysis of the estimated parametric images, improving the ability to distinguish malignant from benign hypermetabolic regions of interest. Once trained, the motion estimation inference time of our proposed network was around 460 times faster than the conventional registration baseline, showing its potential to be easily applied in clinical settings.

ABSTRACT:
Accurate quantification in emission tomography is essential for internal radiopharmaceutical therapy dosimetry. Mean activity concentration measurements in objects with diameters less than 10 times the full width at half maximum of the imaging system's spatial resolution are significantly affected (>10%) by the partial-volume effect. This study develops a framework for PET and SPECT spatial resolution characterization and proposes 2 MIRD recovery coefficient models-a geometric mean approximation (RECOVER-GM) and an empirical model (RECOVER-EM)-that provide shape-specific partial-volume correction (PVC). The models were validated using simulations and phantom experiments, with a comparative PVC test on ellipsoidal phantoms demonstrating that the RECOVER models significantly reduced error in activity quantification by factors of approximately 1.3-5.7 compared with conventional sphere-based corrections. The proposed recovery coefficient models and PVC methodology provide a robust framework for improved region-based PVC, including corrections for nonspherical tumor volumes. This work is part of the ongoing MIRDsoft.org project that aims to enhance accessibility to advanced dosimetry tools for improved disease characterization, treatment planning, and radiopharmaceutical therapy dosimetry.

TITLE: Metabolic Anomaly Appearance Aware U-Net for Automatic Lymphoma Segmentation in Whole-Body PET/CT Scans

AUTHORS: Tianyu Shi, Huiyan Jiang, Meng Wang, Zhaoshuo Diao, Guoxu Zhang, Yu-Dong Yao

JOURNAL: IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET/CT) is an essential imaging instrument for lymphoma diagnosis and prognosis. PET/CT image based automatic lymphoma segmentation is increasingly used in the clinical community. U-Net-like deep learning methods have been widely used for PET/CT in this task. However, their performance is limited by the lack of sufficient annotated data, due to the existence of tumor heterogeneity. To address this issue, we propose an unsupervised image generation scheme to improve the performance of another independent supervised U-Net for lymphoma segmentation by capturing metabolic anomaly appearance (MAA). Firstly, we propose an anatomical-metabolic consistency generative adversarial network (AMC-GAN) as an auxiliary branch of U-Net. Specifically, AMC-GAN learns normal anatomical and metabolic information representations using co-aligned whole-body PET/CT scans. In the generator of AMC-GAN, we propose a complementary attention block to enhance the feature representation of low-intensity areas. Then, the trained AMC-GAN is used to reconstruct the corresponding pseudo-normal PET scans to capture MAAs. Finally, combined with the original PET/CT images, MAAs are used as the prior information for improving the performance of lymphoma segmentation. Experiments are conducted on a clinical dataset containing 191 normal subjects and 53 patients with lymphomas. The results demonstrate that the anatomical-metabolic consistency representations obtained from unlabeled paired PET/CT scans can be helpful for more accurate lymphoma segmentation, which suggest the potential of our approach to support physician diagnosis in practical clinical applications.

TITLE: Physical phantom validation of clustering-initiated factorization in dynamic PET

AUTHORS: Valerie Kobzarenko, Suzanne L Baker, Mustafa Janabi, Woon-Seng Choong, Grant T Gullberg, Youngho Seo, Rostyslav Boutchko, Debasis Mitra

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Background: Dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) enables the quantification of physiological parameters of radiotracers employed in the investigation of neuropsychiatric disorders. We previously introduced a factor analysis-based algorithm, Cluster-Initialized Factor Analysis (CIFA), designed to overcome the problem of specifying reference regions. CIFA is capable of automatically extracting distinct radiotracer binding distributions across many modalities based on the differences in tracer dynamics, and thus can distinguish regions of specific- and non-specific binding without requiring prior segmentation.

Purpose: Our goal is to quantitatively validate the ability of CIFA to resolve different dynamic biological processes by comparing the output of the algorithm to an independent benchmark. As an intermediate goal, we aim to create a physical phantom capable of modeling unique aspects of dynamic imaging and to use this phantom as the benchmark in evaluating CIFA.

Methods: CIFA was used to reconstruct18F-flortaucipir dynamic brain PET datasets acquired at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab. The resulting factor curves served as the foundation for creating dynamic input time-activity curve (TAC) combinations in a physical brain phantom specifically constructed for this purpose. The phantom represented three components: two overlapping tissue types and free radiotracer, constructed with a combination of small hydraulic elements. The physical components were scanned separately to generate a library of images, allowing us to reproduce scans of any duration with prescribed dynamics and realistic partial volume effects. The phantom was designed to produce noisy instances with compartment mixing of dynamic scans with desired activity TACs for free, non-specifically bound, and specifically bound radiotracers. Ten distinct dynamic simulations with varying levels of TAC similarity were estimated with CIFA.

Results: We directly evaluated CIFA's performance in analyzing each of the 10 dynamic datasets by computing the Pearson correlation coefficient between the estimated outputs and the ground truth tissue TACs and corresponding tissue distributions. For seven out of 10 modeled dynamics, which captured the full spectrum of realistically expected tissue TAC shapes, the curve correlation of the specific binding tissue was above 95%.

Conclusions: This work formulated an innovative process by combining a physical phantom design with PET images for evaluating the application of CIFA in the extraction of dynamic TACs from dynamic PET image data. In most cases the CIFA algorithm accurately reproduced the dynamics of the phantom simulated data.

TITLE: Continuous single-ended depth-of-interaction measurement using highly multiplexed signals and artificial neural networks

AUTHORS: Hyeong Seok Shim, Min Jeong Cho, Min Sun Lee, Jae Sung Lee

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Objective. This study aims to enhance positron emission tomography (PET) imaging systems by developing a continuous depth-of-interaction (DOI) measurement technique using a single-ended readout. Our primary focus is on reducing the number of readout channels in the scintillation detectors while maintaining accurate DOI estimations, using a high-pass filter-based signal multiplexing technique combined with artificial neural networks (ANNs).Approach. Instead of reading out all 64 signals from an 8 × 8 silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) array for DOI estimation, the proposed method technique reduces the signals into just four channels by applying high-pass filters with different time constants. To recover the original signal amplitudes, an ANN is used to demultiplex the multiplexed signals. Specifically, the ANN processes the sampled waveforms of these four multiplexed signals and estimates the energy information of the original 8 × 8 SiPM channels. In this study, two DOI estimation strategies were explored for a continuous DOI (cDOI) PET detector utilizing triangular teeth-shaped reflectors: a 'single-step estimation' method directly estimating DOI from multiplexed signals, and a 'two-stage cascade estimation' method that first demultiplexes the signals and then estimates DOI. The performances of proposed strategies were validated using data irradiated at five steps (2, 6, 10, 14, and 18 mm).Results. The signal amplitude of row/column summed signals, which were recovered using the proposed ANN-based de-multiplexing, showed strong correlation with ground truth (e.g.R2= 0.98 for 125 MHz digitizer sampling rate). Moreover, both the single-step and two-stage estimation methods achieved high accuracy in DOI estimation, with an average DOI resolution of 4.86 and 5.11 mm respectively.Significance. This novel signal multiplexing technique significantly reduces the number of required readout channels, making cDOI PET more cost-effective.

TITLE: Compartmental modeling for blood flow quantification from dynamic   15  O-water PET images of humans: a systematic review

AUTHORS: Oona Rainio, Riku Klén

JOURNAL: Annals of nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) can be used to non-invasively estimate the blood flow of different organs via compartmental modeling. Out of different PET tracers, water labeled with the radioactiveO isotope of oxygen (half-life of 2.04 min) is freely diffusable, and therefore, very well-suited for blood flow quantification. While the earlierO-water PET research has primarily focused on cerebral or myocardial blood flow quantification, the recent emergence of total-body PET scanners has enabled greater application possibilities for both PET imaging in general and alsoO-water PET based blood flow quantification in particular. However, to validate new methods, it is necessary to compare them to earlier research. To help in this process, we systematically review 53 articles quantifying blood flow via compartmental modeling. We introduce the articles organized within subcategories of cerebral, myocardial, renal, pulmonary, pancreatic, hepatic, muscle, and tumor blood flow and summarize their results so that they can easily be evaluated in terms of population characteristics of the patients such as age or sex ratio and their potential diagnoses. We compare how both the compartment model used and the potential corrections for arterial blood volume, non-perfusable tissue, spill-over from the heart cavities, and time delay caused while the tracer travels between different areas of interest are generally implemented in the articles. We also analyze the differences in the data pre-processing techniques. According to our results, the estimates of cerebral and tumor blood flow vary considerably more between the articles than those of myocardial blood flow. This might be caused by differences in the model approaches or the study populations. We also note that the choice of the unit for these estimates is quite inconsistent as certain researchers seem to prefer mL/min/g over mL/min/mL even if no weight or density parameter is present in the modeling. We encourage more research on sex- and age-based differences in blood flow estimates and organ-specific blood flow quantification studies for kidneys, lungs, liver, and other important organs besides brain and heart.

TITLE: A simulation study of 1D U-Net-based inter-crystal scatter event recovery of PET detectors

AUTHORS: Jiaxuan Zou, Jianbo Ye, Jintao Yu, Ke Cui

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
To achieve high spatial resolution of reconstructed images in positron emission tomography (PET), the size of the scintillation crystal element is set small in current PET systems, which greatly increases the inter-crystal scattering (ICS) frequency. The ICS is a type of Compton scattering of the gamma photons from one crystal element to its neighborhood element, which obscures the determination of the first interaction position. In this study, we propose a 1D U-Net convolutional neural network to predict the first interaction position, which provides a universal way to efficiently solve the ICS recovery problem. The network is trained using the dataset collected from the GATE Monte Carlo simulation. The 1D U-Net structure is applied due to its capability of synthesizing both low-level and high-level information, which shows superiority in solving the ICS recovery problem. After being well trained, the 1D U-Net can generate a prediction accuracy of 78.1%. Compared to the coincidence events only composed from two photoelectric gamma photons, the sensitivity is improved by 149%. The contrast-to-noise ratio of the reconstructed contrast phantom increases from 6.973 to 10.795 for the 16 mm hot sphere. Compared to the take-energy-centroid method, the spatial resolution of the reconstructed resolution phantom can obtain the best improvement of 33.46%. Compared with the previous deep learning method based on the fully connected network, the proposed 1D U-Net can work more stably with considerably fewer network parameters. The 1D U-Net network model shows good universality when predicting different phantoms, and the computation speed is fast.

TITLE: BPGAN: Brain PET synthesis from MRI using generative adversarial network for multi-modal Alzheimer's disease diagnosis

AUTHORS: Jin Zhang, Xiaohai He, Linbo Qing, Feng Gao, Bin Wang

JOURNAL: Computer methods and programs in biomedicine

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Background and objective: Multi-modal medical images, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET), have been widely used for the diagnosis of brain disorder diseases like Alzheimer's disease (AD) since they can provide various information. PET scans can detect cellular changes in organs and tissues earlier than MRI. Unlike MRI, PET data is difficult to acquire due to cost, radiation, or other limitations. Moreover, PET data is missing for many subjects in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. To solve this problem, a 3D end-to-end generative adversarial network (named BPGAN) is proposed to synthesize brain PET from MRI scans, which can be used as a potential data completion scheme for multi-modal medical image research.

Methods: We propose BPGAN, which learns an end-to-end mapping function to transform the input MRI scans to their underlying PET scans. First, we design a 3D multiple convolution U-Net (MCU) generator architecture to improve the visual quality of synthetic results while preserving the diverse brain structures of different subjects. By further employing a 3D gradient profile (GP) loss and structural similarity index measure (SSIM) loss, the synthetic PET scans have higher-similarity to the ground truth. In this study, we explore alternative data partitioning ways to study their impact on the performance of the proposed method in different medical scenarios.

Results: We conduct experiments on a publicly available ADNI database. The proposed BPGAN is evaluated by mean absolute error (MAE), peak-signal-to-noise-ratio (PSNR) and SSIM, superior to other compared models in these quantitative evaluation metrics. Qualitative evaluations also validate the effectiveness of our approach. Additionally, combined with MRI and our synthetic PET scans, the accuracies of multi-class AD diagnosis on dataset-A and dataset-B are 85.00% and 56.47%, which have been improved by about 1% and 1%, respectively, compared to the stand-alone MRI.

Conclusions: The experimental results of quantitative measures, qualitative displays, and classification evaluation demonstrate that the synthetic PET images by BPGAN are reasonable and high-quality, which provide complementary information to improve the performance of AD diagnosis. This work provides a valuable reference for multi-modal medical image analysis.

TITLE: A review of different methods used for quantification and assessment of FDG-PET/CT in multiple myeloma

AUTHORS: Mahdi Zirakchian Zadeh, Cyrus Ayubcha, William Y Raynor, Thomas J Werner, Abass Alavi

JOURNAL: Nuclear medicine communications

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
The quantification of positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) in multiple myeloma (MM) is challenging. Different methods of PET/CT quantification for assessment of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in myeloma patients have been suggested. This is the first review article that focuses on the advantages and disadvantages of each approach. Use of the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) showed some promise in prognostic stratification of MM patients. However, it is affected by noise and time of flight and is subject to high variability. Volumetric PET metrics such as total lesion glycolysis and metabolic tumor volume are other proposed approaches. The high number of osteolytic lesions in MM patients makes this approach difficult in clinical practice. In addition, evaluation of small focal lesions is subject to partial volume correction. CT-based segmentation for assessment of FDG radiotracer is recently introduced. The methodologies are highly reproducible, but the clinical values of the approaches are unclear and still under investigation. We also discuss the Italian Myeloma criteria for PET Use (IMPeTUs), which is a qualitative approach, as a point of comparison. The reproducibility of IMPeTUs depends heavily on the level of user experience. We recommend further studies for assessing the prognostic significance of CT-threshold approaches in the assessment of MM patients.

JOURNAL: Physica medica : PM : an international journal devoted to the applications of physics to medicine and biology : official journal of the Italian Association of Biomedical Physics (AIFB)

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
The aim of this study was to design an image restoration algorithm that combined denoising and deblurring and to confirm its applicability in positron emission tomography (PET) images of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). PET images of patients with AD obtained using18F-AV-45, which have a lot of noise, and18F-FDG, which have a lot of blurring, were available in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative open dataset. The proposed framework performed image restoration incorporating blind deconvolution after noise reduction using a non-local means (NLM) approach to improve the PET image quality. We found that the coefficient of variation result after denoising and deblurring of the18F-AV-45 image was improved 1.34 times compared to that for the degraded image. In addition, the profile result of the18F-FDG PET image of patients with AD, which had a relatively large amount of blurring, showed a gentle shape when deblurring was performed after denoising. The overall no-reference-based evaluation results showed different results according to the degree of noise and blurring in the PET images. In conclusion, the applicability of the deconvolution deblurring algorithm to AD PET images after NLM denoising processing was demonstrated in this study.

TITLE: PETformer network enables ultra-low-dose total-body PET imaging without structural prior

AUTHORS: Yuxiang Li, Yusheng Li

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Objective.Positron emission tomography (PET) is essential for non-invasive imaging of metabolic processes in healthcare applications. However, the use of radiolabeled tracers exposes patients to ionizing radiation, raising concerns about carcinogenic potential, and warranting efforts to minimize doses without sacrificing diagnostic quality.Approach.In this work, we present a novel neural network architecture, PETformer, designed for denoising ultra-low-dose PET images without requiring structural priors such as computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging. The architecture utilizes a U-net backbone, synergistically combining multi-headed transposed attention blocks with kernel-basis attention and channel attention mechanisms for both short- and long-range dependencies and enhanced feature extraction. PETformer is trained and validated on a dataset of 317 patients imaged on a total-body uEXPLORER PET/CT scanner.Main results.Quantitative evaluations using structural similarity index measure and liver signal-to-noise ratio showed PETformer's significant superiority over other established denoising algorithms across different dose-reduction factors.Significance.Its ability to identify and recover intrinsic anatomical details from background noise with dose reductions as low as 2% and its capacity in maintaining high target-to-background ratios while preserving the integrity of uptake values of small lesions enables PET-only fast and accurate disease diagnosis. Furthermore, PETformer exhibits computational efficiency with only 37 M trainable parameters, making it well-suited for commercial integration.

TITLE: Enhancement and evaluation for deep learning-based classification of volumetric neuroimaging with 3D-to-2D knowledge distillation

AUTHORS: Hyemin Yoon, Do-Young Kang, Sangjin Kim

JOURNAL: Scientific reports

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
The application of deep learning techniques for the analysis of neuroimaging has been increasing recently. The 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) technology, which is commonly adopted to encode volumetric information, requires a large number of datasets. However, due to the nature of the medical domain, there are limitations in the number of data available. This is because the cost of acquiring imaging is expensive and the use of personnel to annotate diagnostic labels is resource-intensive. For these reasons, several prior studies have opted to use comparatively lighter 2D CNNs instead of the complex 3D CNN technology. They analyze using projected 2D datasets created from representative slices extracted from 3D volumetric imaging. However, this approach, by selecting only projected 2D slices from the entire volume, reflects only partial volumetric information. This poses a risk of developing lesion diagnosis systems without a deep understanding of the interrelations among volumetric data. We propose a novel 3D-to-2D knowledge distillation framework that utilizes not only the projected 2D dataset but also the original 3D volumetric imaging dataset. This framework is designed to employ volumetric prior knowledge in training 2D CNNs. Our proposed method includes three modules: (i) a 3D teacher network that encodes volumetric prior knowledge from the 3D dataset, (ii) a 2D student network that encodes partial volumetric information from the 2D dataset, and aims to develop an understanding of the original volumetric imaging, and (iii) a distillation loss introduced to reduce the gap in the graph representation expressing the relationship between data in the feature embedding spaces of (i) and (ii), thereby enhancing the final performance. The effectiveness of our proposed method is demonstrated by improving the classification performance orthogonally across various 2D projection methods on two datasets from the 123I-DaTscan SPECT and 18 F-AV133 PET from Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI). Notably, when our approach is applied to the FuseMe approach, it achieves an F1 score of 98.30%, which is higher than that of the 3D teacher network (97.66%).

TITLE: ECPC-IDS: A benchmark endometrial cancer PET/CT image dataset for evaluation of semantic segmentation and detection of hypermetabolic regions

AUTHORS: Dechao Tang, Chen Li, Tianmin Du, Huiyan Jiang, Deguo Ma, Zhiyu Ma, Marcin Grzegorzek, Tao Jiang, Hongzan Sun

JOURNAL: Computers in biology and medicine

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Background: Endometrial cancer is one of the most common tumors in the female reproductive system and is the third most common gynecological malignancy that causes death after ovarian and cervical cancer. Early diagnosis can significantly improve the 5-year survival rate of patients. With the development of artificial intelligence, computer-assisted diagnosis plays an increasingly important role in improving the accuracy and objectivity of diagnosis and reducing the workload of doctors. However, the absence of publicly available image datasets restricts the application of computer-assisted diagnostic techniques.

Methods: In this paper, a publicly available Endometrial Cancer PET/CT Image Dataset for Evaluation of Semantic Segmentation and Detection of Hypermetabolic Regions (ECPC-IDS) are published. Specifically, the segmentation section includes PET and CT images, with 7159 images in multiple formats totally. In order to prove the effectiveness of segmentation on ECPC-IDS, six deep learning semantic segmentation methods are selected to test the image segmentation task. The object detection section also includes PET and CT images, with 3579 images and XML files with annotation information totally. Eight deep learning methods are selected for experiments on the detection task.

Results: This study is conduct using deep learning-based semantic segmentation and object detection methods to demonstrate the distinguishability on ECPC-IDS. From a separate perspective, the minimum and maximum values of Dice on PET images are 0.546 and 0.743, respectively. The minimum and maximum values of Dice on CT images are 0.012 and 0.510, respectively. The target detection section's maximum mAP values on PET and CT images are 0.993 and 0.986, respectively.

Conclusion: As far as we know, this is the first publicly available dataset of endometrial cancer with a large number of multi-modality images. ECPC-IDS can assist researchers in exploring new algorithms to enhance computer-assisted diagnosis, benefiting both clinical doctors and patients. ECPC-IDS is also freely published for non-commercial at: https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/ECPC-IDS/23808258.

JOURNAL: Nuclear medicine communications

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Introduction: This computational study evaluates the accuracy of kinetic models and acquisition schemes in dynamic PET imaging using simulations of 18 F-fallypride PET in the human brain on the real-world data.

Methods: We employed a 2-tissue 4-k model to generate ideal tissue curves for three regions (putamen, thalamus, and temporal cortex) and a reference region (cerebellum), incorporating a simulated metabolite-corrected input function. Realistic measurements were simulated over a 240-min PET scan by defining acquisition protocols (frame timings and durations), modeling tracer decay, and adding noise. Distribution volume ratios (DVRs) were calculated using the Logan reference analysis and the simplified reference tissue model (SRTM), the relative error in DVR was also assessed across various acquisition protocols. Rate constants from the 2-tissue model were varied, and Bland-Altman analysis was quantified to determine bias relative to ground-truth DVR.

Results: Results indicate that, under low noise conditions, the Logan reference method performed optimally with a protocol involving a 60-min dynamic scan, a 60-min break, a 30-min scan, another 60-min break, and a final 30-min scan. In noisier conditions, the SRTM yielded the best results with a 150-min effective scan time incorporating three breaks.

Conclusion: These findings highlight the impact of noise and acquisition strategy on model performance, informing optimal PET imaging protocols.

TITLE: Effect of different examination conditions on image quality and quantitative value of amyloid positron emission tomography using 18F-flutemetamol

AUTHORS: Tamaki Otani, Hideki Otsuka, Kou Matsushita, Yoichi Otomi, Yamato Kunikane, Shota Azane, Masafumi Amano, Masafumi Harada, Hirokazu Miyoshi

JOURNAL: Annals of nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Objective: The recommended start time for18F-flutemetamol amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) examination is 60-120 min after18F-flutemetamol injection, while an acquisition time of 10-30 min is generally recommended. We aimed to elucidate the effects of different examination conditions on image quality, diagnostic ability, and quantitative value of amyloid PET using18F-flutemetamol.

Methods: We acquired data on a Discovery PET/computed tomography 710 scanner using Hoffman brain and pillar phantoms with 20 MBq of18F for 30 min. The images were reconstructed into 10-, 20-, and 30-min periods. The ordered subset-expectation maximization algorithm was used for image reconstruction, which uses a 2- or 4-mm Gaussian filter and a combination of iteration and subset numbers. The percentage contrast and coefficient of variation (CV; as the image noise) were used as physical evaluation indices for reconstructed images, and images with superior contrast and low image noise were selected for clinical evaluation. The imaging data of 15 symptomatic patients (n = 7 and n = 8 for positive and negative diagnoses of Alzheimer's disease, respectively) were reconstructed under the phantom study conditions. Radiographers visually evaluated and ranked the clinical images based on the overall contrast and image noise, and nuclear medicine specialists diagnosed Alzheimer's disease. We compared the standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) obtained with different acquisition conditions.

Results: The basic study using the phantom revealed high convergence of contrast and image noise in five patterns of acquisition time and filter strengths. Regarding visual evaluation, the use of a 2-mm Gaussian filter caused difficulties in diagnosis because the brain parenchymal accumulation was mottled with high image noise. Differences in image quality and diagnostic ability due to different examination times were not significant. Differences in the SUVR were not significant in patients with a negative Alzheimer's disease diagnosis; in patients with a positive diagnosis, the SUVR showed significant fluctuation depending on the acquisition conditions.

Conclusion: The differences in image quality and diagnostic performance due to the differences in 10-min acquisition time were not significant; however, of note, SUVR showed significant fluctuation depending on the acquisition conditions in patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease.

AUTHORS: Yansong Zhu, Siqi Li, Zhaoheng Xie, Edwin K Leung, Reimund Bayerlein, Negar Omidvari, Yasser G Abdelhafez, Simon R Cherry, Jinyi Qi, Ramsey D Badawi, Benjamin A Spencer, Guobao Wang

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Dual-energy (DE) CT enables material decomposition by using two different x-ray energies and may be combined with PET for improved multimodality imaging. However, this increases radiation dose and may require a hardware upgrade due to the added second x-ray CT scan. The recently proposed PET-enabled DECT method allows dual-energy imaging using a conventional PET/CT scanner without the need to change scanner hardware or increase radiation exposure. Here we demonstrate the first-time physical phantom and patient data evaluation of this method.

Methods: The PET-enabled DECT method reconstructs a gamma-ray CT (gCT) image at 511 keV from the time-of-flight PET data with the maximum-likelihood attenuation and activity (MLAA) approach and then combines this image with the low-energy x-ray CT images to form a dual-energy image pair for material decomposition. To improve the image quality of gCT, a kernel MLAA method was developed using the x-ray CT as a priori information. Here we developed a general open-source implementation for gCT reconstruction and used this implementation for the first real data validation using both physical phantom study and human-subject study. Results from PET-enabled DECT were compared using x-ray DECT as the reference. Further, we applied the PET-enabled DECT method in another patient study to evaluate bone lesions.

Results: Compared to the standard MLAA, results from the kernel MLAA showed significantly improved image quality. PET-enabled DECT with the kernel MLAA was able to generate fractional images that were comparable to the x-ray DECT, with high correlation coefficients for both the phantom study and human subject study (R > 0.99). The application study also indicates that PET-enabled DECT has potential to characterize bone lesions.

Conclusion: Results from this study have demonstrated the feasibility of this PET-enabled method for CT imaging and material decomposition. PET-enabled DECT shows promise to provide comparable results to x-ray DECT.

TITLE: Partial volume correction of PET image data using geometric transfer matrices based on uniform B-splines

AUTHORS: Joseph B Mandeville, Nikos Efthimiou, Jonah Weigand-Whittier, Erin Hardy, Gitte M Knudsen, Louise M Jørgensen, Yin-Ching I Chen

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Objective. Most methods for partial volume correction (PVC) of positron emission tomography (PET) data employ anatomical segmentation of images into regions of interest. This approach is not optimal for exploratory functional imaging beyond regional hypotheses. Here, we describe a novel method for unbiased voxel-wise PVC.Approach.B-spline basis functions were combined with geometric transfer matrices to enable a method (bsGTM) that provides PVC or alternatively provides smoothing with minimal regional crosstalk. The efficacy of the proposed method was evaluated using Monte Carlo simulations, human PET data, and murine functional PET data.Main results.In simulations, bsGTM provided recovery of partial volume signal loss comparable to iterative deconvolution, while demonstrating superior resilience to noise. In a real murine PET dataset, bsGTM yielded much higher sensitivity for detecting amphetamine-induced reduction of [11C]raclopride binding potential. In human PET data, bsGTM smoothing enabled increased signal-to-noise ratios with less degradation of binding potentials relative to Gaussian convolution or non-local means.Significance.bsGTM offers improved performance for PVC relative to iterative deconvolution, the current method of choice for voxel-wise PVC, especially in the common PET regime of low signal-to-noise ratio. The new method provides an anatomically unbiased way to compensate partial volume errors in cases where anatomical segmentation is unavailable or of questionable relevance or accuracy.

TITLE: Deep learning-based combination of [18F]-FDG PET and CT images for producing pulmonary perfusion image

AUTHORS: Jiabing Gu, Qingtao Qiu, Jian Zhu, Qiang Cao, Zhen Hou, Baosheng Li, Huazhong Shu

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Background: The main application of [18F] FDG-PET (18FDG-PET) and CT images in oncology is tumor identification and quantification. Combining PET and CT images to mine pulmonary perfusion information for functional lung avoidance radiation therapy (FLART) is desirable but remains challenging.

Purpose: To develop a deep-learning-based (DL) method to combine18FDG-PET and CT images for producing pulmonary perfusion images (PPI).

Methods: Pulmonary technetium-99 m-labeled macroaggregated albumin SPECT (PPISPECT),18FDG-PET, and CT images obtained from 53 patients were enrolled. CT and PPISPECTimages were rigidly registered, and registration displacement was subsequently used to align18FDG-PET and PPISPECTimages. The left/right lung was separated and rigidly registered again to improve the registration accuracy. A DL model based on 3D Unet architecture was constructed to directly combine multi-modality18FDG-PET and CT images for producing PPI (PPIDLM). 3D Unet architecture was used as the basic architecture, and the input was expanded from a single-channel to a dual-channel to combine multi-modality images. For comparative evaluation,18FDG-PET images were also used alone to generate PPIDLPET. Sixty-seven samples were randomly selected for training and cross-validation, and 36 were used for testing. The Spearman correlation coefficient (rs) and multi-scale structural similarity index measure (MS-SSIM) between PPIDLM/PPIDLPETand PPISPECTwere computed to assess the statistical and perceptual image similarities. The Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) was calculated to determine the similarity between high-/low- functional lung (HFL/LFL) volumes.

Results: The voxel-wise rsand MS-SSIM of PPIDLM/PPIDLPETwere 0.78 ± 0.04/0.57 ± 0.03, 0.93 ± 0.01/0.89 ± 0.01 for cross-validation and 0.78 ± 0.11/0.55 ± 0.18, 0.93 ± 0.03/0.90 ± 0.04 for testing. PPIDLM/PPIDLPETachieved averaged DSC values of 0.78 ± 0.03/0.64 ± 0.02 for HFL and 0.83 ± 0.01/0.72 ± 0.03 for LFL in the training dataset and 0.77 ± 0.11/0.64 ± 0.12, 0.82 ± 0.05/0.72 ± 0.06 in the testing dataset. PPIDLMyielded a stronger correlation and higher MS-SSIM with PPISPECTthan PPIDLPET(p < 0.001).

Conclusions: The DL-based method integrates lung metabolic and anatomy information for producing PPI and significantly improved the accuracy over methods based on metabolic information alone. The generated PPIDLMcan be applied for pulmonary perfusion volume segmentation, which is potentially beneficial for FLART treatment plan optimization.

TITLE: Virtual high-count PET image generation using a deep learning method

AUTHORS: Juan Liu, Sijin Ren, Rui Wang, Niloufarsadat Mirian, Yu-Jung Tsai, Michal Kulon, Darko Pucar, Ming-Kai Chen, Chi Liu

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Recently, deep learning-based methods have been established to denoise the low-count positron emission tomography (PET) images and predict their standard-count image counterparts, which could achieve reduction of injected dosage and scan time, and improve image quality for equivalent lesion detectability and clinical diagnosis. In clinical settings, the majority scans are still acquired using standard injection dose with standard scan time. In this work, we applied a 3D U-Net network to reduce the noise of standard-count PET images to obtain the virtual-high-count (VHC) PET images for identifying the potential benefits of the obtained VHC PET images.

Methods: The training datasets, including down-sampled standard-count PET images as the network input and high-count images as the desired network output, were derived from 27 whole-body PET datasets, which were acquired using 90-min dynamic scan. The down-sampled standard-count PET images were rebinned with matched noise level of 195 clinical static PET datasets, by matching the normalized standard derivation (NSTD) inside 3D liver region of interests (ROIs). Cross-validation was performed on 27 PET datasets. Normalized mean square error (NMSE), peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index (SSIM), and standard uptake value (SUV) bias of lesions were used for evaluation on standard-count and VHC PET images, with real-high-count PET image of 90 min as the gold standard. In addition, the network trained with 27 dynamic PET datasets was applied to 195 clinical static datasets to obtain VHC PET images. The NSTD and mean/max SUV of hypermetabolic lesions in standard-count and VHC PET images were evaluated. Three experienced nuclear medicine physicians evaluated the overall image quality of randomly selected 50 out of 195 patients' standard-count and VHC images and conducted 5-score ranking. A Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare differences in the grading of standard-count and VHC images.

Results: The cross-validation results showed that VHC PET images had improved quantitative metrics scores than the standard-count PET images. The mean/max SUVs of 35 lesions in the standard-count and true-high-count PET images did not show significantly statistical difference. Similarly, the mean/max SUVs of VHC and true-high-count PET images did not show significantly statistical difference. For the 195 clinical data, the VHC PET images had a significantly lower NSTD than the standard-count images. The mean/max SUVs of 215 hypermetabolic lesions in the VHC and standard-count images showed no statistically significant difference. In the image quality evaluation by three experienced nuclear medicine physicians, standard-count images and VHC images received scores with mean and standard deviation of 3.34±0.80 and 4.26 ± 0.72 from Physician 1, 3.02 ± 0.87 and 3.96 ± 0.73 from Physician 2, and 3.74 ± 1.10 and 4.58 ± 0.57 from Physician 3, respectively. The VHC images were consistently ranked higher than the standard-count images. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test also indicated that the image quality evaluation between standard-count and VHC images had significant difference.

Conclusions: A DL method was proposed to convert the standard-count images to the VHC images. The VHC images had reduced noise level. No significant difference in mean/max SUV to the standard-count images was observed. VHC images improved image quality for better lesion detectability and clinical diagnosis.

TITLE: Brain PET motion correction using 3D face-shape model: the first clinical study

AUTHORS: Yuma Iwao, Go Akamatsu, Hideaki Tashima, Miwako Takahashi, Taiga Yamaya

JOURNAL: Annals of nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Objective: Head motions during brain PET scan cause degradation of brain images, but head fixation or external-maker attachment become burdensome on patients. Therefore, we have developed a motion correction method that uses a 3D face-shape model generated by a range-sensing camera (Kinect) and by CT images. We have successfully corrected the PET images of a moving mannequin-head phantom containing radioactivity. Here, we conducted a volunteer study to verify the effectiveness of our method for clinical data.

Methods: Eight healthy men volunteers aged 22-45 years underwent a 10-min head-fixed PET scan as a standard of truth in this study, which was started 45 min after18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (285 ± 23 MBq) injection, and followed by a 15-min head-moving PET scan with the developed Kinect based motion-tracking system. First, selecting a motion-less period of the head-moving PET scan provided a reference PET image. Second, CT images separately obtained on the same day were registered to the reference PET image, and create a 3D face-shape model, then, to which Kinect-based 3D face-shape model matched. This matching parameter was used for spatial calibration between the Kinect and the PET system. This calibration parameter and the motion-tracking of the 3D face shape by Kinect comprised our motion correction method. The head-moving PET with motion correction was compared with the head-fixed PET images visually and by standard uptake value ratios (SUVRs) in the seven volume-of-interest regions. To confirm the spatial calibration accuracy, a test-retest experiment was performed by repeating the head-moving PET with motion correction twice where the volunteer's pose and the sensor's position were different.

Results: No difference was identified visually and statistically in SUVRs between the head-moving PET images with motion correction and the head-fixed PET images. One of the small nuclei, the inferior colliculus, was identified in the head-fixed PET images and in the head-moving PET images with motion correction, but not in those without motion correction. In the test-retest experiment, the SUVRs were well correlated (determinant coefficient, r2= 0.995).

Conclusion: Our motion correction method provided good accuracy for the volunteer data which suggested it is useable in clinical settings.

TITLE: M3S-Net: multi-modality multi-branch multi-self-attention network with structure-promoting loss for low-dose PET/CT enhancement

AUTHORS: Dong Wang, Chong Jiang, Jian He, Yue Teng, Hourong Qin, Jijun Liu, Xiaoping Yang

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Objective.PET (Positron Emission Tomography) inherently involves radiotracer injections and long scanning time, which raises concerns about the risk of radiation exposure and patient comfort. Reductions in radiotracer dosage and acquisition time can lower the potential risk and improve patient comfort, respectively, but both will also reduce photon counts and hence degrade the image quality. Therefore, it is of interest to improve the quality of low-dose PET images.Approach.A supervised multi-modality deep learning model, named M3S-Net, was proposed to generate standard-dose PET images (60 s per bed position) from low-dose ones (10 s per bed position) and the corresponding CT images. Specifically, we designed a multi-branch convolutional neural network with multi-self-attention mechanisms, which first extracted features from PET and CT images in two separate branches and then fused the features to generate the final generated PET images. Moreover, a novel multi-modality structure-promoting term was proposed in the loss function to learn the anatomical information contained in CT images.Main results.We conducted extensive numerical experiments on real clinical data collected from local hospitals. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, the proposed M3S-Net not only achieved higher objective metrics and better generated tumors, but also performed better in preserving edges and suppressing noise and artifacts.Significance.The experimental results of quantitative metrics and qualitative displays demonstrate that the proposed M3S-Net can generate high-quality PET images from low-dose ones, which are competable to standard-dose PET images. This is valuable in reducing PET acquisition time and has potential applications in dynamic PET imaging.

TITLE: HD-RDS-UNet: Leveraging Spatial-Temporal Correlation Between the Decoder Feature Maps for Lymphoma Segmentation

AUTHORS: Meng Wang, Huiyan Jiang, Tianyu Shi, Yu-Dong Yao

JOURNAL: IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Lymphoma is cancer originated in the lymphatic system. Clinically, automatic and accurate lymphoma segmentation is critical yet challenging. Recently, UNet-like architectures are widely used for medical image segmentation. The pure UNet-like architectures can model the spatial correlation between the feature maps very well, whereas they discard the critical temporal correlation. Some prior works combine UNet with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to utilize the spatial and temporal correlation simultaneously. However, it is inconvenient to incorporate some advanced techniques proposed for UNet to RNNs, which hampers their further improvements. In this paper, we propose a recurrent dense siamese decoder architecture, which simulates RNNs and can densely utilize the spatial temporal correlation between the decoder feature maps following a "UNet" approach. We combine it with a modified hyper dense encoder. Therefore, the proposed model is a UNet with a hyper dense encoder and a recurrent dense siamese decoder (HD-RDS-UNet). To stabilize the training process, we propose a weighted Dice loss with stable gradient and self-adaptive parameters. We perform patient-independent five-fold cross-validation on 3D volumes collected from whole-body PET/CT scans of patients with lymphomas. The experimental results show that the volume-wise average Dice score and sensitivity are 85.58% and 94.63%, respectively. The patient-wise average Dice score and sensitivity are 85.85% and 95.01%, respectively. The different configurations of HD-RDS-UNet consistently show superiority in the performance comparison. Besides, a trained HD-RDS-UNet can be easily pruned, resulting in significantly reduced inference time and memory usage, while keeping very good segmentation performance.

TITLE: Strategies for deep learning-based attenuation and scatter correction of brain 18 F-FDG PET images in the image domain

AUTHORS: Reza Jahangir, Alireza Kamali-Asl, Hossein Arabi, Habib Zaidi

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Background: Attenuation and scatter correction is crucial for quantitative positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. Direct attenuation correction (AC) in the image domain using deep learning approaches has been recently proposed for combined PET/MR and standalone PET modalities lacking transmission scanning devices or anatomical imaging.

Purpose: In this study, different input settings were considered in the model training to investigate deep learning-based AC in the image space.

Methods: Three different deep learning methods were developed for direct AC in the image space: (i) use of non-attenuation-corrected PET images as input (NonAC-PET), (ii) use of attenuation-corrected PET images with a simple two-class AC map (composed of soft-tissue and background air) obtained from NonAC-PET images (PET segmentation-based AC [SegAC-PET]), and (iii) use of both NonAC-PET and SegAC-PET images in a Double-Channel fashion to predict ground truth attenuation corrected PET images with Computed Tomography images (CTAC-PET). Since a simple two-class AC map (generated from NonAC-PET images) can easily be generated, this work assessed the added value of incorporating SegAC-PET images into direct AC in the image space. A 4-fold cross-validation scheme was adopted to train and evaluate the different models based using 80 brain18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT images. The voxel-wise and region-wise accuracy of the models were examined via measuring the standardized uptake value (SUV) quantification bias in different regions of the brain.

Results: The overall root mean square error (RMSE) for the Double-Channel setting was 0.157 ± 0.08 SUV in the whole brain region, while RMSEs of 0.214 ± 0.07 and 0.189 ± 0.14 SUV were observed in NonAC-PET and SegAC-PET models, respectively. A mean SUV bias of 0.01 ± 0.26% was achieved by the Double-Channel model regarding the activity concentration in cerebellum region, as opposed to 0.08 ± 0.28% and 0.05 ± 0.28% SUV biases for the network that uniquely used NonAC-PET or SegAC-PET as input, respectively. SegAC-PET images with an SUV bias of -1.15 ± 0.54%, served as a benchmark for clinically accepted errors. In general, the Double-Channel network, relying on both SegAC-PET and NonAC-PET images, outperformed the other AC models.

Conclusion: Since the generation of two-class AC maps from non-AC PET images is straightforward, the current study investigated the potential added value of incorporating SegAC-PET images into a deep learning-based direct AC approach. Altogether, compared with models that use only NonAC-PET and SegAC-PET images, the Double-Channel deep learning network exhibited superior attenuation correction accuracy.

TITLE: Change in positron emission tomography perfusion imaging quality with a data-driven motion correction algorithm

AUTHORS: Yushui Han, Ahmed Ibrahim Ahmed, Charles Hayden, Aaron K Jung, Jean Michel Saad, Bruce Spottiswoode, Faisal Nabi, Mouaz H Al-Mallah

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear cardiology : official publication of the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Introduction: Cardiac motion frequently reduces the interpretability of PET images. This study utilized a prototype data-driven motion correction (DDMC) algorithm to generate corrected images and compare DDMC images with non-corrected images (NMC) to evaluate image quality and change of perfusion defect size and severity.

Methods: Rest and stress images with NMC and DDMC from 40 consecutive patients with motion were rated by 2 blinded investigators on a 4-point visual ordinal scale (0: minimal motion; 1: mild motion; 2: moderate motion; 3: severe motion/uninterpretable). Motion was also quantified using Dwell Fraction, which is the fraction of time the motion vector shows the heart to be within 6 mm of the corrected position and was derived from listmode data of NMC images.

Results: Minimal motion was seen in 15% of patients, while 40%, 30%, and 15% of patients had mild moderate and severe motion, respectively. All corrected images showed an improvement in quality and were interpretable after processing. This was confirmed by a significant correlation (Spearman's correlation coefficient 0.626, P < .001) between machine measurement of motion quantification and physician interpretation.

Conclusion: The novel DDMC algorithm improved quality of cardiac PET images with motion. Correlation between machine measurement of motion quantification and physician interpretation was significant.

TITLE: Multimodal feature-guided diffusion model for low-count PET image denoising

AUTHORS: Gengjia Lin, Yuxi Jin, Zhenxing Huang, Zixiang Chen, Haizhou Liu, Chao Zhou, Xu Zhang, Wei Fan, Na Zhang, Dong Liang, Peng Cao, Zhanli Hu

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Background: To minimize radiation exposure while obtaining high-quality Positron Emission Tomography (PET) images, various methods have been developed to derive standard-count PET (SPET) images from low-count PET (LPET) images. Although deep learning methods have enhanced LPET images, they rarely utilize the rich complementary information from MR images. Even when MR images are used, these methods typically employ early, intermediate, or late fusion strategies to merge features from different CNN streams, failing to fully exploit the complementary properties of multimodal fusion.

Purpose: In this study, we introduce a novel multimodal feature-guided diffusion model, termed MFG-Diff, designed for the denoising of LPET images with the full utilization of MRI.

Methods: MFG-Diff replaces random Gaussian noise with LPET images and introduces a novel degradation operator to simulate the physical degradation processes of PET imaging. Besides, it uses a novel cross-modal guided restoration network to fully exploit the modality-specific features provided by the LPET and MR images and utilizes a multimodal feature fusion module employing cross-attention mechanisms and positional encoding at multiple feature levels for better feature fusion.

Results: Under four counts (2.5%, 5.0%, 10%, and 25%), the images generated by our proposed network showed superior performance compared to those produced by other networks in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, as well as in statistical analysis. In particular, the peak-signal-to-noise ratio of the generated PET images improved by more than 20% under a 2.5% count, the structural similarity index improved by more than 16%, and the root mean square error reduced by nearly 50%. On the other hand, our generated PET images had significant correlation (Pearson correlation coefficient, 0.9924), consistency, and excellent quantitative evaluation results with the SPET images.

Conclusions: The proposed method outperformed existing state-of-the-art LPET denoising models and can be used to generate highly correlated and consistent SPET images obtained from LPET images.

AUTHORS: Xiang Zhou, Song Xue, Lianghua Li, Robert Seifert, Shunjie Dong, Ruohua Chen, Gang Huang, Axel Rominger, Jianjun Liu, Kuangyu Shi

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: While sedation is routinely used in pediatric PET examinations to preserve diagnostic quality, it may result in side effects and may affect the radiotracer's biodistribution. This study aims to investigate the feasibility of sedation-free pediatric PET imaging using ultra-fast total-body (TB) PET scanners and deep learning (DL)-based attenuation and scatter correction (ASC).

Methods: This retrospective study included TB PET (uExplorer) imaging of 35 sedated pediatric patients under four years old to determine the minimum effective scanning time. A DL-based ASC method was applied to enhance PET quantification. Both quantitative and qualitative assessments were conducted to evaluate the image quality of ultra-fast DL-ASC PET. Five non-sedated pediatric patients were subsequently used to validate the proposed approach.

Results: Comparisons between standard 300-second and ultra-fast 15-second imaging, CT-ASC and DL-ASC ultra-fast 15-second images, as well as DL-ASC ultra-fast 15-second images in non-sedated and sedated patients, showed no significant differences in qualitative scoring, lesion detectability, and quantitative Standard Uptake Value (SUV) (P = ns).

Conclusions: This study demonstrates that pediatric PET imaging can be effectively performed without sedation by combining ultra-fast imaging techniques with a DL-based ASC. This advancement in sedation-free ultra-fast PET imaging holds potential for broader clinical adoption.

TITLE: Structure-guided MR-to-CT synthesis with spatial and semantic alignments for attenuation correction of whole-body PET/MR imaging

AUTHORS: Jiaxu Zheng, Zhenrong Shen, Lichi Zhang, Qun Chen

JOURNAL: Medical image analysis

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Image synthesis from Magnetic Resonance (MR) to Computed Tomography (CT) can estimate the electron density of tissues, thereby facilitating Positron Emission Tomography (PET) attenuation correction in whole-body PET/MR imaging. Whole-body MR-to-CT synthesis faces several challenges including the spatial misalignment caused by tissue variety and respiratory movements, and the complex intensity mapping due to large intensity variations across the whole body. However, existing MR-to-CT synthesis methods mainly focus on body sub-regions, making them ineffective in addressing these challenges. Here we propose a novel whole-body MR-to-CT synthesis framework, which consists of three novel modules to tackle these challenges: (1) Structure-Guided Synthesis module leverages structure-guided attention gates to enhance synthetic image quality by diminishing unnecessary contours of soft tissues; (2) Spatial Alignment module yields precise registration between paired MR and CT images by taking into account the impacts of tissue volumes and respiratory movements, thus providing well-aligned ground-truth CT images during training; (3) Semantic Alignment module utilizes contrastive learning to constrain organ-related semantic information, thereby ensuring the semantic authenticity of synthetic CT images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method produces visually plausible and semantically accurate CT images, outperforming existing approaches in both synthetic image quality and PET attenuation correction accuracy.

TITLE: Effect of Bayesian penalty likelihood algorithm on 18F-FDG PET/CT image of lymphoma

AUTHORS: Yongtao Wang, Lejun Lin, Wei Quan, Jinyu Li, Weilong Li

JOURNAL: Nuclear medicine communications

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Objective: Recently, a new Bayesian penalty likelihood (BPL) reconstruction algorithm has been applied in PET, which is expected to provide better image resolution than the widely used ordered subset expectation maximization (OSEM). The purpose of this study is to compare the differences between these two algorithms in terms of image quality and effects on clinical diagnostics and quantification of lymphoma.

Methods: A total of 246 FDG-positive lesions in 70 patients with lymphoma were retrospectively analyzed by using BPL and OSEM + time-of-flight + point spread function algorithms. Visual analysis was used to evaluate the effects of different reconstruction algorithms on clinical image quality and diagnostic certainty. Quantitative analysis was used to compare the differences between pathology and lesion size.

Results: There were significant differences in lesion-related SUVmax, total-lesion-glycolysis (TLG), and signal-to-background ratio (SBR) (P < 0.01). The variation Δ SUVmax% and Δ SBR% caused by the two reconstruction algorithms were negatively correlated with tumor diameter, while Δ MTV% and Δ TLG% were positively correlated with tumor diameter. In the grouped analysis based on pathology, there were significant differences in lesion SUVmax, lesion SUVmean, and SBR. In non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (diffuse large B cells and follicular lymphoma), diversities were significantly found in SUVmax, SUVmean, SBR, and TLG of the lesions (P < 0.05). According to the grouped analysis based on lesion size, for lesions smaller than 1 cm and 2 cm, there was a significant difference in SUVmean, SUVmax, SBR, and MTV, but not in lesions larger than or equal to 2 cm (P > 0.05), and the liver background SUVmean (P > 0.05) remained unchanged.

Conclusion: BPL reconstruction algorithm could effectively improve clinical image quality and diagnostic certainty. In quantitative analysis, there were no significant differences among different pathological groups, but there were significant diversities in lesion sizes. Especially for small lesions, lesion SUVmax increased and SBR was significantly improved, which may better assist in the diagnosis of small lesions of lymphoma.

TITLE: Minimizing the need for coil attenuation correction in integrated PET/MRI at 1.5 T using low-density MR-linac receive arrays

AUTHORS: Stefan E Zijlema, Woutjan Branderhorst, Remco Bastiaannet, Rob H N Tijssen, Jan J W Lagendijk, Cornelis A T van den Berg

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
The simultaneous use of positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) requires attenuation correction (AC) of photon-attenuating objects, such as MRI receive arrays. However, AC of flexible, on-body arrays is complex and therefore often omitted. This can lead to significant, spatially varying PET signal losses when conventional MRI receive arrays are used. Only few dedicated, photon transparent PET/MRI arrays exist, none of which are compatible with our new, wide-bore 1.5 T PET/MRI system dedicated to radiotherapy planning. In this work, we investigated the use of 1.5 T MR-linac (MRL) receive arrays for PET/MRI, as these were designed to have a low photon attenuation for accurate dose delivery and can be connected to the new 1.5 T PET/MRI scanner. Three arrays were assessed: an 8-channel clinically-used MRL array, a 32-channel prototype MRL array, and a conventional MRI receive array. We experimentally determined, simulated, and compared the impact of these arrays on the PET sensitivity and image reconstructions. Furthermore, MRI performance was compared. Overall coil-induced PET sensitivity losses were reduced from 8.5% (conventional) to 1.7% (clinical MRL) and 0.7% (prototype MRL). Phantom measurements showed local signal errors of up to 32.7% (conventional) versus 3.6% (clinical MRL) and 3.5% (prototype MRL). Simulations with data of eight cancer patients showed average signal losses were reduced from 14.3% (conventional) to 1.2% (clinical MRL) and 1.0% (prototype MRL). MRI data showed that the signal-to-noise ratio of the MRL arrays was slightly lower at depth (110 versus 135). The parallel imaging performance of the conventional and prototype MRL arrays was similar, while the clinical MRL array's performance was lower. In conclusion, MRL arrays reducein-vivoPET signal losses >10×, which decreases, or eliminates, the need for coil AC on a new 1.5 T PET/MRI system. The prototype MRL array allows flexible coil positioning without compromising PET or MRI performance. One limitation of MRL arrays is their limited radiolucent PET window (field of view) in the craniocaudal direction.

ABSTRACT:
This work set out to develop a motion-correction approach aided by conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) methodology that allows reliable, data-driven determination of involuntary subject motion during dynamic18F-FDG brain studies.Methods:Ten healthy volunteers (5 men/5 women; mean age ± SD, 27 ± 7 y; weight, 70 ± 10 kg) underwent a test-retest18F-FDG PET/MRI examination of the brain (n= 20). The imaging protocol consisted of a 60-min PET list-mode acquisition contemporaneously acquired with MRI, including MR navigators and a 3-dimensional time-of-flight MR angiography sequence. Arterial blood samples were collected as a reference standard representing the arterial input function (AIF). Training of the cGAN was performed using 70% of the total datasets (n= 16, randomly chosen), which was corrected for motion using MR navigators. The resulting cGAN mappings (between individual frames and the reference frame [55-60 min after injection]) were then applied to the test dataset (remaining 30%,n= 6), producing artificially generated low-noise images from early high-noise PET frames. These low-noise images were then coregistered to the reference frame, yielding 3-dimensional motion vectors. Performance of cGAN-aided motion correction was assessed by comparing the image-derived input function (IDIF) extracted from a cGAN-aided motion-corrected dynamic sequence with the AIF based on the areas under the curves (AUCs). Moreover, clinical relevance was assessed through direct comparison of the average cerebral metabolic rates of glucose (CMRGlc) values in gray matter calculated using the AIF and the IDIF.Results:The absolute percentage difference between AUCs derived using the motion-corrected IDIF and the AIF was (1.2% + 0.9%). The gray matter CMRGlc values determined using these 2 input functions differed by less than 5% (2.4% + 1.7%).Conclusion:A fully automated data-driven motion-compensation approach was established and tested for18F-FDG PET brain imaging. cGAN-aided motion correction enables the translation of noninvasive clinical absolute quantification from PET/MR to PET/CT by allowing the accurate determination of motion vectors from the PET data itself.

TITLE: ISA-Net: Improved spatial attention network for PET-CT tumor segmentation

ABSTRACT:
Background and objective: Achieving accurate and automated tumor segmentation plays an important role in both clinical practice and radiomics research. Segmentation in medicine is now often performed manually by experts, which is a laborious, expensive and error-prone task. Manual annotation relies heavily on the experience and knowledge of these experts. In addition, there is much intra- and interobserver variation. Therefore, it is of great significance to develop a method that can automatically segment tumor target regions.

Methods: In this paper, we propose a deep learning segmentation method based on multimodal positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT), which combines the high sensitivity of PET and the precise anatomical information of CT. We design an improved spatial attention network(ISA-Net) to increase the accuracy of PET or CT in detecting tumors, which uses multi-scale convolution operation to extract feature information and can highlight the tumor region location information and suppress the non-tumor region location information. In addition, our network uses dual-channel inputs in the coding stage and fuses them in the decoding stage, which can take advantage of the differences and complementarities between PET and CT.

Results: We validated the proposed ISA-Net method on two clinical datasets, a soft tissue sarcoma(STS) and a head and neck tumor(HECKTOR) dataset, and compared with other attention methods for tumor segmentation. The DSC score of 0.8378 on STS dataset and 0.8076 on HECKTOR dataset show that ISA-Net method achieves better segmentation performance and has better generalization.

Conclusions: The method proposed in this paper is based on multi-modal medical image tumor segmentation, which can effectively utilize the difference and complementarity of different modes. The method can also be applied to other multi-modal data or single-modal data by proper adjustment.

TITLE: Field-programable-gate-array-based distributed coincidence processor for high count-rate online positron emission tomography coincidence data acquisition

AUTHORS: Xinyi Cheng, Kun Hu, Dongxu Yang, Yiping Shao

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
For positron emission tomography (PET) online data acquisition, a centralized coincidence processor (CCP) with single-thread data processing has been used to select coincidence events for many PET scanners. A CCP has the advantages of highly integrated circuit, compact connection between detector front-end and system electronics and centralized control of data process and decision making. However, it also has the drawbacks of data process delay, difficulty in handling very high count-rates of single and coincidence events and complicated algorithms to implement. These problems are exacerbated when implementing a CCP on a field-programable-gate-array (FPGA) due to increased routing congestion and reduced data throughput. Industry companies have applied non-centralized or distributed data processing to solve these problems, but those solutions remain either proprietary or lack full disclosure of technical details that make the techniques unclear and difficult to adapt for most research communities. In this study, we investigated the use of a set of distributed coincidence processors (DCP) that can address the CCP problems and be implemented relatively easily. Each coincidence processor exclusively connects one detector pair and selects coincidence events from this detector pair only, which breaks a centralized coincidence process to a collection of independent and parallel processes. DCP can significantly minimize the data process delay, maximize count-rates of coincidence events and simplify implementation by implementing a single coincidence processor with one detector pair and replicating it to the rest. A prototype DCP with 42 coincidence processors was implemented on an off-the-shelf FPGA development board for a small PET with 12 detectors configured with 42 detector pairs. DCP performances were tested with both pulsed signals and gamma ray interactions. There was no coincidence data loss up to the detector's maximum singles count-rate (250 k s-1). Approximately 1.2 k registers were utilized for each coincidence processor and the FPGA resource utilization was proportional to the number of coincidence processors. Coincidence timing spectra showed the results from accurately acquired coincidence events. In conclusion: complementary to CCP, DCP can provide high count-rate capability, with a simplified algorithm for implementation and potentially a practical solution for online acquisition of a PET with a larger number of detector pairs or for ultrahigh-throughput imaging.

TITLE: Enhancing efficient deep learning models with multimodal, multi-teacher insights for medical image segmentation

AUTHORS: Khondker Fariha Hossain, Sharif Amit Kamran, Joshua Ong, Alireza Tavakkoli

JOURNAL: Scientific reports

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
The rapid evolution of deep learning has dramatically enhanced the field of medical image segmentation, leading to the development of models with unprecedented accuracy in analyzing complex medical images. Deep learning-based segmentation holds significant promise for advancing clinical care and enhancing the precision of medical interventions. However, these models' high computational demand and complexity present significant barriers to their application in resource-constrained clinical settings. To address this challenge, we introduce Teach-Former, a novel knowledge distillation (KD) framework that leverages a Transformer backbone to effectively condense the knowledge of multiple teacher models into a single, streamlined student model. Moreover, it excels in the contextual and spatial interpretation of relationships across multimodal images for more accurate and precise segmentation. Teach-Former stands out by harnessing multimodal inputs (CT, PET, MRI) and distilling the final predictions and the intermediate attention maps, ensuring a richer spatial and contextual knowledge transfer. Through this technique, the student model inherits the capacity for fine segmentation while operating with a significantly reduced parameter set and computational footprint. Additionally, introducing a novel training strategy optimizes knowledge transfer, ensuring the student model captures the intricate mapping of features essential for high-fidelity segmentation. The efficacy of Teach-Former has been effectively tested on two extensive multimodal datasets, HECKTOR21 and PI-CAI22, encompassing various image types. The results demonstrate that our KD strategy reduces the model complexity and surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods to achieve superior performance. The findings of this study indicate that the proposed methodology could facilitate efficient segmentation of complex multimodal medical images, supporting clinicians in achieving more precise diagnoses and comprehensive monitoring of pathological conditions ( https://github.com/FarihaHossain/TeachFormer ).

TITLE: PETcoil: first results from a second-generation RF-penetrable TOF-PET brain insert for simultaneous PET/MRI

AUTHORS: Qian Dong, Muhammad Nasir Ullah, Derek Innes, Ronald D Watkins, Chen-Ming Chang, Sarah J Zou, Andrew Groll, Ilaria Sacco, Garry Chinn, Craig S Levin

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Simultaneous positron emission tomography (PET)/magnetic resonance imaging provides concurrent information about anatomic, functional, and molecular changes in disease. We are developing a second generation MR-compatible RF-penetrable TOF-PET insert. The insert has a smaller scintillation crystal size and ring diameter compared to clinical whole-body PET scanners, resulting in higher spatial resolution and sensitivity. This paper reports the initial system performance of this full-ring PET insert. The global photopeak energy resolution and global coincidence time resolution, 11.74 ± 0.03 % FWHM and 238.1 ± 0.5 ps FWHM, respectively, are preserved as we scaled up the system to a full ring comprising 12, 288 LYSO-SiPM channels (crystal size: 3.2 × 3.2 × 20 mm3). Throughout a ten-hour experiment, the system performance remained stable, exhibiting a less than 1% change in all measured parameters. In a resolution phantom study, the system successfully resolved all 2.8 mm diameter rods, achieving an average VPR of 0.28 ± 0.08 without TOF and 0.24 ± 0.07 with TOF applied. Moreover, the implementation of TOF in the Hoffman phantom study also enhanced image quality. Initial MR compatibility studies of the full PET ring were performed with it unpowered as a milestone to focus on looking for material and geometry-related artifacts. During all MR studies, the MR body coil functioned as both the transmit and receive coil, and no observable artifacts were detected. As expected, using the body coil also as the RF receiver, MR image signal-to-noise ratio exhibited degradation (∼30%), so we are developing a high quality receive-only coil that resides inside the PET ring.

TITLE: Evaluation of three methods for delineation and attenuation estimation of the sinus region in MR-based attenuation correction for brain PET-MR imaging

AUTHORS: Jani Lindén, Jarmo Teuho, Mika Teräs, Riku Klén

JOURNAL: BMC medical imaging

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Background: Attenuation correction is crucial in quantitative positron emission tomography-magnetic resonance (PET-MRI) imaging. We evaluated three methods to improve the segmentation and modelling of the attenuation coefficients in the nasal sinus region. Two methods (cuboid and template method) included a MRI-CT conversion model for assigning the attenuation coefficients in the nasal sinus region, whereas one used fixed attenuation coefficient assignment (bulk method).

Methods: The study population consisted of data of 10 subjects which had undergone PET-CT and PET-MRI. PET images were reconstructed with and without time-of-flight (TOF) using CT-based attenuation correction (CTAC) as reference. Comparison was done visually, using DICE coefficients, correlation, analyzing attenuation coefficients, and quantitative analysis of PET and bias atlas images.

Results: The median DICE coefficients were 0.824, 0.853, 0.849 for the bulk, cuboid and template method, respectively. The median attenuation coefficients were 0.0841 cm-1, 0.0876 cm-1, 0.0861 cm-1and 0.0852 cm-1, for CTAC, bulk, cuboid and template method, respectively. The cuboid and template methods showed error of less than 2.5% in attenuation coefficients. An increased correlation to CTAC was shown with the cuboid and template methods. In the regional analysis, improvement in at least 49% and 80% of VOI was seen with non-TOF and TOF imaging. All methods showed errors less than 2.5% in non-TOF and less than 2% in TOF reconstructions.

Conclusions: We evaluated two proof-of-concept methods for improving quantitative accuracy in PET/MRI imaging and showed that bias can be further reduced by inclusion of TOF. Largest improvements were seen in the regions of olfactory bulb, Heschl's gyri, lingual gyrus and cerebellar vermis. However, the overall effect of inclusion of the sinus region as separate class in MRAC to PET quantification in the brain was considered modest.

TITLE: A multi-modality physical phantom for mimicking tumor heterogeneity patterns in PET/CT and PET/MRI

AUTHORS: Alejandra Valladares, Thomas Beyer, Laszlo Papp, Elisabeth Salomon, Ivo Rausch

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Background: Hybrid imaging (e.g., positron emission tomography [PET]/computed tomography [CT], PET/magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) helps one to visualize and quantify morphological and physiological tumor characteristics in a single study. The noninvasive characterization of tumor heterogeneity is essential for grading, treatment planning, and following-up oncological patients. However, conventional (CONV) image-based parameters, such as tumor diameter, tumor volume, and radiotracer activity uptake, are insufficient to describe tumor heterogeneities. Here, radiomics shows promise for a better characterization of tumors. Nevertheless, the validation of such methods demands imaging objects capable of reflecting heterogeneities in multi-modality imaging. We propose a phantom to simulate tumor heterogeneity repeatably in PET, CT, and MRI.

Methods: The phantom consists of three 50-ml plastic tubes filled partially with acrylic spheres of S1: 1.6 mm, S2: 50%(1.6 mm)/50%(6.3 mm), or S3: 6.3-mm diameter. The spheres were fixed to the bottom of each tube by a plastic grid, yielding one sphere free homogeneous region and one heterogeneous (S1, S2, or S3) region per tube. A 3-tube phantom and its replica were filled with a fluorodeoxyglucose (18F) solution for test-retest measurements in a PET/CT Siemens TPTV and a PET/MR Siemens Biograph mMR system. A number of 42 radiomic features (10 first order and 32 texture features) were calculated for each phantom region and imaging modality. Radiomic features stability was evaluated through coefficients of variation (COV) across phantoms and scans for PET, CT, and MRI. Further, the Wilcoxon test was used to assess the capability of stable features to discriminate the simulated phantom regions.

Results: The different patterns (S1-S3) did present visible heterogeneity in all imaging modalities. However, only for CT and MRI, a clear visual difference was present between the different patterns. Across all phantom regions in PET, CT, and MR images, 10, 16, and 21 features out of 42 evaluated features in total had a COV of 10% or less. In particular, CONV, histogram, and gray-level run length matrix features showed high repeatability for all the phantom regions and imaging modalities. Several of repeatable texture features allowed the image-based discrimination of the different phantom regions (p < 0.05). However, depending on the feature, different pattern discrimination capabilities were found for the different imaging modalities.

Conclusion: The proposed phantom appears suitable for simulating heterogeneities in PET, CT, and MRI. We demonstrate that it is possible to select radiomic features for the readout of the phantom. Most of these features had been shown to be relevant in previous clinical studies.

TITLE: Robust-Deep: A Method for Increasing Brain Imaging Datasets to Improve Deep Learning Models' Performance and Robustness

AUTHORS: Amirhossein Sanaat, Isaac Shiri, Sohrab Ferdowsi, Hossein Arabi, Habib Zaidi

JOURNAL: Journal of digital imaging

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
A small dataset commonly affects generalization, robustness, and overall performance of deep neural networks (DNNs) in medical imaging research. Since gathering large clinical databases is always difficult, we proposed an analytical method for producing a large realistic/diverse dataset. Clinical brain PET/CT/MR images including full-dose (FD), low-dose (LD) corresponding to only 5 % of events acquired in the FD scan, non-attenuated correction (NAC) and CT-based measured attenuation correction (MAC) PET images, CT images and T1 and T2 MR sequences of 35 patients were included. All images were registered to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template. Laplacian blending was used to make a natural presentation using information in the frequency domain of images from two separate patients, as well as the blending mask. This classical technique from the computer vision and image processing communities is still widely used and unlike modern DNNs, does not require the availability of training data. A modified ResNet DNN was implemented to evaluate four image-to-image translation tasks, including LD to FD, LD+MR to FD, NAC to MAC, and MRI to CT, with and without using the synthesized images. Quantitative analysis using established metrics, including the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index metric (SSIM), and joint histogram analysis was performed for quantitative evaluation. The quantitative comparison between the registered small dataset containing 35 patients and the large dataset containing 350 synthesized plus 35 real dataset demonstrated improvement of the RMSE and SSIM by 29% and 8% for LD to FD, 40% and 7% for LD+MRI to FD, 16% and 8% for NAC to MAC, and 24% and 11% for MRI to CT mapping task, respectively. The qualitative/quantitative analysis demonstrated that the proposed model improved the performance of all four DNN models through producing images of higher quality and lower quantitative bias and variance compared to reference images.

TITLE: [Breast cancer lesion segmentation based on co-learning feature fusion and Transformer]

ABSTRACT:
The PET/CT imaging technology combining positron emission tomography (PET) and computed tomography (CT) is the most advanced imaging examination method currently, and is mainly used for tumor screening, differential diagnosis of benign and malignant tumors, staging and grading. This paper proposes a method for breast cancer lesion segmentation based on PET/CT bimodal images, and designs a dual-path U-Net framework, which mainly includes three modules: encoder module, feature fusion module and decoder module. Among them, the encoder module uses traditional convolution for feature extraction of single mode image; The feature fusion module adopts collaborative learning feature fusion technology and uses Transformer to extract the global features of the fusion image; The decoder module mainly uses multi-layer perceptron to achieve lesion segmentation. This experiment uses actual clinical PET/CT data to evaluate the effectiveness of the algorithm. The experimental results show that the accuracy, recall and accuracy of breast cancer lesion segmentation are 95.67%, 97.58% and 96.16%, respectively, which are better than the baseline algorithm. Therefore, it proves the rationality of the single and bimodal feature extraction method combining convolution and Transformer in the experimental design of this article, and provides reference for feature extraction methods for tasks such as multimodal medical image segmentation or classification.

TITLE: Assessment of image-derived input functions from small vessels for patlak parametric imaging using total-body PET/CT

AUTHORS: Hongmei Tang, Yang Wu, Zhaoting Cheng, Shuang Song, Qingjian Dong, Yu Zhou, Zhiping Shu, Zhanli Hu, Xiaohua Zhu

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: The image-derived input function (IDIF) from the descending aorta has demonstrated performance comparable to arterial blood sampling while avoiding its invasive nature in parametric imaging. However, in conventional PET, large vessels may not always be within the imaging field of view (FOV). This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of dynamic parametric Ki imaging using image-derived input functions (IDIFs) extracted from various arteries, facilitated by total-body PET/CT.

Method: Twenty-three participants underwent a 60-minute total-body [18F]FDG PET scan. Data from each subject were used to reconstruct both total-body PET images and short-axis field-of-view PET images at different bed positions, each with a 25 cm axial field-of-view (AFOV). Partial volume correction (PVC) was performed using the blurred Van Cittert iterative deconvolution. IDIFs extracted from the descending aorta, carotid artery, abdominal aorta, and iliac artery were employed for Patlak analysis. The resulting Ki images were compared using quantification indicators and subjective assessment. Linear regression analysis was conducted to examine the correlation of Ki values among IDIFs in normal organ and lesion regions of interest (ROIs).

Result: High similarities were observed in Ki images derived from the IDIFs from the descending aorta and other arteries, with a median structural similarity index measure (SSIM) above 0.98 and a median peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) above 37dB. Linear regression analysis revealed strong correlations in Ki values (r² > 0.88) between the descending aorta and the three alternative vessels, with slopes of the linear fits close to 1. No significant difference in lesion detectability among IDIFs was found, as assessed visually and using metrics such as tumor-to-background ratio (TBR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) (P < 0.05).

Conclusion: IDIFs from smaller vessels can reliably reconstruct parametric Ki images without compromising lesion detectability, providing clinically relevant information.

TITLE: Three-dimensional self-attention conditional GAN with spectral normalization for multimodal neuroimaging synthesis

AUTHORS: Haoyu Lan, Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, Arthur W Toga, Farshid Sepehrband

JOURNAL: Magnetic resonance in medicine

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: To develop a new 3D generative adversarial network that is designed and optimized for the application of multimodal 3D neuroimaging synthesis.

Methods: We present a 3D conditional generative adversarial network (GAN) that uses spectral normalization and feature matching to stabilize the training process and ensure optimization convergence (called SC-GAN). A self-attention module was also added to model the relationships between widely separated image voxels. The performance of the network was evaluated on the data set from ADNI-3, in which the proposed network was used to predict PET images, fractional anisotropy, and mean diffusivity maps from multimodal MRI. Then, SC-GAN was applied on a multidimensional diffusion MRI experiment for superresolution application. Experiment results were evaluated by normalized RMS error, peak SNR, and structural similarity.

Results: In general, SC-GAN outperformed other state-of-the-art GAN networks including 3D conditional GAN in all three tasks across all evaluation metrics. Prediction error of the SC-GAN was 18%, 24% and 29% lower compared to 2D conditional GAN for fractional anisotropy, PET and mean diffusivity tasks, respectively. The ablation experiment showed that the major contributors to the improved performance of SC-GAN are the adversarial learning and the self-attention module, followed by the spectral normalization module. In the superresolution multidimensional diffusion experiment, SC-GAN provided superior predication in comparison to 3D Unet and 3D conditional GAN.

Conclusion: In this work, an efficient end-to-end framework for multimodal 3D medical image synthesis (SC-GAN) is presented. The source code is also made available at https://github.com/Haoyulance/SC-GAN.

TITLE: CycleSGAN: A cycle-consistent and semantics-preserving generative adversarial network for unpaired MR-to-CT image synthesis

AUTHORS: Runze Wang, Alexander F Heimann, Moritz Tannast, Guoyan Zheng

JOURNAL: Computerized medical imaging and graphics : the official journal of the Computerized Medical Imaging Society

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
CycleGAN has been leveraged to synthesize a CT image from an available MR image after trained on unpaired data. Due to the lack of direct constraints between the synthetic and the input images, CycleGAN cannot guarantee structural consistency and often generates inaccurate mappings that shift the anatomy, which is highly undesirable for downstream clinical applications such as MRI-guided radiotherapy treatment planning and PET/MRI attenuation correction. In this paper, we propose a cycle-consistent and semantics-preserving generative adversarial network, referred as CycleSGAN, for unpaired MR-to-CT image synthesis. Our design features a novel and generic way to incorporate semantic information into CycleGAN. This is done by designing a pair of three-player games within the CycleGAN framework where each three-player game consists of one generator and two discriminators to formulate two distinct types of adversarial learning: appearance adversarial learning and structure adversarial learning. These two types of adversarial learning are alternately trained to ensure both realistic image synthesis and semantic structure preservation. Results on unpaired hip MR-to-CT image synthesis show that our method produces better synthetic CT images in both accuracy and visual quality as compared to other state-of-the-art (SOTA) unpaired MR-to-CT image synthesis methods.

TITLE: Diffusion-driven multi-modality medical image fusion

AUTHORS: Jiantao Qu, Dongjin Huang, Yongsheng Shi, Jinhua Liu, Wen Tang

JOURNAL: Medical & biological engineering & computing

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Multi-modality medical image fusion (MMIF) technology utilizes the complementarity of different modalities to provide more comprehensive diagnostic insights for clinical practice. Existing deep learning-based methods often focus on extracting the primary information from individual modalities while ignoring the correlation of information distribution across different modalities, which leads to insufficient fusion of image details and color information. To address this problem, a diffusion-driven MMIF method is proposed to leverage the information distribution relationship among multi-modality images in the latent space. To better preserve the complementary information from different modalities, a local and global network (LAGN) is suggested. Additionally, a loss strategy is designed to establish robust constraints among diffusion-generated images, original images, and fused images. This strategy supervises the training process and prevents information loss in fused images. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses state-of-the-art image fusion methods in terms of unsupervised metrics on three datasets: MRI/CT, MRI/PET, and MRI/SPECT images. The proposed method successfully captures rich details and color information. Furthermore, 16 doctors and medical students were invited to evaluate the effectiveness of our method in assisting clinical diagnosis and treatment.

AUTHORS: Zhenxing Huang, Yaping Wu, Fangfang Fu, Nan Meng, Fengyun Gu, Qi Wu, Yun Zhou, Yongfeng Yang, Xin Liu, Hairong Zheng, Dong Liang, Meiyun Wang, Zhanli Hu

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Total-body dynamic positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) provides much sensitivity for clinical imaging and research, bringing new opportunities and challenges regarding the generation of total-body parametric images. This study investigated parametric [Formula: see text] images directly generated from static PET images without an image-derived input function on a 2-m total-body PET/CT scanner (uEXPLORER) using a deep learning model to significantly reduce the dynamic scanning time and improve patient comfort.

Methods: [Formula: see text]F-Fluorodeoxyglucose ([Formula: see text]F-FDG) 2-m total-body PET/CT image pairs were acquired for 200 patients (scanned once) with two protocols: one parametric PET image (60 min, 0[Formula: see text]60 min) and one static PET image (10 min, range of 50[Formula: see text]60 min). A deep learning model was implemented to predict parametric [Formula: see text] images from the static PET images. Evaluation metrics, including the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index measure (SSIM), and normalized mean square error (NMSE), were calculated for a 10-fold cross-validation assessment. Moreover, image quality was assessed by two nuclear medicine physicians in terms of clinical readings.

Results: The synthetic parametric PET images were qualitatively and quantitatively consistent with the reference images. In particular, the global mean SSIM between the synthetic and reference parametric [Formula: see text] images exceeded 0.9 across all test patients. On the other hand, the overall subjective quality of the synthetic parametric PET images was 4.00 ± 0.45 (the highest possible rating is 5) according to the two expert nuclear medicine physicians.

Conclusion: The findings illustrated the feasibility of the proposed technique and its potential to reduce the required scanning duration for 2-m total-body dynamic PET/CT systems. Moreover, this study explored the potential of direct parametric image generation with uEXPLORER. Deep learning technologies may output high-quality synthetic parametric images, and the validation of clinical applications and the interpretability of network models still need further research in future works.

TITLE: Functional imaging using radiomic features in assessment of lymphoma

AUTHORS: Marius E Mayerhoefer, Lale Umutlu, Heiko Schöder

JOURNAL: Methods (San Diego, Calif.)

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Lymphomas are typically large, well-defined, and relatively homogeneous tumors, and therefore represent ideal targets for the use of radiomics. Of the available functional imaging tests, [18F]FDG-PET for body lymphoma and diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) for central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma are of particular interest. The current literature suggests that two main applications for radiomics in lymphoma show promise: differentiation of lymphomas from other tumors, and lymphoma treatment response and outcome prognostication. In particular, encouraging results reported in the limited number of presently available studies that utilize functional imaging suggest that (1) MRI-based radiomics enables differentiation of CNS lymphoma from glioblastoma, and (2) baseline [18F]FDG-PET radiomics could be useful for survival prognostication, adding to or even replacing commonly used metrics such as standardized uptake values and metabolic tumor volume. However, due to differences in biological and clinical characteristics of different lymphoma subtypes and an increasing number of treatment options, more data are required to support these findings. Furthermore, a consensus on several critical steps in the radiomics workflow -most importantly, image reconstruction and post processing, lesion segmentation, and choice of classification algorithm- is desirable to ensure comparability of results between research institutions.

JOURNAL: PloS one

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Brain cancers caused by malignant brain tumors are one of the most fatal cancer types with a low survival rate mostly due to the difficulties in early detection. Medical professionals therefore use various invasive and non-invasive methods for detecting and treating brain tumors at the earlier stages thus enabling early treatment. The main non-invasive methods for brain tumor diagnosis and assessment are brain imaging like computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. In this paper, the focus is on detection and segmentation of brain tumors from 2D and 3D brain MRIs. For this purpose, a complete automated system with a web application user interface is described which detects and segments brain tumors with more than 90% accuracy and Dice scores. The user can upload brain MRIs or can access brain images from hospital databases to check presence or absence of brain tumor, to check the existence of brain tumor from brain MRI features and to extract the tumor region precisely from the brain MRI using deep neural networks like CNN, U-Net and U-Net++. The web application also provides an option for entering feedbacks on the results of the detection and segmentation to allow healthcare professionals to add more precise information on the results that can be used to train the model for better future predictions and segmentations.

TITLE: Observer-study-based approaches to quantitatively evaluate the realism of synthetic medical images

ABSTRACT:
Objective.Synthetic images generated by simulation studies have a well-recognized role in developing and evaluating imaging systems and methods. However, for clinically relevant development and evaluation, the synthetic images must be clinically realistic and, ideally, have the same distribution as that of clinical images. Thus, mechanisms that can quantitatively evaluate this clinical realism and, ideally, the similarity in distributions of the real and synthetic images, are much needed.Approach.We investigated two observer-study-based approaches to quantitatively evaluate the clinical realism of synthetic images. In the first approach, we presented a theoretical formalism for the use of an ideal-observer study to quantitatively evaluate the similarity in distributions between the real and synthetic images. This theoretical formalism provides a direct relationship between the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, AUC, for an ideal observer and the distributions of real and synthetic images. The second approach is based on the use of expert-human-observer studies to quantitatively evaluate the realism of synthetic images. In this approach, we developed a web-based software to conduct two-alternative forced-choice (2-AFC) experiments with expert human observers. The usability of this software was evaluated by conducting a system usability scale (SUS) survey with seven expert human readers and five observer-study designers. Further, we demonstrated the application of this software to evaluate a stochastic and physics-based image-synthesis technique for oncologic positron emission tomography (PET). In this evaluation, the 2-AFC study with our software was performed by six expert human readers, who were highly experienced in reading PET scans, with years of expertise ranging from 7 to 40 years (median: 12 years, average: 20.4 years).Main results.In the ideal-observer-study-based approach, we theoretically demonstrated that the AUC for an ideal observer can be expressed, to an excellent approximation, by the Bhattacharyya distance between the distributions of the real and synthetic images. This relationship shows that a decrease in the ideal-observer AUC indicates a decrease in the distance between the two image distributions. Moreover, a lower bound of ideal-observer AUC = 0.5 implies that the distributions of synthetic and real images exactly match. For the expert-human-observer-study-based approach, our software for performing the 2-AFC experiments is available athttps://apps.mir.wustl.edu/twoafc. Results from the SUS survey demonstrate that the web application is very user friendly and accessible. As a secondary finding, evaluation of a stochastic and physics-based PET image-synthesis technique using our software showed that expert human readers had limited ability to distinguish the real images from the synthetic images.Significance.This work addresses the important need for mechanisms to quantitatively evaluate the clinical realism of synthetic images. The mathematical treatment in this paper shows that quantifying the similarity in the distribution of real and synthetic images is theoretically possible by using an ideal-observer-study-based approach. Our developed software provides a platform for designing and performing 2-AFC experiments with human observers in a highly accessible, efficient, and secure manner. Additionally, our results on the evaluation of the stochastic and physics-based image-synthesis technique motivate the application of this technique to develop and evaluate a wide array of PET imaging methods.

TITLE: Generation of synthetic CT from MRI for MRI-based attenuation correction of brain PET images using radiomics and machine learning

AUTHORS: Amin Hoseinipourasl, Gholam-Ali Hossein-Zadeh, Peyman Sheikhzadeh, Hossein Arabalibeik, Shaghayegh Karimi Alavijeh, Habib Zaidi, Mohammad Reza Ay

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Background: Accurate quantitative PET imaging in neurological studies requires proper attenuation correction. MRI-guided attenuation correction in PET/MRI remains challenging owing to the lack of direct relationship between MRI intensities and linear attenuation coefficients.

Purpose: This study aims at generating accurate patient-specific synthetic CT volumes, attenuation maps, and attenuation correction factor (ACF) sinograms with continuous values utilizing a combination of machine learning algorithms, image processing techniques, and voxel-based radiomics feature extraction approaches.

Methods: Brain MR images of ten healthy volunteers were acquired using IR-pointwise encoding time reduction with radial acquisition (IR-PETRA) and VIBE-Dixon techniques. synthetic CT (SCT) images, attenuation maps, and attenuation correction factors (ACFs) were generated using the LightGBM, a fast and accurate machine learning algorithm, from the radiomics-based and image processing-based feature maps of MR images. Additionally, ultra-low-dose CT images of the same volunteers were acquired and served as the standard of reference for evaluation. The SCT images, attenuation maps, and ACF sinograms were assessed using qualitative and quantitative evaluation metrics and compared against their corresponding reference images, attenuation maps, and ACF sinograms.

Results: The voxel-wise and volume-wise comparison between synthetic and reference CT images yielded an average mean absolute error of 60.75 ± 8.8 HUs, an average structural similarity index of 0.88 ± 0.02, and an average peak signal-to-noise ratio of 32.83 ± 2.74 dB. Additionally, we compared MRI-based attenuation maps and ACF sinograms with their CT-based counterparts, revealing average normalized mean absolute errors of 1.48% and 1.33%, respectively.

Conclusion: Quantitative assessments indicated higher correlations and similarities between LightGBM-synthesized CT and Reference CT images. Moreover, the cross-validation results showed the possibility of producing accurate SCT images, MRI-based attenuation maps, and ACF sinograms. This might spur the implementation of MRI-based attenuation correction on PET/MRI and dedicated brain PET scanners with lower computational time using CPU-based processors.

TITLE: Multi-modal segmentation with missing image data for automatic delineation of gross tumor volumes in head and neck cancers

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Background: Head and neck (HN) gross tumor volume (GTV) auto-segmentation is challenging due to the morphological complexity and low image contrast of targets. Multi-modality images, including computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography (PET), are used in the routine clinic to assist radiation oncologists for accurate GTV delineation. However, the availability of PET imaging may not always be guaranteed.

Purpose: To develop a deep learning segmentation framework for automated GTV delineation of HN cancers using a combination of PET/CT images, while addressing the challenge of missing PET data.

Methods: Two datasets were included for this study: Dataset I: 524 (training) and 359 (testing) oropharyngeal cancer patients from different institutions with their PET/CT pairs provided by the HECKTOR Challenge; Dataset II: 90 HN patients(testing) from a local institution with their planning CT, PET/CT pairs. To handle potentially missing PET images, a model training strategy named the "Blank Channel" method was implemented. To simulate the absence of a PET image, a blank array with the same dimensions as the CT image was generated to meet the dual-channel input requirement of the deep learning model. During the model training process, the model was randomly presented with either a real PET/CT pair or a blank/CT pair. This allowed the model to learn the relationship between the CT image and the corresponding GTV delineation based on available modalities. As a result, our model had the ability to handle flexible inputs during prediction, making it suitable for cases where PET images are missing. To evaluate the performance of our proposed model, we trained it using training patients from Dataset I and tested it with Dataset II. We compared our model (Model 1) with two other models which were trained for specific modality segmentations: Model 2 trained with only CT images, and Model 3 trained with real PET/CT pairs. The performance of the models was evaluated using quantitative metrics, including Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), mean surface distance (MSD), and 95% Hausdorff Distance (HD95). In addition, we evaluated our Model 1 and Model 3 using the 359 test cases in Dataset I.

Results: Our proposed model(Model 1) achieved promising results for GTV auto-segmentation using PET/CT images, with the flexibility of missing PET images. Specifically, when assessed with only CT images in Dataset II, Model 1 achieved DSC of 0.56 ± 0.16, MSD of 3.4 ± 2.1 mm, and HD95 of 13.9 ± 7.6 mm. When the PET images were included, the performance of our model was improved to DSC of 0.62 ± 0.14, MSD of 2.8 ± 1.7 mm, and HD95 of 10.5 ± 6.5 mm. These results are comparable to those achieved by Model 2 and Model 3, illustrating Model 1's effectiveness in utilizing flexible input modalities. Further analysis using the test dataset from Dataset I showed that Model 1 achieved an average DSC of 0.77, surpassing the overall average DSC of 0.72 among all participants in the HECKTOR Challenge.

Conclusions: We successfully refined a multi-modal segmentation tool for accurate GTV delineation for HN cancer. Our method addressed the issue of missing PET images by allowing flexible data input, thereby providing a practical solution for clinical settings where access to PET imaging may be limited.

TITLE: Performance and Clinical Impact of Radiomics and 3D-CNN Models for the Diagnosis of Neurodegenerative Parkinsonian Syndromes on 18 F-FDOPA PET

AUTHORS: Thi Khuyen Le, Victor Comte, Jacques Darcourt, Micheline Razzouk-Cadet, Anne-Capucine Rollet, Fanny Orlhac, Olivier Humbert

JOURNAL: Clinical nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: The aim of this study was to compare the performance and added clinical value of a semiautomated radiomics model and an automated 3-dimensinal convolutional neural network (3D-CNN) model for diagnosing neurodegenerative parkinsonian syndromes on 18 F-FDOPA PET images.

Patients and methods: This 2-center retrospective study included 687 patients with motor symptoms consistent with parkinsonian syndrome. All patients underwent 18 F-FDOPA brain PET scans, acquired on 3 PET systems from 2 different hospitals, and classified as pathological or nonpathological (by an expert nuclear physician). Artificial intelligence models were trained to replicate this medical expert's classification using 2 pipelines. The radiomics pipeline was semiautomated and involved manually segmenting the bilateral caudate and putamen nuclei; 43 radiomic features were extracted and combined using the support vector machine method. The deep learning pipeline was fully automatic and used a 3D-CNN model. Both models were trained on 417 patients and tested on an internal (n = 100) and an external (n = 170) test set. The final models' performance was evaluated using balanced accuracy and compared with that of a junior medical expert and nonexpert nuclear physician.

Results: On the internal test set, the 3D-CNN model outperformed the radiomic model with a balanced accuracy of 99% (vs 96%). It led to diagnostic performance similar to that of a junior medical expert (only 1 in 100 patients misclassified by both). On the external test set from a less experienced hospital, the 3D-CNN model allowed physicians to correctly reclassify the diagnosis of 10 out 170 patients (6%).

Conclusions: The developed 3D-CNN model can automatically diagnose neurodegenerative parkinsonian syndromes, also reducing diagnostic errors by 6% in less-experienced hospitals.

JOURNAL: NeuroImage

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
In present study we aimed to validate the use of image-derived input functions (IDIF) in the kinetic modeling of cerebral blood flow (CBF) measured by [15O]H2O PET by comparing with the accepted reference standard arterial input function (AIF). Additional comparisons were made to mean cohort AIF and CBF values acquired by methodologically independent phase-contrast mapping (PCM) MRI. Using hybrid PET/MRI an IDIF was generated by measuring the radiotracer concentration in the internal carotid arteries and correcting for partial volume effects using the intravascular volume measured from MRI-angiograms. Seven patients with carotid steno-occlusive disease and twelve healthy controls were examined at rest, after administration of acetazolamide, and, in the control group, during hyperventilation. Agreement between the techniques was examined by linear regression and Bland-Altman analysis. Global CBF values modeled using IDIF correlated with values from AIF across perfusion states in both patients (p<10-6, R2=0.82, 95% limits of agreement (LoA)=[-11.3-9.9] ml/100 g/min) and controls (p<10-6, R2=0.87, 95% LoA=[-17.1-13.7] ml/100 g/min). The reproducibility of gCBF using IDIF was identical to AIF (15.8%). Values from IDIF and AIF had equally good correlation to measurements by PCM MRI, R2=0.86 and R2=0.84, (p<10-6), respectively. Mean cohort AIF performed substantially worse than individual IDIFs (p<10-6, R2=0.63, LoA=[-12.8-25.3] ml/100 g/min). In the patient group, use of IDIF provided similar reactivity maps compared to AIF. In conclusion, global CBF values modeled using IDIF correlated with values modeled by AIF and similar perfusion deficits could be established in a patient group.

TITLE: CT-Less Whole-Body Bone Segmentation of PET Images Using a Multimodal Deep Learning Network

AUTHORS: Nan Bao, Jiaxin Zhang, Zhikun Li, Shiyu Wei, Jiazhen Zhang, Stephen E Greenwald, John A Onofrey, Yihuan Lu, Lisheng Xu

JOURNAL: IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
In bone cancer imaging, positron emission tomography (PET) is ideal for the diagnosis and staging of bone cancers due to its high sensitivity to malignant tumors. The diagnosis of bone cancer requires tumor analysis and localization, where accurate and automated wholebody bone segmentation (WBBS) is often needed. Current WBBS for PET imaging is based on paired Computed Tomography (CT) images. However, mismatches between CT and PET images often occur due to patient motion, which leads to erroneous bone segmentation and thus, to inaccurate tumor analysis. Furthermore, there are some instances where CT images are unavailable for WBBS. In this work, we propose a novel multimodal fusion network (MMF-Net) for WBBS of PET images, without the need for CT images. Specifically, the tracer activity ($\lambda$-MLAA), attenuation map ($\mu$-MLAA), and synthetic attenuation map ($\mu$-DL) images are introduced into the training data. We first design a multi-encoder structure employed to fully learn modalityspecific encoding representations of the three PET modality images through independent encoding branches. Then, we propose a multimodal fusion module in the decoder to further integrate the complementary information across the three modalities. Additionally, we introduce revised convolution units, SE (Squeeze-and-Excitation) Normalization and deep supervision to improve segmentation performance. Extensive comparisons and ablation experiments, using 130 whole-body PET image datasets, show promising results. We conclude that the proposed method can achieve WBBS with moderate to high accuracy using PET information only, which potentially can be used to overcome the current limitations of CT-based approaches, while minimizing exposure to ionizing radiation.

AUTHORS: Tao Zhou, Xinyu Ye, Huiling Lu, Yujie Guo, Hongxia Wang, Yang Liu

JOURNAL: Scientific reports

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Multi-modal medical images are important in tumor lesion detection. However, the existing detection models only use single-modal to detect lesions, a multi-modal semantic correlation is not enough to consider and lacks ability to express the shape, size, and contrast degree features of lesions. A Cross Modal YOLOv5 model (CMYOLOv5) is proposed. Firstly, there are two networks, auxiliary network is consisted by dual-branch structure to extract semantic information from PET and CT, backbone network is consisted by YOLOv5 to extract semantic information from PET/CT. Secondly, Cross-modal Features Fusion (CFF) is designed in auxiliary network to fuse PET functional information and CT anatomical information. Self-Adaptive Attention Fusion (AAF) is designed in backbone network to fuse and enhance three-modal complementary information. Thirdly, Self-Adaptive Transformer (SAT) is designed in feature enhance neck. Using Transformer with deformable attention mechanism to focus on lung tumor region. Using MLP with channel attention mechanism to enhance features representation ability of lung tumor region. Finally, Reparameter Residual Block (RRB) and Reparameter Convolution operation (RC) are designed to fully learn richer PET, CT and PET/CT feature. Comparative experiments are conducted on clinical lung tumor PET/CT multi-modality dataset, the effectiveness of CMYOLOv5 is verified by Precision, Recall, mAP, F1, FPS, and training time, experimental results are 97.16%, 96.41%, 97.18%, 96.78%, 96.37 and 3912 s. CMYOLOv5 has high precision in the detection of irregular lung tumors, which is superior to the existing advanced methods.

TITLE: Application of geometric shape-based CT field-of-view extension algorithms in an all-digital positron emission tomography/computed tomography system

AUTHORS: Tianjiao Hu, Bingxuan Li, Jigang Yang, Bo Zhang, Lei Fang, Yuqing Liu, Peng Xiao, Qingguo Xie

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Background: Computed tomography (CT)-based positron emission tomography (PET) attenuation correction (AC) is a commonly used method in PET AC. However, the CT truncation caused by the subject's limbs outside the CT field-of-view (FOV) leads to errors in PET AC.

Purpose: In order to enhance the quantitative accuracy of PET imaging in the all-digital DigitMI 930 PET/CT system, we assessed the impact of FOV truncation on its image quality and investigated the effectiveness of geometric shape-based FOV extension algorithms in this system.

Methods: We implemented two geometric shape-based FOV extension algorithms. By setting the data from different numbers of detector channels on either side of the sinogram to zero, we simulated various levels of truncation. Specific regions of interest (ROI) were selected, and the mean values of these ROIs were calculated to visually compare the differences between truncated CT, CT extended using the FOV extension algorithms, and the original CT. Furthermore, we conducted statistical analyses on the mean and standard deviation of residual maps between truncated/extended CT and the original CT at different levels of truncation. Subsequently, similar data processing was applied to PET images corrected using original CT and those corrected using simulated truncated and extended CT images. This allowed us to evaluate the influence of FOV truncation on the images produced by the DigitMI 930 PET/CT system and assess the effectiveness of the FOV extension algorithms.

Results: Truncation caused bright artifacts at the CT FOV edge and a slight increase in pixel values within the FOV. When using truncated CT data for PET AC, the PET activity outside the CT FOV decreased, while the extension algorithm effectively reduced these effects. Patient data showed that the activity within the CT FOV decreased by 60% in the truncated image compared to the base image, but this number could be reduced to at least 17.3% after extension.

Conclusion: The two geometric shape-based algorithms effectively eliminate CT truncation artifacts and restore the true distribution of CT shape and PET emission data outside the FOV in the all-digital DigitMI 930 PET/CT system. These two algorithms can be used as basic solutions for CT FOV extension in all-digital PET/CT systems.

ABSTRACT:
Objective.This study aims to address the issue of long scan durations required by traditional graphical analysis methods, such as the Logan plot and its variant, the reversible equilibrium (RE) Logan plot, for dynamic PET imaging of tracer kinetics.Approach.We propose a relative RE Logan model that builds on the principles of the Logan plot and its variant to significantly reduce scan time without compromising the accuracy of tracer kinetics analysis. The model is supported by theoretical evidence and experimental validations, including two computer simulations and one clinical data analysis.Main results.The proposed model demonstrates a significant linear relationship between the variablexand the slopeof the RE Logan plot, and the variablex' and the slopeDVT'of the relative RE Logan plot. The Pearson correlation coefficients (r) of the linear fitting of thex' to thexequal 0.9849 in the simulated data and 0.9912 in the clinical data. Similarly, thervalues for the linear fitting ofDVT'toequal 0.9989 and 0.9988 in the simulated data, and 0.9954 in the clinical data.Significance.These results demonstrate the model's capability to maintain strong linear relationships and produce parametric images comparable to the traditional RE Logan plot, but with the considerable advantage of shorter scan durations. This innovation holds significant potential for enhancing the efficiency and feasibility of PET imaging in clinical settings.

TITLE: Utilizing deep learning techniques to improve image quality and noise reduction in preclinical low-dose PET images in the sinogram domain

AUTHORS: Kishore Krishnagiri Manoj Doss, Jyh-Cheng Chen

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Background: Low-dose positron emission tomography (LD-PET) imaging is commonly employed in preclinical research to minimize radiation exposure to animal subjects. However, LD-PET images often exhibit poor quality and high noise levels due to the low signal-to-noise ratio. Deep learning (DL) techniques such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) and convolutional neural network (CNN) have the capability to enhance the quality of images derived from noisy or low-quality PET data, which encodes critical information about radioactivity distribution in the body.

Purpose: Our objective was to optimize the image quality and reduce noise in preclinical PET images by utilizing the sinogram domain as input for DL models, resulting in improved image quality as compared to LD-PET images.

Methods: A GAN and CNN model were utilized to predict high-dose (HD) preclinical PET sinograms from the corresponding LD preclinical PET sinograms. In order to generate the datasets, experiments were conducted on micro-phantoms, animal subjects (rats), and virtual simulations. The quality of DL-generated images was weighted by performing the following quantitative measures: structural similarity index measure (SSIM), root mean squared error (RMSE), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR). Additionally, DL input and output were both subjected to a spatial resolution calculation of full width half maximum (FWHM) and full width tenth maximum (FWTM). DL outcomes were then compared with the conventional denoising algorithms such as non-local means (NLM), block-matching, and 3D filtering (BM3D).

Results: The DL models effectively learned image features and produced high-quality images, as reflected in the quantitative metrics. Notably, the FWHM and FWTM values of DL PET images exhibited significantly improved accuracy compared to LD, NLM, and BM3D PET images, and just as precise as HD PET images. The MSE loss underscored the excellent performance of the models, indicating that the models performed well. To further improve the training, the generator loss (G loss) was increased to a value higher than the discriminator loss (D loss), thereby achieving convergence in the GAN model.

Conclusions: The sinograms generated by the GAN network closely resembled real HD preclinical PET sinograms and were more realistic than LD. There was a noticeable improvement in image quality and noise factor in the predicted HD images. Importantly, DL networks did not fully compromise the spatial resolution of the images.

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
The introduction of smaller footprint, more sensitive Cadmium-Zinc-Telluride (CZT)-based detectors with improved spatial and energy resolution has enabled the design of innovative full-ring 360° CZT SPECT/CT systems (e.g., VERITON®and StarGuide™). With this transformative technology now aiming to become mainstream in clinical practice, several critical questions need to be addressed. This EANM position paper provides practical recommendations on how to use these devices for routine bone SPECT/CT studies, facilitating the transition from traditional planar whole-body imaging and conventional SPECT/CT to these novel systems. In particular, initial guidance is provided on imaging acquisition and reporting workflows, image reconstruction, and CT acquisition parameters. Given the emerging nature of this technology, the available evidence base is still limited, and the proposed adaptations in workflows and scan protocols will likely evolve before being integrated into definitive guidelines. In the meantime, this EANM position paper serves as a comprehensive guide for integrating these advanced hybrid SPECT/CT imaging systems into clinical practice and outlining areas for further study.

JOURNAL: Radiological physics and technology

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Imprecise registration between positron emission tomography (PET) and anatomical magnetic resonance (MR) images is a critical source of error in MR imaging-guided partial volume correction (MR-PVC). Here, we propose a novel framework for image registration and partial volume correction, which we term PVC-optimized registration (PoR), to address imprecise registration. The PoR framework iterates PVC and registration between uncorrected PET and smoothed PV-corrected images to obtain precise registration. We applied PoR to the [11C]PiB PET data of 92 participants obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database and compared the registration results, PV-corrected standardized uptake value (SUV) and its ratio to the cerebellum (SUVR), and intra-region coefficient of variation (CoV) between PoR and conventional registration. Significant differences in registration of as much as 2.74 mm and 3.02° were observed between the two methods (effect size < - 0.8 or > 0.8), which resulted in considerable SUVR differences throughout the brain, reaching a maximal difference of 62.3% in the sensory motor cortex. Intra-region CoV was significantly reduced using the PoR throughout the brain. These results suggest that PoR reduces error as a result of imprecise registration in PVC and is a useful method for accurately quantifying the amyloid burden in PET.

TITLE: Development and evaluation of a bayesian optimization FDG population-based input function for implementing parametric imaging in the clinical practice

JOURNAL: Biomedical physics & engineering express

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Aim.Parametric imaging from dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) has gained interest for tumour diagnostics and treatment response evaluation. However, the lack of a standardized method for generating theinput function-reference curve for kinetic modelling-has led to inconsistent descriptors, contributing to uncertainties in parametric imaging reliability. This study aims to address this challenge by proposing a hyperparametric optimization method for deriving FDG population-based input function (PBIF), independent of acquisition and injection protocols.Method. This study included ten patients undergoing FDG PET scans using a standard axial field of view scanner. Image-derived input functions (IDIF) were extracted from the descending aorta, normalized, and utilized as input for PBIF modelling. Bayesian hyperparameter optimization was employed to estimate global optima for ten parameters that describe the input function through independent runs of up to 600 iterations each. The injection profile was integrated as a double rectangular profile, representing both the tracer injection and the saline flush tracer residual.Results. The Bayesian optimization successfully modelled patient-specific IDIFs (R2= 0.97). The algorithm estimated injection and flush durations in agreement with recorded values. Parameter distributions showed low variability, with median amplitude and time constant values varying by around 15%. The glucose-affine molecule dynamics were characterized by distinct time constants of 6 s, 4 min, and 70 min. Analytical and numerical comparisons of parametric imaging from IDIF and PBIF show that Patlak analysis is unaffected by the injection characteristics.Conclusion. The study highlights the benefits of Bayesian optimization for modelling PBIF without prior knowledge of injection characteristics. These findings support the existence of unified FDG PBIF, facilitating the utilization of parametric imaging across PET centres. Although the present study is based on a limited, single-centre cohort, this methodological development is intended as a foundational study to further multi-centre validation on larger population.

Purpose: This study aims to provide a detailed investigation on the noise penalization factor in Bayesian penalized likelihood (BPL)-based algorithm, with the utilization of partial volume effect correction (PVC), so as to offer the suitable beta value and optimum standardized uptake value (SUV) parameters in clinical practice for small pulmonary nodules.

Methods: A National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) image-quality phantom was scanned and images were reconstructed using BPL with beta values ranged from 100 to 1000. The recovery coefficient (RC), contrast recovery (CR), and background variability (BV) were measured to assess the quantification accuracy and image quality. In the clinical assessment, lesions were categorized into sub-centimeter (<10 mm, n = 7) group and medium size (10-30 mm, n = 16) group. Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) were measured to evaluate the image quality and lesion detectability. With PVC was performed, the impact of beta values on SUVs (SUVmax, SUVmean, SUVpeak) of small pulmonary nodules was evaluated. Subjective image analysis was performed by two experienced readers.

Results: With the increasing of beta values, RC, CR, and BV decreased gradually in the phantom work. In the clinical study, SNR and CNR of both groups increased with the beta values (P < 0.001), although the sub-centimeter group showed increases after the beta value reached over 700. In addition, highly significant negative correlations were observed between SUVs and beta values for both lesion-size groups before the PVC (P < 0.001 for all). After the PVC, SUVpeak measured from the sub-centimeter group was no significantly different among different beta values (P = 0.830).

Conclusion: Our study suggests using SUVpeak as the quantification parameter with PVC performed to mitigate the effects of beta regularization. Beta values between 300 and 400 were preferred for pulmonary nodules smaller than 30 mm.

TITLE: Noise-aware dynamic image denoising and positron range correction for Rubidium-82 cardiac PET imaging via self-supervision

ABSTRACT:
Rubidium-82 (82Rb) is a radioactive isotope widely used for cardiac PET imaging. Despite numerous benefits of82Rb, there are several factors that limits its image quality and quantitative accuracy. First, the short half-life of82Rb results in noisy dynamic frames. Low signal-to-noise ratio would result in inaccurate and biased image quantification. Noisy dynamic frames also lead to highly noisy parametric images. The noise levels also vary substantially in different dynamic frames due to radiotracer decay and short half-life. Existing denoising methods are not applicable for this task due to the lack of paired training inputs/labels and inability to generalize across varying noise levels. Second,82Rb emits high-energy positrons. Compared with other tracers such as18F,82Rb travels a longer distance before annihilation, which negatively affect image spatial resolution. Here, the goal of this study is to propose a self-supervised method for simultaneous (1) noise-aware dynamic image denoising and (2) positron range correction for82Rb cardiac PET imaging. Tested on a series of PET scans from a cohort of normal volunteers, the proposed method produced images with superior visual quality. To demonstrate the improvement in image quantification, we compared image-derived input functions (IDIFs) with arterial input functions (AIFs) from continuous arterial blood samples. The IDIF derived from the proposed method led to lower AUC differences, decreasing from 11.09% to 7.58% on average, compared to the original dynamic frames. The proposed method also improved the quantification of myocardium blood flow (MBF), as validated against15O-water scans, with mean MBF differences decreased from 0.43 to 0.09, compared to the original dynamic frames. We also conducted a generalizability experiment on 37 patient scans obtained from a different country using a different scanner. The presented method enhanced defect contrast and resulted in lower regional MBF in areas with perfusion defects. Lastly, comparison with other related methods is included to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

TITLE: CGBO-Net: Cruciform structure guided and boundary-optimized lymphoma segmentation network

AUTHORS: Xiaolin Zhu, Huiyan Jiang, Zhaoshuo Diao

JOURNAL: Computers in biology and medicine

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Lymphoma segmentation plays an important role in the diagnosis and treatment of lymphocytic tumor. Most current existing automatic segmentation methods are difficult to give precise tumor boundary and location. Semi-automatic methods are usually combined with manually added features such as bounding box or points to locate the tumor. Inspired by this, we propose a cruciform structure guided and boundary-optimized lymphoma segmentation network(CGBS-Net). The method uses a cruciform structure extracted based on PET images as an additional input to the network, while using a boundary gradient loss function to optimize the boundary of the tumor. Our method is divided into two main stages: In the first stage, we use the proposed axial context-based cruciform structure extraction (CCE) method to extract the cruciform structures of all tumor slices. In the second stage, we use PET/CT and the corresponding cruciform structure as input in the designed network (CGBO-Net) to extract tumor structure and boundary information. The Dice, Precision, Recall, IOU and RVD are 90.7%, 89.4%, 92.5%, 83.1% and 4.5%, respectively. Validate on the lymphoma dataset and publicly available head and neck data, our proposed approach is better than the other state-of-the-art semi-segmentation methods, which produces promising segmentation results.

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: This study aims to assess the added value of utilizing short-dynamic whole-body PET/CT scans and implementing motion correction before quantifying metabolic rate, offering more insights into physiological processes. While this approach may not be commonly adopted, addressing motion effects is crucial due to their demonstrated potential to cause significant errors in parametric imaging.

Methods: A 15-minute dynamic FDG PET acquisition protocol was utilized for four lymphoma patients undergoing therapy evaluation. Parametric imaging was obtained using a population-based input function (PBIF) derived from twelve patients with full 65-minute dynamic FDG PET acquisition. AI-based registration methods were employed to correct misalignments between both PET and ACCT and PET-to-PET. Tumour characteristics were assessed using both parametric images and standardized uptake values (SUV).

Results: The motion correction process significantly reduced mismatches between images without significantly altering voxel intensity values, except for SUVmax. Following the alignment of the attenuation correction map with the PET frame, an increase in SUVmaxin FDG-avid lymph nodes was observed, indicating its susceptibility to spatial misalignments. In contrast, Patlak Kiparameter was highly sensitive to misalignment across PET frames, that notably altered the Patlak slope. Upon completion of the motion correction process, the parametric representation revealed heterogeneous behaviour among lymph nodes compared to SUV images. Notably, reduced volume of elevated metabolic rate was determined in the mediastinal lymph nodes in contrast with an SUV of 5 g/ml, indicating potential perfusion or inflammation.

Conclusions: Motion resolved short-dynamic PET can enhance the utility and reliability of parametric imaging, an aspect often overlooked in commercial software.

TITLE: Deep Learning-Based Electric Field Enhancement Imaging Method for Brain Stroke

AUTHORS: Tong Zuo, Lihui Jiang, Yuhan Cheng, Xiaolong Yu, Xiaohui Tao, Yan Zhang, Rui Cao

JOURNAL: Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
In clinical settings, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or positron emission tomography (PET) are commonly employed in brain imaging to assist clinicians in determining the type of stroke in patients. However, these modalities are associated with potential hazards or limitations. In contrast, microwave imaging emerges as a promising technique, offering advantages such as non-ionizing radiation, low cost, lightweight, and portability. The primary challenges faced by microwave tomography include the severe ill-posedness of the electromagnetic inverse scattering problem and the time-consuming nature and unsatisfactory resolution of iterative quantitative algorithms. This paper proposes a learning electric field enhancement imaging method (LEFEIM) to achieve quantitative brain imaging based on a microwave tomography system. LEFEIM comprises two cascaded networks. The first, based on a convolutional neural network, utilizes the electric field from the receiving antenna to predict the electric field distribution within the imaging domain. The second network employs the electric field distribution as input to learn the dielectric constant distribution, thereby realizing quantitative brain imaging. Compared to the Born Iterative Method (BIM), LEFEIM significantly improves imaging time, while enhancing imaging quality and goodness-of-fit to a certain extent. Simultaneously, LEFEIM exhibits anti-noise capabilities.

TITLE: Qualitative and quantitative analysis of reduced bed position acquisition time on FDG PET image quality

AUTHORS: Michael Ting, Garry McDermott, Amir Zarei, Chirag Patel, Fahmid U Chowdhury, Andreia Rodrigues, Andrew F Scarsbrook

JOURNAL: Nuclear medicine communications

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
The study aim was to evaluate whether reducing bed position acquisition time would result in significant detriment to image quality. Secondary aims were to compare effect of time of flight (TOF) and Q.Clear reconstructions and patient BMI on image quality. Fluorodeoxyglucose PET-CT performed in 30 patients on a new scanner at our institution between March and May 2024 was retrospectively evaluated. Four PET reconstructions were performed: (a) 1 min 45 s TOF, (b) 2 min TOF, (c) 1 min 45 s Q.Clear, and (d) 2 min Q.Clear. For qualitative analysis, four maximum intensity projection images were evaluated side-by-side using a five-point visual score (1 = non-diagnostic, 5 = excellent). For quantitative analysis, liver signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was calculated. A statistically significant reduction in visual score occurred when reducing bed position time from 2 min to 1 min 45 s (mean TOF scores 0.24 reduction, P = 0.0002; mean Q.Clear scores 0.04 reduction, P = 0.02. There was also a statistically significant difference in liver SNR when reducing bed position time. Deterioration in image quality was minimised when bed position acquisition time was reduced if Q.Clear construction was utilized. This could facilitate increased scanning capacity without clinical detriment.

ABSTRACT:
Objective. Radiation therapy for head and neck (H&N) cancer relies on accurate segmentation of the primary tumor. A robust, accurate, and automated gross tumor volume segmentation method is warranted for H&N cancer therapeutic management. The purpose of this study is to develop a novel deep learning segmentation model for H&N cancer based on independent and combined CT and FDG-PET modalities.Approach. In this study, we developed a robust deep learning-based model leveraging information from both CT and PET. We implemented a 3D U-Net architecture with 5 levels of encoding and decoding, computing model loss through deep supervision. We used a channel dropout technique to emulate different combinations of input modalities. This technique prevents potential performance issues when only one modality is available, increasing model robustness. We implemented ensemble modeling by combining two types of convolutions with differing receptive fields, conventional and dilated, to improve capture of both fine details and global information.Main Results. Our proposed methods yielded promising results, with a Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.802 when deployed on combined CT and PET, DSC of 0.610 when deployed on CT, and DSC of 0.750 when deployed on PET.Significance. Application of a channel dropout method allowed for a single model to achieve high performance when deployed on either single modality images (CT or PET) or combined modality images (CT and PET). The presented segmentation techniques are clinically relevant to applications where images from a certain modality might not always be available.

TITLE: Residual Pix2Pix networks: streamlining PET/CT imaging process by eliminating CT energy conversion

AUTHORS: S Ghanbari, A Sadremomtaz

JOURNAL: Biomedical physics & engineering express

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Attenuation correction of PET data is commonly conducted through the utilization of a secondary imaging technique to produce attenuation maps. The customary approach to attenuation correction, which entails the employment of CT images, necessitates energy conversion. However, the present study introduces a novel deep learning-based method that obviates the requirement for CT images and energy conversion. This study employs a residual Pix2Pix network to generate attenuation-corrected PET images using the 4033 2D PET images of 37 healthy adult brains for train and test. The model, implemented in TensorFlow and Keras, was evaluated by comparing image similarity, intensity correlation, and distribution against CT-AC images using metrics such as PSNR and SSIM for image similarity, while a 2D histogram plotted pixel intensities. Differences in standardized uptake values (SUV) demonstrated the model's efficiency compared to the CTAC method. The residual Pix2Pix demonstrated strong agreement with the CT-based attenuation correction, the proposed network yielding MAE, MSE, PSNR, and MS-SSIM values of 3 × 10-3, 2 × 10-4, 38.859, and 0.99, respectively. The residual Pix2Pix model's results showed a negligible mean SUV difference of 8 × 10-4(P-value = 0.10), indicating its accuracy in PET image correction. The residual Pix2Pix model exhibits high precision with a strong correlation coefficient of R2= 0.99 to CT-based methods. The findings indicate that this approach surpasses the conventional method in terms of precision and efficacy. The proposed residual Pix2Pix framework enables accurate and feasible attenuation correction of brain F-FDG PET without CT. However, clinical trials are required to evaluate its clinical performance. The PET images reconstructed by the framework have low errors compared to the accepted test reliability of PET/CT, indicating high quantitative similarity.

TITLE: 3D quantitative myocardial perfusion imaging with hyperpolarized HP001(bis-1,1-(hydroxymethyl)-[1-13C]cyclopropane-d8): Application of gradient echo and balanced SSFP sequences

AUTHORS: Yupeng Zhao, Rie Beck Olin, Esben Søvsø Szocska Hansen, Christoffer Laustsen, Lars G Hanson, Jan Henrik Ardenkjær-Larsen

JOURNAL: Magnetic resonance in medicine

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: This study aims to show the viability of conducting three-dimensional (3D) myocardial perfusion quantification covering the entire heart using both GRE and bSSFP sequences with hyperpolarized HP001.

Methods: A GRE sequence and a bSSFP sequence, both with a stack-of-spirals readout, were designed and applied to three pigs. The images were reconstructed usingC coil sensitivity maps measured in a phantom experiment. Perfusion was quantified using a constrained decomposition method, and the estimated rest/stress perfusion values fromC GRE/bSSFP and Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) were individually analyzed through histograms and the mean perfusion values were compared with reference values obtained from PET(O-water). The Myocardial Perfusion Reserve Index (MPRI) was estimated forC GRE/bSSFP and DCE-MRI and compared with the reference values.

Results: Perfusion values, estimated by both DCE andC MRI, were found to be lower than reference values. However, DCE-MRI's estimated perfusion values were closer to the reference values than those obtained fromC MRI. In the case of MPRI estimation, theC estimated MPRI values (GRE/bSSFP: 2.3/2.0) more closely align with the literature value (around 3) than the DCE estimated MPRI value (1.6).

Conclusion: This study demonstrated the feasibility of 3D whole-heart myocardial perfusion quantification using hyperpolarized HP001 with both GRE and bSSFP sequences. TheC perfusion measurements underestimated perfusion values compared to theO PET literature value, while theC estimated MPRI value aligned better with the literature. This preliminary result indicatesC imaging may more accurately estimate MPRI values compared to DCE-MRI.

TITLE: Image Translation for Estimating Two-Dimensional Axial Amyloid-Beta PET From Structural MRI

AUTHORS: Fernando Vega, Abdoljalil Addeh, Aravind Ganesh, Eric E Smith, M Ethan MacDonald

JOURNAL: Journal of magnetic resonance imaging : JMRI

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Background: Amyloid-beta and brain atrophy are hallmarks for Alzheimer's Disease that can be targeted with positron emission tomography (PET) and MRI, respectively. MRI is cheaper, less-invasive, and more available than PET. There is a known relationship between amyloid-beta and brain atrophy, meaning PET images could be inferred from MRI.

Purpose: To build an image translation model using a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network able to synthesize Amyloid-beta PET images from structural MRI.

Study type: Retrospective.

Population: Eight hundred eighty-two adults (348 males/534 females) with different stages of cognitive decline (control, mild cognitive impairment, moderate cognitive impairment, and severe cognitive impairment). Five hundred fifty-two subjects for model training and 331 for testing (80%:20%).

Field strength/sequence: 3 T, T1-weighted structural (T1w).

Assessment: The testing cohort was used to evaluate the performance of the model using the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), comparing the likeness of the overall synthetic PET images created from structural MRI with the overall true PET images. SSIM was computed in the overall image to include the luminance, contrast, and structural similarity components. Experienced observers reviewed the images for quality, performance and tried to determine if they could tell the difference between real and synthetic images.

Statistical tests: Pixel wise Pearson correlation was significant, and had an R2greater than 0.96 in example images. From blinded readings, a Pearson Chi-squared test showed that there was no significant difference between the real and synthetic images by the observers (P = 0.68).

Results: A high degree of likeness across the evaluation set, which had a mean SSIM = 0.905 and PSNR = 2.685. The two observers were not able to determine the difference between the real and synthetic images, with accuracies of 54% and 46%, respectively.

Conclusion: Amyloid-beta PET images can be synthesized from structural MRI with a high degree of similarity to the real PET images.

JOURNAL: Medical image analysis

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Inter-frame motion in dynamic cardiac positron emission tomography (PET) using rubidium-82 (82Rb) myocardial perfusion imaging impacts myocardial blood flow (MBF) quantification and the diagnosis accuracy of coronary artery diseases. However, the high cross-frame distribution variation due to rapid tracer kinetics poses a considerable challenge for inter-frame motion correction, especially for early frames where intensity-based image registration techniques often fail. To address this issue, we propose a novel method called Temporally and Anatomically Informed Generative Adversarial Network (TAI-GAN) that utilizes an all-to-one mapping to convert early frames into those with tracer distribution similar to the last reference frame. The TAI-GAN consists of a feature-wise linear modulation layer that encodes channel-wise parameters generated from temporal information and rough cardiac segmentation masks with local shifts that serve as anatomical information. Our proposed method was evaluated on a clinical82Rb PET dataset, and the results show that our TAI-GAN can produce converted early frames with high image quality, comparable to the real reference frames. After TAI-GAN conversion, the motion estimation accuracy and subsequent myocardial blood flow (MBF) quantification with both conventional and deep learning-based motion correction methods were improved compared to using the original frames. The code is available at https://github.com/gxq1998/TAI-GAN.

ABSTRACT:
Attenuation correction remains a challenge in pelvic PET/MRI. In addition to the segmentation/model-based approaches, deep learning methods have shown promise in synthesizing accurate pelvic attenuation maps (μ-maps). However, these methods often misclassify air pockets in the digestive tract, potentially introducing bias in the reconstructed PET images. The aims of this work were to develop deep learning-based methods to automatically segment air pockets and generate pseudo-CT images from CAIPIRINHA-accelerated MR Dixon images.Methods:A convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained to segment air pockets using 3-dimensional CAIPIRINHA-accelerated MR Dixon datasets from 35 subjects and was evaluated against semiautomated segmentations. A separate CNN was trained to synthesize pseudo-CT μ-maps from the Dixon images. Its accuracy was evaluated by comparing the deep learning-, model-, and CT-based μ-maps using data from 30 of the subjects. Finally, the impact of different μ-maps and air pocket segmentation methods on the PET quantification was investigated.Results:Air pockets segmented using the CNN agreed well with semiautomated segmentations, with a mean Dice similarity coefficient of 0.75. The volumetric similarity score between 2 segmentations was 0.85 ± 0.14. The mean absolute relative changes with respect to the CT-based μ-maps were 2.6% and 5.1% in the whole pelvis for the deep learning-based and model-based μ-maps, respectively. The average relative change between PET images reconstructed with deep learning-based and CT-based μ-maps was 2.6%.Conclusion:We developed a deep learning-based method to automatically segment air pockets from CAIPIRINHA-accelerated Dixon images, with accuracy comparable to that of semiautomatic segmentations. The μ-maps synthesized using a deep learning-based method from CAIPIRINHA-accelerated Dixon images were more accurate than those generated with the model-based approach available on integrated PET/MRI scanners.

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

ABSTRACT:
As a non-invasive imaging tool, positron emission tomography (PET) plays an important role in brain science and disease research. Dynamic acquisition is one way of brain PET imaging. Its wide application in clinical research has often been hindered by practical challenges, such as patient involuntary movement, which could degrade both image quality and the accuracy of the quantification. This is even more obvious in scans of patients with neurodegeneration or mental disorders. Conventional motion compensation methods were either based on images or raw measured data, were shown to be able to reduce the effect of motion on the image quality. As for a dynamic PET scan, motion compensation can be challenging as tracer kinetics and relatively high noise can be present in dynamic frames. In this work, we propose an image-based inter-frame motion compensation approach specifically designed for dynamic brain PET imaging. Our method has an iterative implementation that only requires reconstructed images, based on which the inter-frame subject movement can be estimated and compensated. The method utilized tracer-specific kinetic modelling and can deal with simple and complex movement patterns. The synthesized phantom study showed that the proposed method can compensate for the simulated motion in scans with18F-FDG,18F-Fallypride and18F-AV45. Fifteen dynamic18F-FDG patient scans with motion artifacts were also processed. The quality of the recovered image was superior to the one of the non-corrected images and the corrected images with other image-based methods. The proposed method enables retrospective image quality control for dynamic brain PET imaging, hence facilitating the applications of dynamic PET in clinics and research.

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Background: PET/CT images combining anatomic and metabolic data provide complementary information that can improve clinical task performance. PET image segmentation algorithms exploiting the multi-modal information available are still lacking.

Purpose: Our study aimed to assess the performance of PET and CT image fusion for gross tumor volume (GTV) segmentations of head and neck cancers (HNCs) utilizing conventional, deep learning (DL), and output-level voting-based fusions.

Methods: The current study is based on a total of 328 histologically confirmed HNCs from six different centers. The images were automatically cropped to a 200 × 200 head and neck region box, and CT and PET images were normalized for further processing. Eighteen conventional image-level fusions were implemented. In addition, a modified U2-Net architecture as DL fusion model baseline was used. Three different input, layer, and decision-level information fusions were used. Simultaneous truth and performance level estimation (STAPLE) and majority voting to merge different segmentation outputs (from PET and image-level and network-level fusions), that is, output-level information fusion (voting-based fusions) were employed. Different networks were trained in a 2D manner with a batch size of 64. Twenty percent of the dataset with stratification concerning the centers (20% in each center) were used for final result reporting. Different standard segmentation metrics and conventional PET metrics, such as SUV, were calculated.

Results: In single modalities, PET had a reasonable performance with a Dice score of 0.77 ± 0.09, while CT did not perform acceptably and reached a Dice score of only 0.38 ± 0.22. Conventional fusion algorithms obtained a Dice score range of [0.76-0.81] with guided-filter-based context enhancement (GFCE) at the low-end, and anisotropic diffusion and Karhunen-Loeve transform fusion (ADF), multi-resolution singular value decomposition (MSVD), and multi-level image decomposition based on latent low-rank representation (MDLatLRR) at the high-end. All DL fusion models achieved Dice scores of 0.80. Output-level voting-based models outperformed all other models, achieving superior results with a Dice score of 0.84 for Majority_ImgFus, Majority_All, and Majority_Fast. A mean error of almost zero was achieved for all fusions using SUVpeak, SUVmeanand SUVmedian.

Conclusion: PET/CT information fusion adds significant value to segmentation tasks, considerably outperforming PET-only and CT-only methods. In addition, both conventional image-level and DL fusions achieve competitive results. Meanwhile, output-level voting-based fusion using majority voting of several algorithms results in statistically significant improvements in the segmentation of HNC.

ABSTRACT:
This article presents the protocol on Quality Controls in PET/CT and PET/MRI published online in May 2022 by the European Federation of Organisations for Medical Physics (EFOMP), which was developed by the Working group for PET/CT and PET/MRI Quality Control (QC) protocol. The main objective of this protocol was to comprehensively provide simple and practical procedures that may be integrated into clinical practice to identify changes in the PET/CT/MRI system's performance and avoid short- and long-term quality deterioration. The protocol describes the quality control procedures on radionuclide calibrators, weighing scales, PET, CT and MRI systems using selected and measurable parameters that are directly linked to clinical images quality. It helps to detect problems before they can impact clinical studies in terms of safety, image quality, quantification accuracy and patient radiation dose. CT and MRI QCs are described only in the context of their use for PET (attenuation correction and anatomical localization) imaging. Detailed step-by-step instructions have been provided, limiting any misinterpretations or interpersonal variations as much as possible. This paper presents the main characteristics of the protocol illustrated together with a brief summary of the content of each chapter. A regular QC based on the proposed protocol would guarantee that PET/CT and PET/MRI systems operate under optimal conditions, resulting in the best performance for routine clinical tasks.

TITLE: Knowledge relay: Synergetic generation and transfer learning for pancreatic tumor segmentation on multimodal images

AUTHORS: Shuiping Gou, Ningtao Liu, Wenbo Liu, Yao Yao

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Background: Pancreatic cancer is among the most lethal malignancies, with the lowest survival rates. The use of image-guided radiotherapy has shown significant potential in enhancing surgical outcomes for pancreatic cancer. However, accurate segmentation of pancreatic tumors prior to radiotherapy remains a challenge due to the small size, irregular shape, and indistinct boundaries of the pancreas and tumor in monomodal imaging. Furthermore, the availability of multimodal images that meet the requirements for precise pancreatic segmentation is highly limited, leading to the datasets that fail to provide comprehensive knowledge for effective image representation in pancreatic tumor segmentation.

Purpose: This study aims to develop a method for accurately segmenting pancreatic tumors under very harsh data conditions, in which the currently available datasets are fragmented with the issues, such as limited sample sizes, inconsistent lesion matching, and incomplete modalities.

Methods: We propose a knowledge relay framework that leverages synergistic generation and transfer learning strategies. The relay comprises three batons: pancreatic PET image generation, coarse detection, and fine segmentation. Multimodal images, including CT, MR, and PET from three separate datasets, are integrated within this framework. The knowledge contained in each dataset is sequentially transferred and aggregated through the batons by the strategies of transfer learning and fine-tuning. Additionally, we introduce a mask-constrained CycleGAN and an inter-attention UNet within this framework to enhance the extraction and utilization of knowledge for accurate pancreatic tumor segmentation.

Results: The proposed knowledge relay framework achieves the state-of-the-art performance in pancreatic tumor segmentation on PET/MR images. On the images collected from 19 subjects, our method attained aof 80.06%,of 83.39%,of 99.81%,of 4.87, andof 12.69.

Conclusions: The results of comparison and ablation experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed knowledge relay framework in extracting and integrating knowledge from fragmented datasets under constrained conditions. The comprehensive and enriched knowledge significantly enhances the accuracy of pancreatic tumor segmentation.

TITLE: Impact of irregular waveforms on data-driven respiratory gated PET/CT images processed using MotionFree algorithm

AUTHORS: Noriaki Miyaji, Kenta Miwa, Kosuke Yamashita, Kazuki Motegi, Kei Wagatsuma, Yuto Kamitaka, Tensho Yamao, Mitsutomi Ishiyama, Takashi Terauchi

JOURNAL: Annals of nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Objectives: MotionFree® (AMF) is a data-driven respiratory gating (DDG) algorithm for image processing that has recently been introduced into clinical practice. The present study aimed to verify the accuracy of respiratory waveform and the effects of normal and irregular respiratory motions using AMF with the DDG algorithm.

Methods: We used a NEMA IEC body phantom comprising six spheres (37-, 28-, 22-, 17-, 13-, and 10 mm diameter) containing18F. The sphere-to-background ratio was 4:1 (21.2 and 5.3 kBq/mL). We acquired PET/CT images from a stationary or moving phantom placed on a custom-designed motion platform. Respiratory motions were reproduced based on normal (sinusoidal or expiratory-paused waveforms) and irregular (changed amplitude or shifted baseline waveforms) movements. The "width" parameters in AMF were set at 10-60% and extracted data during the expiratory phases of each waveform. We verified the accuracy of the derived waveforms by comparing those input from the motion platform and output determined using AMF. Quantitative accuracy was evaluated as recovery coefficients (RCs), improvement rate, and %change that were calculated based on sphere diameter or width. We evaluated statistical differences in activity concentrations of each sphere between normal and irregular waveforms.

Results: Respiratory waveforms derived from AMF were almost identical to the input waveforms on the motion platform. Although the RCs in each sphere for expiratory-paused and ideal stationary waveforms were almost identical, RCs except the expiratory-paused waveform were lower than those for the stationary waveform. The improvement rate decreased more for the irregular, than the normal waveforms with AMF in smaller spheres. The %change was improved by decreasing the width of waveforms with a shifted baseline. Activity concentrations significantly differed between normal waveforms and those with a shifted baseline in spheres < 28 mm.

Conclusions: The PET images using AMF with the DDG algorithm provided the precise waveform of respiratory motions and the improvement of quantitative accuracy in the four types of respiratory waveforms. The improvement rate was the most obvious in expiratory-paused waveforms, and the most subtle in those with a shifted baseline. Optimizing the width parameter in irregular waveform will benefit patients who breathe like the waveform with the shifted baseline.

TITLE: Impact of tracer uptake rate on quantification accuracy of myocardial blood flow in PET: A simulation study

AUTHORS: Xiaotong Hong, Amirhossein Sanaat, Yazdan Salimi, René Nkoulou, Hossein Arabi, Lijun Lu, Habib Zaidi

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Background: Cardiac perfusion PET is commonly used to assess ischemia and cardiovascular risk, which enables quantitative measurements of myocardial blood flow (MBF) through kinetic modeling. However, the estimation of kinetic parameters is challenging due to the noisy nature of short dynamic frames and limited sample data points.

Purpose: This work aimed to investigate the errors in MBF estimation in PET through a simulation study and to evaluate different parameter estimation approaches, including a deep learning (DL) method.

Materials and methods: Simulated studies were generated using digital phantoms based on cardiac segmentations from 55 clinical CT images. We employed the irreversible 2-tissue compartmental model and simulated dynamic13N-ammonia PET scans under both rest and stress conditions (220 cases each). The simulations covered a rest K1range of 0.6 to 1.2 and a stress K1range of 1.2 to 3.6 (unit: mL/min/g) in the myocardium. A transformer-based DL model was trained on the simulated dataset to predict parametric images (PIMs) from noisy PET image frames and was validated using 5-fold cross-validation. We compared the DL method with the voxel-wise nonlinear least squares (NLS) fitting applied to the dynamic images, using either Gaussian filter (GF) smoothing (GF-NLS) or a dynamic nonlocal means (DNLM) algorithm for denoising (DNLM-NLS). Two patients with coronary CT angiography (CTA) and fractional flow reserve (FFR) were enrolled to test the feasibility of applying DL models on clinical PET data.

Results: The DL method showed clearer image structures with reduced noise compared to the traditional NLS-based methods. In terms of mean absolute relative error (MARE), as the rest K1values increased from 0.6 to 1.2 mL/min/g, the overall bias in myocardium K1estimates decreased from approximately 58% to 45% for the NLS-based methods while the DL method showed a reduction in MARE from 42% to 18%. For stress data, as the stress K1decreased from 3.6 to 1.2 mL/min/g, the MARE increased from 30% to 70% for the GF-NLS method. In contrast, both the DNLM-NLS (average: 42%) and the DL methods (average: 20%) demonstrated significantly smaller MARE changes as stress K1varied. Regarding the regional mean bias (±standard deviation), the GF-NLS method had a bias of 6.30% (±8.35%) of rest K1, compared to 1.10% (±8.21%) for DNLM-NLS and 6.28% (±14.05%) for the DL method. For the stress K1, the GF-NLS showed a mean bias of 10.72% (±9.34%) compared to 1.69% (±8.82%) for DNLM-NLS and -10.55% (±9.81%) for the DL method.

Significance: This study showed that an increase in the tracer uptake rate (K1) corresponded to improved accuracy and precision in MBF quantification, whereas lower tracer uptake resulted in higher noise in dynamic PET and poorer parameter estimates. Utilizing denoising techniques or DL approaches can mitigate noise-induced bias in PET parametric imaging.

TITLE: Evaluation of repeatability and reproducibility of radiomic features produced by the fan-beam kV-CT on a novel ring gantry-based PET/CT linear accelerator

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Background: The RefleXion X1 is a novel radiotherapy delivery system on a ring gantry equipped with fan-beam kV-CT and PET imaging subsystems. The day-to-day scanning variability of radiomics features must be evaluated before any attempt to utilize radiomics features.

Purpose: This study aims to characterize the repeatability and reproducibility of radiomic features produced by the RefleXion X1 kV-CT.

Materials and methods: The Credence Cartridge Radiomics (CCR) phantom includes six cartridges of varied materials. It was scanned 10 times on the RefleXion X1 kVCT imaging subsystem over a 3-month period using the two most frequently used scanning protocols (BMS and BMF). Fifty-five radiomic features were extracted for each ROI on each CT scan and analyzed using LifeX software. The coefficient of variation (COV) was computed to evaluate the repeatability. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) were used to evaluate the repeatability and reproducibility of the scanned images using 0.9 as the threshold. This process is repeated on a GE PET-CT scanner using several built-in protocols as a comparison.

Results: On average, 87% of the features on both scan protocols on the RefleXion X1 kVCT imaging subsystem can be considered repeatable as they met COV < 10% criteria. On GE PET-CT, this number is similar at 86%. When we tighten the criteria to COV <5%, the RefleXion X1 kVCT imaging subsystem showed much better repeatability with 81% of features on average whereas GE PET-CT showed only 73.5% on average. About 91% and 89% of the features with ICC > 0.9 respectively for BMS and BMF protocols on RefleXion X1. On the other hand, the percentage of features with ICC > 0.9 on GE PET-CT ranges from 67% to 82%. The RefleXion X1 kVCT imaging subsystem showed excellent intra-scanner reproducibility between the scanning protocols much better than the GE PET CT scanner. For the inter-scanner reproducibility, the percentage of features with CCC > 0.9 ranged from 49% to 80%. between X1 and GE PET-CT scanning protocols.

Conclusions: Clinically useful CT radiomic features produced by the RefleXion X1 kVCT imaging subsystem are reproducible and stable over time, demonstrating its utility as a quantitative imaging platform.

TITLE: Spatial normalization and quantification approaches of PET imaging for neurological disorders

AUTHORS: Teng Zhang, Shuang Wu, Xiaohui Zhang, Yiwu Dai, Anxin Wang, Hong Zhang, Mei Tian

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Quantification approaches of positron emission tomography (PET) imaging provide user-independent evaluation of pathophysiological processes in living brains, which have been strongly recommended in clinical diagnosis of neurological disorders. Most PET quantification approaches depend on spatial normalization of PET images to brain template; however, the spatial normalization and quantification approaches have not been comprehensively reviewed. In this review, we introduced and compared PET template-based and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-aided spatial normalization approaches. Tracer-specific and age-specific PET brain templates were surveyed between 1999 and 2021 for18F-FDG,11C-PIB,18F-Florbetapir,18F-THK5317, and etc., as well as adaptive PET template methods. Spatial normalization-based PET quantification approaches were reviewed, including region-of-interest (ROI)-based and voxel-wise quantitative methods. Spatial normalization-based ROI segmentation approaches were introduced, including manual delineation on template, atlas-based segmentation, and multi-atlas approach. Voxel-wise quantification approaches were reviewed, including voxel-wise statistics and principal component analysis. Certain concerns and representative examples of clinical applications were provided for both ROI-based and voxel-wise quantification approaches. At last, a recipe for PET spatial normalization and quantification approaches was concluded to improve diagnosis accuracy of neurological disorders in clinical practice.

TITLE: Assessment of dual time point protocols to produce parametric Ki images in FDG PET/CT: A virtual clinical study

AUTHORS: Niloufar Reshtebar, Seyed Abolfazl Hosseini, Mingzan Zhuang, Arman Rahmim, Nicolas A Karakatsanis, Peyman Sheikhzadeh

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: This simulation study investigated the feasibility of generating Patlak Kiimages using a dual time point (DTP-Ki) scan protocol involving two 3-min/bed routine static PET scans and, subsequently, assessed DTP-Kiperformance for an optimal DTP scan time frame combination, against conventional Patlak Kiestimated from complete 0-93 min dynamic PET data.

Methods: Six realistic heterogeneous tumors of different characteristic spatiotemporal [18F]FDG uptake distributions for three noise levels commonly found in clinical studies and 20 noise realizations (N = 360 samples) were produced by analytic simulations of the XCAT phantom. Subsequently, DTP-Kiimages were generated by performing standard linear indirect Patlak analysis with t*-min (Patlakt* = 12) using a scaled population-based input function (sPBIF) model on 66 combinations of early and late 3-min/bed static whole-body PET reconstructed images. All DTP-Kiimages were evaluated against respective DTP-Kiimages estimated with Patlakt* = 12and 0-93 min individual input functions (iIFs) and against gold standard Kiimages estimated with Patlakt* = 12, 0-93 min iIFs and tissue time activity curves from all reconstructed WB passes 12-93 min post injection. The optimal combination of early and late frames, in terms of attaining the highest correlation between DTP-Kiwith sPBIF and gold standard Kiwas also determined from a set of 66 different combinations of 2-min early and late frames. Moreover, the performance of DTP-Kiwith sPBIF was compared against that of the retention index (RI) in terms of their correlation to the gold standard Ki. Finally, the feasibility and practicality of DTP protocol in the clinic were assessed through the analysis of nine patients.

Results: High correlations (>0.9) were observed between DTP-Kivalues from sPBIF and those from iIFs for all evaluated DTP protocols while the mean AUC difference between sPBIF and iIFs was less than 10%. The percentage difference of mean values between DTP-Kifrom sPBIF and from iIFs was less than 1%. DTP Kifrom sPBIF exhibited significantly higher correlation with gold standard Ki, in contrast to RI, across all 66 DTP protocols (p < 0.05 using the two-tailed t-test by Williams) with the highest correlation attained for the 50-53-min early + 90-93-min late scan time frames (optimal DTP protocol).

Conclusion: Feasibility of generating Patlak Ki[18F] FDG images from an early and a late post injection 3-min/bed routine static scan using a population-based input function model was demonstrated and an optimal DTP scan protocol was determined. The results indicated high correlations between DTP-Kiand gold-standard Kiimages that are significantly larger than those between RI and gold-standard Ki.

JOURNAL: Molecular imaging and biology

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: To ensure comparable PET/CT image quality between or within centres, clinical inter-system performance comparisons following European Association of Nuclear Medicine Research Ltd. (EARL) guidelines is required. In this work the performance of the long axial field-of-view Biograph Vision Quadra is compared to its predecessor, the short axial field-of-view Biograph Vision.

Procedures: To this aim, patients with suspected tumour lesions received a single weight-based (3 MBq/kg) 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose injection and underwent routine clinical (∼15 min) scans on the Vision and 3-min scans on the Quadra in listmode in balanced order. Image quality (IQ), image noise (IN), and tumour demarcation (TD) were assessed visually by four nuclear medicine physicians using a 5-point Likert scale and semiquantitative analysis was performed using standardised uptake values (SUVs). Inter-reader agreement was tested using Wilcoxon's signed rank test and the SUVs were statistically compared using a paired t-test.

Results: Twenty patients (mean age, 60 years ± 8.8 [standard deviation], 16 male) were enrolled. Inter-reader agreement ranged from good to very good for IQ and IN (0.62 ≤ W ≤ 0.81), and fair for TD (0.29 ≤ W ≤ 0.39). Furthermore, a significant difference was found for TD (p = 0.015) between the systems, showing improved TD for the Quadra.

Conclusion: This study demonstrates that the Quadra can be used in routine clinical practice with multiple PET/CT systems or in multicentre studies. This system provides comparable diagnostic image quality and semiquantitative accuracy, improved TD, and has the advantage of shorter scan durations.

TITLE: SiPM signal readout for inter-crystal scatter event identification in PET detectors

AUTHORS: Haewook Park, Jae Sung Lee

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
In positron emission tomography (PET) with pixelated detectors, a significant number of annihilation photons interact with scintillation crystals through single or multiple Compton scattering events. When these partial energy depositions occur across multiple crystal elements, we call them inter-crystal scatter (ICS) events. ICS events lead to incorrect localization of the annihilation photons, thereby degrading the PET image contrast, spatial resolution, and lesion detectability. The accurate identification of ICS events is the first essential step to improve the quality of PET images by rejecting ICS events or recovering ICS events without losing PET sensitivity. In this study, we propose a novel silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) readout method to identify ICS events in one-to-one coupled PET detectors with a reduced number of data acquisition channels. For concept verification, we assembled a PET detector that consists of a 16-channel SiPM array and 4 [Formula: see text] 4 lutetium oxyorthosilicate (LSO) array with a 3.2 mm crystal pitch. The proposed SiPM readout scheme serializes the 16 SiPM anode signals into four pulse train outputs encoded with four increasing time-delays in steps of 250 ns intervals. A Sum signal of the 16 SiPM anodes provides the timing information for time-of-flight measurement and a trigger signal for coincidence detection. A time-over-threshold (TOT) method was applied for obtaining the energy information followed by a subsequent TOT-to-energy calibration. We successfully identified the ICS events and determined their interacted positions and deposited energies by analyzing the digital pulses from the four pulse train output channels. The occurrence rate of ICS events was 10.85% for the 4 × 4 PET detector module with 3.2 mm-pitch LSO crystals. The PET detector yielded an energy resolution of 10.9 [Formula: see text] 0.6% and coincidence timing resolution of 285 [Formula: see text] 12 ps FWHM. We expect that the proposed method can be a useful solution for alleviating the readout burden of SiPM-based PET scanners with ICS event identification capability.

TITLE: A cycle-consistent adversarial network for brain PET partial volume correction without prior anatomical information

AUTHORS: Amirhossein Sanaat, Hossein Shooli, Andrew Stephen Böhringer, Maryam Sadeghi, Isaac Shiri, Yazdan Salimi, Nathalie Ginovart, Valentina Garibotto, Hossein Arabi, Habib Zaidi

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Partial volume effect (PVE) is a consequence of the limited spatial resolution of PET scanners. PVE can cause the intensity values of a particular voxel to be underestimated or overestimated due to the effect of surrounding tracer uptake. We propose a novel partial volume correction (PVC) technique to overcome the adverse effects of PVE on PET images.

Methods: Two hundred and twelve clinical brain PET scans, including 5018F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG), 5018F-Flortaucipir, 3618F-Flutemetamol, and 7618F-FluoroDOPA, and their corresponding T1-weighted MR images were enrolled in this study. The Iterative Yang technique was used for PVC as a reference or surrogate of the ground truth for evaluation. A cycle-consistent adversarial network (CycleGAN) was trained to directly map non-PVC PET images to PVC PET images. Quantitative analysis using various metrics, including structural similarity index (SSIM), root mean squared error (RMSE), and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), was performed. Furthermore, voxel-wise and region-wise-based correlations of activity concentration between the predicted and reference images were evaluated through joint histogram and Bland and Altman analysis. In addition, radiomic analysis was performed by calculating 20 radiomic features within 83 brain regions. Finally, a voxel-wise two-sample t-test was used to compare the predicted PVC PET images with reference PVC images for each radiotracer.

Results: The Bland and Altman analysis showed the largest and smallest variance for18F-FDG (95% CI: - 0.29, + 0.33 SUV, mean = 0.02 SUV) and18F-Flutemetamol (95% CI: - 0.26, + 0.24 SUV, mean = - 0.01 SUV), respectively. The PSNR was lowest (29.64 ± 1.13 dB) for18F-FDG and highest (36.01 ± 3.26 dB) for18F-Flutemetamol. The smallest and largest SSIM were achieved for18F-FDG (0.93 ± 0.01) and18F-Flutemetamol (0.97 ± 0.01), respectively. The average relative error for the kurtosis radiomic feature was 3.32%, 9.39%, 4.17%, and 4.55%, while it was 4.74%, 8.80%, 7.27%, and 6.81% for NGLDM_contrast feature for18F-Flutemetamol,18F-FluoroDOPA,18F-FDG, and18F-Flortaucipir, respectively.

Conclusion: An end-to-end CycleGAN PVC method was developed and evaluated. Our model generates PVC images from the original non-PVC PET images without requiring additional anatomical information, such as MRI or CT. Our model eliminates the need for accurate registration or segmentation or PET scanner system response characterization. In addition, no assumptions regarding anatomical structure size, homogeneity, boundary, or background level are required.

TITLE: CNN-Based Cross-Modal Residual Network for Image Synthesis

AUTHORS: Rajeev Kumar, Vaibhav Bhatnagar, Amit Jain, Mahesh Singh, Z H Kareem, R Sugumar

JOURNAL: BioMed research international

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
This study attempts to address the issue that present cross-modal image synthesis algorithms do not capture the spatial and structural information of human tissues effectively. As a consequence, the resulting photos include flaws including fuzzy edges and a poor signal-to-noise ratio. The authors offer a cross-sectional technique that combines residual modules with generative adversarial networks. The approach incorporates an enhanced residual initial module and attention mechanism into the generator network, reducing the number of parameters and improving the generator's feature learning capabilities. To boost discriminant performance, the discriminator employs a multiscale discriminator. A multilevel structural similarity loss is included in the loss function to improve picture contrast preservation. On the ADNI data set, the algorithm is compared to the mainstream algorithms. The experimental findings reveal that the synthetic PET image's MAE index has dropped while the SSIM and PSNR indexes have improved. The experimental findings suggest that the proposed model may maintain picture structural information while improving image quality in both visual and objective measures. The residue initial module and attention mechanism are employed to increase the generator's capacity for learning, while the multiscale discriminator is utilized to improve the model's discriminative performance. The enhanced method in this study can maintain the structure and contrast information of the picture, according to comparative experimental findings using the ADNI dataset. The produced picture is hence more aesthetically similar to the genuine print.

TITLE: Full-dose whole-body PET synthesis from low-dose PET using high-efficiency denoising diffusion probabilistic model: PET consistency model

AUTHORS: Shaoyan Pan, Elham Abouei, Junbo Peng, Joshua Qian, Jacob F Wynne, Tonghe Wang, Chih-Wei Chang, Justin Roper, Jonathon A Nye, Hui Mao, Xiaofeng Yang

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Positron Emission Tomography (PET) has been a commonly used imaging modality in broad clinical applications. One of the most important tradeoffs in PET imaging is between image quality and radiation dose: high image quality comes with high radiation exposure. Improving image quality is desirable for all clinical applications while minimizing radiation exposure is needed to reduce risk to patients.

Methods: We introduce PET Consistency Model (PET-CM), an efficient diffusion-based method for generating high-quality full-dose PET images from low-dose PET images. It employs a two-step process, adding Gaussian noise to full-dose PET images in the forward diffusion, and then denoising them using a PET Shifted-window Vision Transformer (PET-VIT) network in the reverse diffusion. The PET-VIT network learns a consistency function that enables direct denoising of Gaussian noise into clean full-dose PET images. PET-CM achieves state-of-the-art image quality while requiring significantly less computation time than other methods. Evaluation with normalized mean absolute error (NMAE), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), multi-scale structure similarity index (SSIM), normalized cross-correlation (NCC), and clinical evaluation including Human Ranking Score (HRS) and Standardized Uptake Value (SUV) Error analysis shows its superiority in synthesizing full-dose PET images from low-dose inputs.

Results: In experiments comparing eighth-dose to full-dose images, PET-CM demonstrated impressive performance with NMAE of 1.278 ± 0.122%, PSNR of 33.783 ± 0.824 dB, SSIM of 0.964 ± 0.009, NCC of 0.968 ± 0.011, HRS of 4.543, and SUV Error of 0.255 ± 0.318%, with an average generation time of 62 s per patient. This is a significant improvement compared to the state-of-the-art diffusion-based model with PET-CM reaching this result 12× faster. Similarly, in the quarter-dose to full-dose image experiments, PET-CM delivered competitive outcomes, achieving an NMAE of 0.973 ± 0.066%, PSNR of 36.172 ± 0.801 dB, SSIM of 0.984 ± 0.004, NCC of 0.990 ± 0.005, HRS of 4.428, and SUV Error of 0.151 ± 0.192% using the same generation process, which underlining its high quantitative and clinical precision in both denoising scenario.

Conclusions: We propose PET-CM, the first efficient diffusion-model-based method, for estimating full-dose PET images from low-dose images. PET-CM provides comparable quality to the state-of-the-art diffusion model with higher efficiency. By utilizing this approach, it becomes possible to maintain high-quality PET images suitable for clinical use while mitigating the risks associated with radiation.

TITLE: Whole-body CT-to-PET synthesis using a customized transformer-enhanced GAN

AUTHORS: Bangyan Xu, Ziwei Nie, Jian He, Aimei Li, Ting Wu

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Background. Positron emission tomography with 2-deoxy-2-[fluorine-18]fluoro-D-glucose integrated with computed tomography (18F-FDG PET-CT) is a multi-modality medical imaging technique widely used for screening and diagnosis of lesions and tumors, in which, CT can provide detailed anatomical structures, while PET can show metabolic activities. Nevertheless, it has disadvantages such as long scanning time, high cost, and relatively high radiation doses.Purpose. We propose a deep learning model for the whole-body CT-to-PET synthesis task, generating high-quality synthetic PET images that are comparable to real ones in both clinical relevance and diagnostic value.Material. We collect 102 pairs of 3D CT and PET scans, which are sliced into 27 240 pairs of 2D CT and PET images (training: 21,855 pairs, validation: 2810 pairs, testing: 2575 pairs).Methods. We propose a transformer-enhanced generative adversarial network (GAN) for whole-body CT-to-PET synthesis task. The CPGAN model uses residual blocks and fully connected transformer residual blocks to capture both local features and global contextual information. A customized loss function incorporating structural consistency is designed to improve the quality of synthesized PET images.Results. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluation results demonstrate effectiveness of the CPGAN model. The mean and standard variance of NRMSE, PSNR and SSIM values on test set are(16.90±12.27)×10-4,28.71±2.67and0.926±0.033, respectively, outperforming other seven state-of-the-art models. Three radiologists independently and blindly evaluated and gave subjective scores to 100 randomly chosen PET images (50 real and 50 synthetic). By Wilcoxon signed rank test, there are no statistical differences between the synthetic PET images and the real ones.Conclusions. Despite the inherent limitations of CT images to directly reflect biological information of metabolic tissues, CPGAN model effectively synthesizes satisfying PET images from CT scans, which has potential in reducing the reliance on actual PET-CT scans.

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear medicine technology

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
18F-FDG PET/CT is crucial for cancer diagnosis; however, respiratory motion often causes misregistration between PET and CT images. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of a custom-made respiratory motion reduction block (RRB) in reducing misregistration and improving image quality in18F-FDG PET/CT.Methods:The RRB was developed to minimize the effects of respiratory motion. It is a pentagonal block made of Styrofoam designed to compress the upper abdomen. This study included 170 patients who underwent whole-body18F-FDG PET/CT. Patients were categorized into 4 groups based on the CT and PET scanning technique used: a control free-breathing (FB) group (breath-holding [BH] CT without RRB and respiration-gated [RG] PET), a control RG group (BH CT without RRB with RG PET), a BH RRB group (BH CT with RRB), and a FB RRB group (FB CT with RRB). Various parameters, including the incidence rate and distance of anatomic misregistration, and signal-to-noise ratio, were measured and compared.Results:For the control FB, control RG, BH RRB, and FB RRB groups, the incidence rates of anatomic misregistration between PET and CT images were 47.1%, 27.5%, 34.0%, and 16.7%, respectively. The mean misregistration distances in these groups were 5.1 ± 6.0, 3.1 ± 5.5, 3.8 ± 6.2, and 1.3 ± 3.2 mm, respectively. Furthermore, the RRB improved the signal-to-noise ratio of the liver.Conclusion:The RRB effectively improved registration between PET and CT images. Our approach is cost-effective and provides respiratory motion suppression not only during PET but also during CT scans. The use of RRB with FB PET scanning was found to be more beneficial than respiratory gating.

TITLE: Composite attenuation correction method using a 68Ge-transmission multi-atlas for quantitative brain PET/MR

AUTHORS: João M Sousa, Lieuwe Appel, Mathias Engström, Stergios Papadimitriou, Dag Nyholm, Håkan Ahlström, Mark Lubberink

ABSTRACT:
In positron emission tomography (PET),68Ge-transmission scanning is considered the gold standard in attenuation correction (AC) though not available in current dual imaging systems. In this experimental study we evaluated a novel AC method for PET/magnetic resonance (MR) imaging which is essentially based on a composite database of multiple68Ge-transmission maps and T1-weighted (T1w) MR image-pairs (composite transmission, CTR-AC). This proof-of-concept study used retrospectively a database with 125 pairs of co-registered68Ge-AC maps and T1w MR images from anatomical normal subjects and a validation dataset comprising dynamic [11C]PE2I PET data from nine patients with Parkinsonism. CTR-AC maps were generated by non-rigid image registration of all database T1w MRI to each subject's T1w, applying the same transformation to every68Ge-AC map, and averaging the resulting68Ge-AC maps. [11C]PE2I PET images were reconstructed using CTR-AC and a patient-specific68Ge-AC map as the reference standard. Standardized uptake values (SUV) and quantitative parameters of kinetic analysis were compared, i.e., relative delivery (R1) and non-displaceable binding potential (BPND). CTR-AC showed high accuracy for whole-brain SUV (mean %bias ± SD: 0.5 ± 3.5%), whole-brain R1(-0.1 ± 3.2%), and putamen BPND(3.7 ± 8.1%). SUV and R1precision (SD of %bias) were modest and lowest in the anterior cortex, with an R1%bias of -1.1 ± 6.4%). The prototype CTR-AC is capable of providing accurate MRAC-maps with continuous linear attenuation coefficients though still experimental. The method's accuracy is comparable to the best MRAC methods published so far, both in SUV and as found for ZTE-AC in quantitative parameters of kinetic modelling.

TITLE: Structural semantic-guided MR synthesis from PET images via a dual cross-attention mechanism

AUTHORS: Hongyan Tang, Wenbo Li, Zhenxing Huang, Yaping Wu, Jianmin Yuan, Yang Yang, Yan Zhang, Yongfeng Yang, Hairong Zheng, Dong Liang, Meiyun Wang, Zhanli Hu

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Background: Multimodal medical imaging methods, such as positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT), are widely used for diagnosing diseases because they provide both structural and functional information. However, PET/CT has limitations in terms of visualizing soft tissues, particularly for brain diseases, which highlights the need for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

Purpose: Given the limited adoption of PET/ magnetic resonance (MR) devices for making MR images available and the discomfort of elderly cancer patients during long-term MR scanning, a promising solution is to develop methods for synthesizing MR images from other modalities. While previous research has focused mainly on structure-to-structure modality transitions, such as CT-to-MR synthesis, our study aims to explore a new function-to-structure transition approach to realize PET-to-MR synthesis. Specifically, we propose a structural semantic-guided deep learning network to synthesize MR images from PET data to simplify medical imaging processes, improving both efficiency and accessibility.

Methods: We propose a structural semantic-guided deep learning network with a dual cross-attention (DCA) module to synthesize MR images from PET data for realizing the function-to-structure modality transition. The network introduces a structural semantic loss to preserve structural information and details, and the DCA module utilizes cross-attention to effectively capture the channel and spatial interdependencies among multiscale features. The proposed method was compared with other deep learning-based methods, including 3DUXNET, UNETR, nnFormer, CycleGAN, Pix2pix, edge-aware generative adversarial network (Ea-GAN), and MedNet. Additionally, visual and quantitative analysis was employed to evaluate the model performance. Furthermore, correlation analysis based on pixel averages, semantic assessment, and additional data assessment was performed for the quantitative evaluation of image synthesis results. Additionally, an ablation experiment was conducted to validate the effectiveness of introducing structural semantic loss and the DCA module in enhancing model performance.

Results: The experiments demonstrate that the proposed method yields superior visual and quantitative outcomes, with a peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of 29.09 dB, a structural similarity index measure (SSIM) of 0.8417, and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.0296. Additionally, the correlation analysis based on pixel averages shows a fitted slope of 0.957 in the left caudate region, and the semantic segmentation results reveal a Dice score of 0.8977 in the left thalamus proper. These findings indicate that the synthetic images generated by the proposed method are consistent with the ground truth (GT) and preserve the structural semantic information. Furthermore, an ablation analysis reveals that both the introduction of the structural semantic loss and the incorporation of the DCA module could enhance model performance.

Conclusion: We propose a synthesis method by introducing structural semantic loss to preserve semantic information and incorporating attention mechanisms into the synthesis network to capture global information. Visual, quantitative, and segmentation semantic results illustrate that the proposed method achieves excellent performance in image synthesis. In future work, we will try to utilize our synthesis method in other modal synthesis tasks and in clinical practice.

TITLE: Can alternative PET reconstruction schemes improve the prognostic value of radiomic features in non-small cell lung cancer?

AUTHORS: Olena Tankyevych, Florent Tixier, Nils Antonorsi, Anas Filali Razzouki, Raphael Mondon, Thomas Pinto-Leite, Dimitris Visvikis, Mathieu Hatt, Catherine Cheze Le Rest

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: To evaluate the potential benefit of using alternative reconstruction schemes of PET images for the prognostic value of radiomic features.

Methods: Patients (n=91) with non-small cell lung cancer were prospectively included. All had a PET/CT examination before treatment. Three different PET images were reconstructed for each patient: the standard clinical protocol (i.e., 4×4×4 mm3voxels, 5mm Gaussian filter, denoted '200G5'), as well as using smaller voxels (i.e., 2×2×2 mm3with a larger reconstruction matrix, denoted 400G1) and/or 1mm post-reconstruction Gaussian filter, denoted 200G1). Metabolic volumes of the primary tumors were semi-automatically delineated on the PET images and IBSI compliant radiomic features (intensity, shape, textural) were extracted. First, the distributions of 200G1 and 400G1 features were compared to the reference clinical protocol (200G5) through Bland-Altman tests and the use of linear mixed models. Then, the prognostic value of the features from each of the 3 reconstructions was evaluated in a univariate analysis, through their stratification power in Kaplan-Meier curves through a threshold set at the median.

Results: The 3 reconstructions led to different distributions for most of the features. The larger shifts and standard deviations of differences was observed between 200G5 and 400G1, which was also confirmed through linear mixed models. However, these relatively important differences in distributions did not translate into a significant impact on the stratification power of the features in terms of prognosis, although a trend in decreasing prognostic value could be observed (smaller number of features with HR above 2, overall lower HR values). Most prognostic features displayed high correlation with either volume or SUVmax, although there was great variability of prognostic value for similar levels of correlation with these basic metrics.

Conclusions: Using smaller voxels or less strong filtering options in the reconstruction settings of PET images compared to the standard clinical protocols led to different distributions of the resulting radiomic features. However, the hierarchy between patients according to these distributions remained overall the same and therefore the resulting stratification power of the radiomic features was not significantly altered. These results should be compared to those obtained in the context of other pathologies where radiomic features displaying lower correlation with volume or SUVmaxmay have predictive value, such as in cervical cancer.

ABSTRACT:
Background: Brain-dedicated positron emission tomography (PET) systems offer high spatial resolution and sensitivity for accurate clinical assessments. Attenuation correction (AC) is important in PET imaging, particularly in brain studies. This study assessed the reproducibility of attenuation maps (µ-maps) generated by a specialized time-of-flight (TOF) brain-dedicated PET system for imaging using different PET tracers.

Methods: Twelve subjects underwent both18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET and18F-flutemetamol (FMM) amyloid-PET scans. Images were reconstructed with µ-maps obtained by a maximum likelihood-based AC method. Voxel-based and region-based analyses were used to compare µ-maps obtained with FDG-PET versus FMM-PET; FDG-PET images reconstructed using an FDG-PET µ-map (FDG × FDG) versus those reconstructed with an FMM-PET µ-map (FDG × FMM); and FMM-PET images reconstructed using an FDG-PET µ-map (FMM × FDG) versus those reconstructed with an FMM-PET µ-map (FMM × FMM).

Results: Small but significant differences in µ-maps were observed between tracers, primarily in bone regions. In the comparison between the µ-maps obtained with FDG-PET and FMM-PET, the µ-maps obtained with FDG-PET had higher µ-values than those obtained with FMM-PET in the parietal regions of the head and skull, in a portion of the cerebellar dentate nucleus and on the surface of the frontal lobe. The comparison between FDG and FDG × FMM values in different regions yielded findings similar to those of the µ-maps comparison. FDG × FMM values were significantly higher than FDG values in the bilateral temporal bones and a small part of the temporal lobe. Similarly, FMM values were significantly higher than FMM × FDG values in the bilateral temporal bones. FMM × FDG values were significantly higher than FMM values in a small area of the right cerebellar hemisphere. However, the relative errors in these µ-maps were within ± 4%, suggesting that they are clinically insignificant. In PET images reconstructed with the original and swapped µ-maps, the relative errors were within ± 7% and the quality was nearly equivalent.

Conclusion: These findings suggest the clinical reliability of the AC method without an external radiation source in TOF brain-dedicated PET systems.

TITLE: [Pulmonary PET /CT image instance segmentation based on dense interactive feature fusion Mask RCNN]

JOURNAL: Sheng wu yi xue gong cheng xue za zhi = Journal of biomedical engineering = Shengwu yixue gongchengxue zazhi

ABSTRACT:
There are some problems in positron emission tomography/ computed tomography (PET/CT) lung images, such as little information of feature pixels in lesion regions, complex and diverse shapes, and blurred boundaries between lesions and surrounding tissues, which lead to inadequate extraction of tumor lesion features by the model. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes a dense interactive feature fusion Mask RCNN (DIF-Mask RCNN) model. Firstly, a feature extraction network with cross-scale backbone and auxiliary structures was designed to extract the features of lesions at different scales. Then, a dense interactive feature enhancement network was designed to enhance the lesion detail information in the deep feature map by interactively fusing the shallowest lesion features with neighboring features and current features in the form of dense connections. Finally, a dense interactive feature fusion feature pyramid network (FPN) network was constructed, and the shallow information was added to the deep features one by one in the bottom-up path with dense connections to further enhance the model's perception of weak features in the lesion region. The ablation and comparison experiments were conducted on the clinical PET/CT lung image dataset. The results showed that the APdet, APseg, APdet_s and APseg_s indexes of the proposed model were 67.16%, 68.12%, 34.97% and 37.68%, respectively. Compared with Mask RCNN (ResNet50), APdet and APseg indexes increased by 7.11% and 5.14%, respectively. DIF-Mask RCNN model can effectively detect and segment tumor lesions. It provides important reference value and evaluation basis for computer-aided diagnosis of lung cancer.

TITLE: Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma segmentation in PET-CT images via hybrid learning for feature fusion

AUTHORS: Cheng Yuan, Miao Zhang, Xinyun Huang, Wei Xie, Xiaozhu Lin, Weili Zhao, Biao Li, Dahong Qian

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is an aggressive type of lymphoma with high mortality and poor prognosis that especially has a high incidence in Asia. Accurate segmentation of DLBCL lesions is crucial for clinical radiation therapy. However, manual delineation of DLBCL lesions is tedious and time-consuming. Automatic segmentation provides an alternative solution but is difficult for diffuse lesions without the sufficient utilization of multimodality information. Our work is the first study focusing on positron emission tomography and computed tomography (PET-CT) feature fusion for the DLBCL segmentation issue. We aim to improve the fusion performance of complementary information contained in PET-CT imaging with a hybrid learning module in the supervised convolutional neural network.

Methods: First, two encoder branches extract single-modality features, respectively. Next, the hybrid learning component utilizes them to generate spatial fusion maps which can quantify the contribution of complementary information. Such feature fusion maps are then concatenated with specific-modality (i.e., PET and CT) feature maps to obtain a representation of the final fused feature maps in different scales. Finally, the reconstruction part of our network creates a prediction map of DLBCL lesions by integrating and up-sampling the final fused feature maps from encoder blocks in different scales.

Results: The ability of our method was evaluated to detect foreground and segment lesions in three independent body regions (nasopharynx, chest, and abdomen) of a set of 45 PET-CT scans. Extensive ablation experiments compared our method to four baseline techniques for multimodality fusion (input-level (IL) fusion, multichannel (MC) strategy, multibranch (MB) strategy, and quantitative weighting (QW) fusion). The results showed that our method achieved a high detection accuracy (99.63% in the nasopharynx, 99.51% in the chest, and 99.21% in the abdomen) and had the superiority in segmentation performance with the mean dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 73.03% and the modified Hausdorff distance (MHD) of 4.39 mm, when compared with the baselines (DSC: IL: 53.08%, MC: 63.59%, MB: 69.98%, and QW: 72.19%; MHD: IL: 12.16 mm, MC: 6.46 mm, MB: 4.83 mm, and QW: 4.89 mm).

Conclusions: A promising segmentation method has been proposed for the challenging DLBCL lesions in PET-CT images, which improves the understanding of complementary information by feature fusion and may guide clinical radiotherapy. The statistically significant analysis based on P-value calculation has indicated a degree of significant difference between our proposed method and other baselines (almost metrics: P < 0.05). This is a preliminary research using a small sample size, and we will collect data continually to achieve the larger verification study.

TITLE: Deep learning generation of preclinical positron emission tomography (PET) images from low-count PET with task-based performance assessment

AUTHORS: Kaushik Dutta, Richard Laforest, Jingqin Luo, Abhinav K Jha, Kooresh I Shoghi

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Background: Preclinical low-count positron emission tomography (LC-PET) imaging offers numerous advantages such as facilitating imaging logistics, enabling longitudinal studies of long- and short-lived isotopes as well as increasing scanner throughput. However, LC-PET is characterized by reduced photon-count levels resulting in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), segmentation difficulties, and quantification uncertainties.

Purpose: We developed and evaluated a novel deep-learning (DL) architecture-Attention based Residual-Dilated Net (ARD-Net)-to generate standard-count PET (SC-PET) images from LC-PET images. The performance of the ARD-Net framework was evaluated for numerous low count realizations using fidelity-based qualitative metrics, task-based segmentation, and quantitative metrics.

Method: Patient Derived tumor Xenograft (PDX) with tumors implanted in the mammary fat-pad were subjected to preclinical [18F]-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET/CT imaging. SC-PET images were derived from a 10 min static FDG-PET acquisition, 50 min post administration of FDG, and were resampled to generate four distinct LC-PET realizations corresponding to 10%, 5%, 1.6%, and 0.8% of SC-PET count-level. ARD-Net was trained and optimized using 48 preclinical FDG-PET datasets, while 16 datasets were utilized to assess performance. Further, the performance of ARD-Net was benchmarked against two leading DL-based methods (Residual UNet, RU-Net; and Dilated Network, D-Net) and non-DL methods (Non-Local Means, NLM; and Block Matching 3D Filtering, BM3D). The performance of the framework was evaluated using traditional fidelity-based image quality metrics such as Structural Similarity Index Metric (SSIM) and Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE), as well as human observer-based tumor segmentation performance (Dice Score and volume bias) and quantitative analysis of Standardized Uptake Value (SUV) measurements. Additionally, radiomics-derived features were utilized as a measure of quality assurance (QA) in comparison to true SC-PET. Finally, a performance ensemble score (EPS) was developed by integrating fidelity-based and task-based metrics. Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) was utilized to determine concordance between measures. The non-parametric Friedman Test with Bonferroni correction was used to compare the performance of ARD-Net against benchmarked methods with significance at adjusted p-value ≤0.01.

Results: ARD-Net-generated SC-PET images exhibited significantly better (p ≤ 0.01 post Bonferroni correction) overall image fidelity scores in terms of SSIM and NRMSE at majority of photon-count levels compared to benchmarked DL and non-DL methods. In terms of task-based quantitative accuracy evaluated by SUVMeanand SUVPeak,ARD-Net exhibited less than 5% median absolute bias for SUVMeancompared to true SC-PET and lower degree of variability compared to benchmarked DL and non-DL based methods in generating SC-PET. Additionally, ARD-Net-generated SC-PET images displayed higher degree of concordance to SC-PET images in terms of radiomics features compared to non-DL and other DL approaches. Finally, the ensemble score suggested that ARD-Net exhibited significantly superior performance compared to benchmarked algorithms (p ≤ 0.01 post Bonferroni correction).

Conclusion: ARD-Net provides a robust framework to generate SC-PET from LC-PET images. ARD-Net generated SC-PET images exhibited superior performance compared other DL and non-DL approaches in terms of image-fidelity based metrics, task-based segmentation metrics, and minimal bias in terms of task-based quantification performance for preclinical PET imaging.

ABSTRACT:
The generation of Synthetic Computed Tomography (sCT) images has become a pivotal methodology in modern clinical practice, particularly in the context of Radiotherapy (RT) treatment planning. The use of sCT enables the calculation of doses, pushing towards Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) guided radiotherapy treatments. Moreover, with the introduction of MRI-Positron Emission Tomography (PET) hybrid scanners, the derivation of sCT from MRI can improve the attenuation correction of PET images. Deep learning methods for MRI-to-sCT have shown promising results, but their reliance on single-centre training dataset limits generalisation capabilities to diverse clinical settings. Moreover, creating centralised multi-centre datasets may pose privacy concerns. To address the aforementioned issues, we introduced FedSynthCT-Brain, an approach based on the Federated Learning (FL) paradigm for MRI-to-sCT in brain imaging. This is among the first applications of FL for MRI-to-sCT, employing a cross-silo horizontal FL approach that allows multiple centres to collaboratively train a U-Net-based deep learning model. We validated our method using real multicentre data from four European and American centres, simulating heterogeneous scanner types and acquisition modalities, and tested its performance on an independent dataset from a centre outside the federation. In the case of the unseen centre, the federated model achieved a median Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 102.0 HU across 23 patients, with an interquartile range of 96.7-110.5 HU. The median (interquartile range) for the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) and the Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PNSR) were 0.89 (0.86-0.89) and 26.58 (25.52-27.42), respectively. The analysis of the results showed acceptable performances of the federated approach, thus highlighting the potential of FL to enhance MRI-to-sCT to improve generalisability and advancing safe and equitable clinical applications while fostering collaboration and preserving data privacy.

JOURNAL: Electromagnetic biology and medicine

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Brain tumors present a formidable diagnostic challenge due to their aberrant cell growth. Accurate determination of tumor location and size is paramount for effective diagnosis. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) are pivotal tools in clinical diagnosis, yet tumor segmentation within their images remains challenging, particularly at boundary pixels, owing to limited sensitivity. Recent endeavors have introduced fusion-based strategies to refine segmentation accuracy, yet these methods often prove inadequate. In response, we introduce the Parallel-Way framework to surmount these obstacles. Our approach integrates MRI and PET data for a holistic analysis. Initially, we enhance image quality by employing noise reduction, bias field correction, and adaptive thresholding, leveraging Improved Kalman Filter (IKF), Expectation Maximization (EM), and Improved Vibe Algorithm (IVib), respectively. Subsequently, we conduct multi-modality image fusion through the Dual-Tree Complex Wavelet Transform (DTWCT) to amalgamate data from both modalities. Following fusion, we extract pertinent features using the Advanced Capsule Network (ACN) and reduce feature dimensionality via Multi-objective Diverse Evolution-based selection. Tumor segmentation is then executed utilizing the Twin Vision Transformer with dual attention mechanism. Implemented our Parallel-Way framework which exhibits heightened model performance. Evaluation across multiple metrics, including accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F1-Score, and AUC, underscores its superiority over existing methodologies.

TITLE: Unified spatial normalization method of brain PET images using adaptive probabilistic brain atlas

AUTHORS: Tianhao Zhang, Binbin Nie, Hua Liu, Baoci Shan, Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: A unique advantage of the brain positron emission tomography (PET) imaging is the ability to image different biological processes with different radiotracers. However, the diversity of the brain PET image patterns also makes their spatial normalization challenging. Since structural MR images are not always available in the clinical practice, this study proposed a PET-only spatial normalization method based on adaptive probabilistic brain atlas.

Methods: The proposed method (atlas-based method) consists of two parts, an adaptive probabilistic brain atlas generation algorithm, and a probabilistic framework for registering PET image to the generated atlas. To validate this method, the results of MRI-based method and template-based method (a widely used PET-only method) were treated as the gold standard and control, respectively. A total of 286 brain PET images, including seven radiotracers (FDG, PIB, FBB, AV-45, AV-1451, AV-133, [18F]altanserin) and four groups of subjects (Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, frontotemporal dementia, and healthy control), were spatially normalized using the three methods. The results were then quantitatively compared by using correlation analysis, meta region of interest (meta-ROI) standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) analysis, and statistical parametric mapping (SPM) analysis.

Results: The Pearson correlation coefficient between the images computed by atlas-based method and the gold standard was 0.908 ± 0.005. The relative error of meta-ROI SUVR computed by atlas-based method was 2.12 ± 0.18%. Compared with template-based method, atlas-based method was also more consistent with the gold standard in SPM analysis.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides a unified approach to spatially normalize brain PET images of different radiotracers accurately without MR images. A free MATLAB toolbox for this method has been provided.

TITLE: Evaluation of improved CT-based hardware attenuation correction in PET/MRI: Application to a 16-channel RF breast coil

AUTHORS: Maike E Lindemann, Mark Oehmigen, Titus Lanz, Hong Grafe, Nils Martin Bruckmann, Lale Umutlu, Harald H Quick

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: The aim of this study was to compare and evaluate three different bilinear conversion curves for attenuation correction (AC) of a 16-channel radiofrequency (RF) coil in positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance (PET/MR) breast cancer imaging.

Methods: The quantitative impact of three different bilinear conversions of computed tomography (CT) data for the AC of a 16-channel RF breast coil was systematically evaluated in phantom measurements and on n = 20 PET/MR patients with breast cancer. PET data were reconstructed four times: (1) no coil AC (C-NAC) serving as a reference, (2) established bilinear conversion by Carney et al., (3) bilinear conversion by Paulus et al., and (4) bilinear conversion by Oehmigen et al. Relative differences in PET data were calculated.

Results: Independent of the choice of bilinear conversion, significant gains in PET signal, compared to C-NAC, were measurable in all phantom and patient measurements. Mean relative differences of ca. 10% in SUVmean (i.e., standardized uptake value; maximal relative differences up to 30%) due to the integration of the coil AC were calculated, compared to C-NAC in phantom and patient measurements. Relative difference images depict that the quantitative impact of coil AC is highest in regions close to the RF coil when compared to no AC data. Bilinear conversion by Carney et al. shows a slightly overcorrection (2.9%), whereas the conversion by Paulus et al. provides a slight undercorrection of the PET images (-1.6%) in comparison to the no-coil measurement. The bilinear conversion proposed by Oehmigen et al. provides the most appropriate AC for the breast coil in this phantom experiment (-0.2%). A total of 23 congruent lesions could be detected in all patients. All lesions could be detected in all reconstructions.

Conclusions: For the best possible PET image quality and accurate PET quantification in breast PET/MRI, the AC of MR hardware components is important. The bilinear conversion proposed by Oehmigen et al. provides the most appropriate AC for the breast coil in this study.

JOURNAL: Biomedical physics & engineering express

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into lung cancer management offers immense potential to revolutionize diagnostic and treatment strategies. The aim is to develop a resilient AI framework capable of two critical tasks: firstly, achieving accurate and automated segmentation of lung tumors and secondly, facilitating the T classification of lung cancer according to the ninth edition of TNM staging 2024 based on PET/CT imaging. This study presents a robust AI framework for the automated segmentation of lung tumors and T classification of lung cancer using PET/CT imaging. The database includes axial DICOM CT and18FDG-PET/CT images. A modified ResNet-50 model was employed for segmentation, achieving high precision and specificity. Reconstructed 3D models of segmented slices enhance tumor boundary visualization, which is essential for treatment planning. The Pulmonary Toolkit facilitated lobe segmentation, providing critical diagnostic insights. Additionally, the segmented images were used as input for the T classification using a CNN ResNet-50 model. Our classification model demonstrated excellent performance, particularly for T1a, T2a, T2b, T3 and T4 tumors, with high precision, F1 scores, and specificity. The T stage is particularly relevant in lung cancer as it determines treatment approaches (surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy or supportive care) and prognosis assessment. In fact, for Tis-T2, each increase of one centimeter in tumor size results in a worse prognosis. For locally advanced tumors (T3-T4) and regardless of size, the prognosis is poorer. This AI framework marks a significant advancement in the automation of lung cancer diagnosis and staging, promising improved patient outcomes.

We examined if CT-based coregistration could improve estimates of brain dimensions and consequently estimates of nondisplaceable binding potential (BPND) in rodent PET studies.

Procedures: PET and CT scans were acquired on 5 female and 5 male CD-1 mice with 3-[18F]fluoro-5-(2-pyridinylethynyl)benzonitrile ([18F]FPEB), a radiotracer for the metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5 (mGluR5). In the proposed PET/CT (PTCT) approach, the tracer-specific standard volume was dimension-customized to each animal using the scaling factors from CT-to-standard CT coregistration to simplify PET-to-standard PET coregistration (i.e., 3 CT- and 6 PET-derived parameters). For comparison, conventional PET-based coregistration was performed with 9 (PT9) or 12 (PT12) parameters. PET frames were transferred to the standard space by the three approaches (PTCT, PT9, and PT12) to obtain regional time-activity curves (TACs) and BPNDin 14 standard volumes of interest (VOIs). Lastly, CT images of the animals were transferred to the standard space by CT-based parameters from PTCT and with the scaling factors replaced with those from PET-based PT9 to evaluate agreement of the skull to the standard CT.

Results: The PET-based approaches showed various degrees of underestimations of scaling factors in the posterior-anterior-direction compared to PTCT, which resulted in negatively proportional overestimation of radioactivity in the cerebellum (reference region) up to 20%, and proportional, more prominent underestimation of BPNDin target regions down to -50%. The skulls of individual animals agreed with the standard skull for scaling factors from PTCT but not for the scaling factors from PT9, which suggested inaccuracy of the latter.

Conclusions: The results indicated that conventional PET-based coregistration approaches could yield biased estimates of BPNDin proportion to errors of brain dimensions when applied to tracers for which the cerebellum serves as reference region. The proposed PTCT provides evidence of a quantitative improvement over PET-based approaches for brain studies using micro-PET/CT scanners.

ABSTRACT:
Brain PET imaging often faces challenges from head motion (HM), which can introduce artifacts and reduce image resolution, crucial in clinical settings for accurate treatment planning, diagnosis, and monitoring. United Imaging Healthcare has developed NeuroFocus, an HM correction (HMC) algorithm for the uMI Panorama PET/CT system, using a data-driven, statistics-based approach. The HMC algorithm automatically detects HM using a centroid-of-distribution technique, requiring no parameter adjustments. This study aimed to validate NeuroFocus and assess the prevalence of HM in clinical short-duration18F-FDG scans.Methods:The study involved 317 patients undergoing brain PET scans, divided into 2 groups: 15 for HMC validation and 302 for evaluation. Validation involved patients undergoing 2 consecutive 3-min single-bed-position brain18F-FDG scans-one with instructions to remain still and another with instructions to move substantially. The evaluation examined 302 clinical single-bed-position brain scans for patients with various neurologic diagnoses. Motion was categorized as small or large on the basis of a 5% SUV change in the frontal lobe after HMC. Percentage differences in SUVmeanwere reported across 11 brain regions.Results:The validation group displayed a large negative difference (-10.1%), with variation of 5.2% between no-HM and HM scans. After HMC, this difference decreased dramatically (-0.8%), with less variation (3.2%), indicating effective HMC application. In the evaluation group, 38 of 302 patients experienced large HM, showing a 10.9% ± 8.9% SUV increase after HMC, whereas most exhibited minimal uptake changes (0.1% ± 1.3%). The HMC algorithm not only enhanced the image resolution and contrast but also aided in disease identification and reduced the need for repeat scans, potentially optimizing clinical workflows.Conclusion:The study confirmed the effectiveness of NeuroFocus in managing HM in short clinical18F-FDG studies on the uMI Panorama PET/CT system. It found that approximately 12% of scans required HMC, establishing HMC as a reliable tool for clinical brain18F-FDG studies.

TITLE: Feasibility of identifying proliferative active bone marrow with fat fraction MRI and multi-energy CT

AUTHORS: M Lawless, K Byrns, B P Bednarz, J Meudt, D Shanmuganayagam, J Shah, A McMillan, K Li, A Pirasteh, J Miller

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Objective.Active bone marrow (ABM) can serve as both an organ at risk and a target in external beam radiotherapy.18F-fluorothymidine (FLT) PET is the current gold standard for identifying proliferative ABM but it is not approved for human use, and PET scanners are not always available to radiotherapy clinics. Identifying ABM through other, more accessible imaging modalities will allow more patients to receive treatment specific to their ABM distribution. Multi-energy CT (MECT) and fat-fraction MRI (FFMRI) show promise in their ability to characterize bone marrow adiposity, but these methods require validation for identifying proliferative ABM.Approach.Six swine subjects were imaged using FFMRI, fast-kVp switching (FKS) MECT and sequential-scanning (SS) MECT to identify ABM volumes relative to FLT PET-derived ABM volumes. ABM was contoured on FLT PET images as the region within the bone marrow with a SUV above the mean. Bone marrow was then contoured on the FFMRI and MECT images, and thresholds were applied within these contours to determine which threshold produced the best agreement with the FLT PET determined ABM contour. Agreement between contours was measured using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC).Main results.FFMRI produced the best estimate of the PET ABM contour. Compared to FLT PET ABM volumes, the FFMRI, SS MECT and FKS MECT ABM contours produced average peak DSC of 0.722 ± 0.080, 0.619 ± 0.070, and 0.464 ± 0.080, respectively. The ABM volume was overestimated by 40.51%, 97.63%, and 140.13% by FFMRI, SS MECT and FKS MECT, respectively.Significance.This study explored the ability of FFMRI and MECT to identify the proliferative relative to ABM defined by FLT PET. Of the methods investigated, FFMRI emerged as the most accurate approximation to FLT PET-derived active marrow contour, demonstrating superior performance by both DSC and volume comparison metrics. Both FFMRI and SS MECT show promise for providing patient-specific ABM treatments.

TITLE: Total-Body Parametric Imaging Using Relative Patlak Plot

AUTHORS: Siqi Li, Yasser G Abdelhafez, Lorenzo Nardo, Simon R Cherry, Ramsey D Badawi, Guobao Wang

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
The standard Patlak plot, a simple yet efficient model, is widely used to describe irreversible tracer kinetics for dynamic PET imaging. Its widespread application to whole-body parametric imaging remains constrained because of the need for a full-time-course input function (e.g., 1 h). In this paper, we demonstrate the relative Patlak (RP) plot, which eliminates the need for the early-time input function, for total-body parametric imaging and its application to 20-min clinical scans acquired in list mode.Methods:We conducted a theoretic analysis to indicate that the RP interceptb' is equivalent to a ratio of the SUV relative to the plasma concentration, whereas the RP slope' is equal to the standard Patlak(net influx rate) multiplied by a global scaling factor for each subject. One challenge in applying RP to a short scan duration (e.g., 20 min) is the resulting high noise in the parametric images. We applied a self-supervised deep-kernel method for noise reduction. Using the standard Patlak plot as the reference, the RP method was evaluated for lesion quantification, lesion-to-background contrast, and myocardial visualization in total-body parametric imaging in 22 human subjects (12 healthy subjects and 10 cancer patients) who underwent a 1-h dynamic18F-FDG scan. The RP method was also applied to the dynamic data reconstructed from a clinical standard 20-min list-mode scan either at 1 or 2 h after injection for 2 cancer patients.Results:We demonstrated that it is feasible to obtain high-quality parametric images from 20-min scans using RP parametric imaging with a self-supervised deep-kernel noise-reduction strategy. The RP slope' was highly correlated with the standard Patlakin lesions and major organs, demonstrating its quantitative potential across subjects. Compared with conventional SUVs, the' images significantly improved lesion contrast and enabled visualization of the myocardium for potential cardiac assessment. The application of the RP parametric imaging to the 2 clinical scans also showed similar benefits.Conclusion:Using total-body PET with the RP approach, it is feasible to generate parametric images using data from a 20-min clinical list-mode scan.

AUTHORS: Abolfazl Mehranian, Scott D Wollenweber, Kevin M Bradley, Patrick A Fielding, Martin Huellner, Andrei Iagaru, Meghi Dedja, Theodore Colwell, Fotis Kotasidis, Robert Johnsen, Floris P Jansen, Daniel R McGowan

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Aim: To evaluate a deep learning-based time-of-flight (DLToF) model trained to enhance the image quality of non-ToF PET images for different tracers, reconstructed using BSREM algorithm, towards ToF images.

Methods: A 3D residual U-NET model was trained using 8 different tracers (FDG: 75% and non-FDG: 25%) from 11 sites from US, Europe and Asia. A total of 309 training and 33 validation datasets scanned on GE Discovery MI (DMI) ToF scanners were used for development of DLToF models of three strengths: low (L), medium (M) and high (H). The training and validation pairs consisted of target ToF and input non-ToF BSREM reconstructions using site-preferred regularisation parameters (beta values). The contrast and noise properties of each model were defined by adjusting the beta value of target ToF images. A total of 60 DMI datasets, consisting of a set of 4 tracers (18F-FDG,18F-PSMA,68Ga-PSMA,68Ga-DOTATATE) and 15 exams each, were collected for testing and quantitative analysis of the models based on standardized uptake value (SUV) in regions of interest (ROI) placed in lesions, lungs and liver. Each dataset includes 5 image series: ToF and non-ToF BSREM and three DLToF images. The image series (300 in total) were blind scored on a 5-point Likert score by 4 readers based on lesion detectability, diagnostic confidence, and image noise/quality.

Results: In lesion SUVmaxquantification with respect to ToF BSREM, DLToF-H achieved the best results among the three models by reducing the non-ToF BSREM errors from -39% to -6% for18F-FDG (38 lesions); from -42% to -7% for18F-PSMA (35 lesions); from -34% to -4% for68Ga-PSMA (23 lesions) and from -34% to -12% for68Ga-DOTATATE (32 lesions). Quantification results in liver and lung also showed ToF-like performance of DLToF models. Clinical reader resulted showed that DLToF-H results in an improved lesion detectability on average for all four radiotracers whereas DLToF-L achieved the highest scores for image quality (noise level). The results of DLToF-M however showed that this model results in the best trade-off between lesion detection and noise level and hence achieved the highest score for diagnostic confidence on average for all radiotracers.

Conclusion: This study demonstrated that the DLToF models are suitable for both FDG and non-FDG tracers and could be utilized for digital BGO PET/CT scanners to provide an image quality and lesion detectability comparable and close to ToF.

TITLE: Radiomics and Artificial Intelligence Landscape for [18F]FDG PET/CT in Multiple Myeloma

AUTHORS: Christos Sachpekidis, Hartmut Goldschmidt, Lars Edenbrandt, Antonia Dimitrakopoulou-Strauss

JOURNAL: Seminars in nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
[18F]FDG PET/CT is a powerful imaging modality of high performance in multiple myeloma (MM) and is considered the appropriate method for assessing treatment response in this disease. On the other hand, due to the heterogeneous and sometimes complex patterns of bone marrow infiltration in MM, the interpretation of PET/CT can be particularly challenging, hampering interobserver reproducibility and limiting the diagnostic and prognostic ability of the modality. Although many approaches have been developed to address the issue of standardization, none can yet be considered a standard method for interpretation or objective quantification of PET/CT. Therefore, advanced diagnostic quantification approaches are needed to support and potentially guide the management of MM. In recent years, radiomics has emerged as an innovative method for high-throughput mining of image-derived features for clinical decision making, which may be particularly helpful in oncology. In addition, machine learning and deep learning, both subfields of artificial intelligence (AI) closely related to the radiomics process, have been increasingly applied to automated image analysis, offering new possibilities for a standardized evaluation of imaging modalities such as CT, PET/CT and MRI in oncology. In line with this, the initial but steadily growing literature on the application of radiomics and AI-based methods in the field of [18F]FDG PET/CT in MM has already yielded encouraging results, offering a potentially reliable tool towards optimization and standardization of interpretation in this disease. The main results of these studies are presented in this review.

AUTHORS: Charles Mesguich, Elif Hindie, Baudouin Denis de Senneville, Ghoufrane Tlili, Jean-Baptiste Pinaquy, Gerald Marit, Olivier Saut

JOURNAL: Nuclear medicine communications

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Objectives: In multiple myeloma, the diagnosis of diffuse bone marrow infiltration on 18-FDG PET/CT can be challenging. We aimed to develop a PET/CT radiomics-based model that could improve the diagnosis of multiple myeloma diffuse disease on 18-FDG PET/CT.

Methods: We prospectively performed PET/CT and whole-body diffusion-weighted MRI in 30 newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. MRI was the reference standard for diffuse disease assessment. Twenty patients were randomly assigned to a training set and 10 to an independent test set. Visual analysis of PET/CT was performed by two nuclear medicine physicians. Spine volumes were automatically segmented, and a total of 174 Imaging Biomarker Standardisation Initiative-compliant radiomics features were extracted from PET and CT. Selection of best features was performed with random forest features importance and correlation analysis. Machine-learning algorithms were trained on the selected features with cross-validation and evaluated on the independent test set.

Results: Out of the 30 patients, 18 had established diffuse disease on MRI. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of visual analysis were 67, 75 and 70%, respectively, with a moderate kappa coefficient of agreement of 0.6. Five radiomics features were selected. On the training set, random forest classifier reached a sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 93, 86 and 91%, respectively, with an area under the curve of 0.90 (95% confidence interval, 0.89-0.91). On the independent test set, the model achieved an accuracy of 80%.

Conclusions: Radiomics analysis of 18-FDG PET/CT images with machine-learning overcame the limitations of visual analysis, providing a highly accurate and more reliable diagnosis of diffuse bone marrow infiltration in multiple myeloma patients.

ABSTRACT:
Objective.Respiratory motion correction is beneficial in positron emission tomography (PET), as it can reduce artefacts caused by motion and improve quantitative accuracy. Methods of motion correction are commonly based on a respiratory trace obtained through an external device (like the real time position management system) or a data driven method, such as those based on dimensionality reduction techniques (for instance principal component analysis (PCA)). PCA itself being a linear transformation to the axis of greatest variation. Data driven methods have the advantage of being non-invasive, and can be performed post-acquisition. However, their main downside being that they are adversely affected by the tracer kinetics of the dynamic PET acquisition. Therefore, they are mostly limited to static PET acquisitions. This work seeks to extend on existing PCA-based data-driven motion correction methods, to allow for their applicability to dynamic PET imaging.Approach.The methods explored in this work include; a moving window approach (similar to the Kinetic Respiratory Gating method from Schleyeret al(2014)), extrapolation of the principal component from later time points to earlier time points, and a method to score, select, and combine multiple respiratory components. The resulting respiratory traces were evaluated on 22 data sets from a dynamic [18F]-FDG study on patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. This was achieved by calculating their correlation with a surrogate signal acquired using a real time position management system.Main results.The results indicate that all methods produce better surrogate signals than when applying conventional PCA to dynamic data (for instance, a higher correlation with a gold standard respiratory trace). Extrapolating a late time point principal component produced more promising results than using a moving window. Scoring, selecting, and combining components held benefits over all other methods.Significance.This work allows for the extraction of a surrogate signal from dynamic PET data earlier in the acquisition and with a greater accuracy than previous work. This potentially allows for numerous other methods (for instance, respiratory motion correction) to be applied to this data (when they otherwise could not be previously used).

TITLE: Design and implementation of continuous bed motion (CBM) in Xtrim preclinical PET scanner for whole-body Imaging: MC simulation and experimental measurements

AUTHORS: Bahador Bahadorzadeh, Reza Faghihi, Sedigheh Sina, Ahdiyeh Aghaz, Arman Rahmim, Mohammad Reza Ay

JOURNAL: Physica medica : PM : an international journal devoted to the applications of physics to medicine and biology : official journal of the Italian Association of Biomedical Physics (AIFB)

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Preclinical PET scanners often have limited axial field-of-view for whole-body (WB) scanning of the small-animal. Step-and-shoot(S&S) acquisition mode requires multiple bed positions (BPs) to cover the scan length. Alternatively, in Continuous Bed Motion(CBM) mode, data acquisition is performed while the bed is continuously moving. In this study, to reduce acquisition time and enhance image quality, the CBM acquisition protocol was optimized and implemented on the Xtrim-PET preclinical scanner for WB imaging.

Methods: The over-scan percentage(OS%) in CBM mode was optimized by Monte Carlo simulation. Bed movement speed was optimized considering ranges from 0.1 to 2.0 mm s-1, and absolute system sensitivities with the optimal OS% were calculated. The performance of the scanner in CBM mode was measured, and compared with S&S mode based on the NEMA-NU4 standard.

Results: The optimal trade-off between absolute sensitivity and uniformity of sensitivity profile was achieved at OS-50 %. In comparison to S&S mode with maximum ring differences (MRD) of 9 and 23, the calculated equivalent speeds in CBM(OS-50 %) mode were 0.3 and 0.14 mm s-1, respectively. In terms of data acquisition with equal sensitivity in both CBM(OS-50 %) and S&S(MRD-9) modes, the total scan time in CBM mode decreased by 25.9 %, 47.7 %, 54.7 %, and 58.2 % for scan lengths of 1 to 4 BPs, respectively.

Conclusion: The CBM mode enhances WB PET scans for small-animals, offering rapid data acquisition, high system sensitivity, and uniform axial sensitivity, leading to improved image quality. Its efficiency and customizable scan length and bed speed make it a superior alternative.

TITLE: Radiological characterization of gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata) by X-ray computed tomography

AUTHORS: Diana Ceballos-Francisco, Nuria G Carrillo, Francisco J Pardo-Fernández, Alberto Cuesta, María Á Esteban

JOURNAL: Journal of fish biology

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
In recent years, the increasing use of fish as new animal models in scientific research and the growth of fish farming (mainly for human consumption) have highlighted the need for advanced technology to deepen our knowledge of fish biology. Hence, the present study was carried out to radiologically analyse the whole body of gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata) specimens using X-ray computed tomography (CT). Images were acquired in an Albira SPECT/PET/CT tri-modal preclinical-scanner. Segmentation, measurements and three-dimensional reconstruction were made using the Carestream Molecular imaging Albira CT system in conjunction with Pmod, AMIDE and Amira software packages. The results showed that the density values of gilthead seabream are in the range -700 to +2500 HU for the whole body. We also determined the density ranges that topographically coincide with the swim bladder, soft tissues, fat, skin and skeleton. This work describes, validates and demonstrates the application of a fully automated image analysis technique to study and quantify fish body composition, whether segmented or as a whole. In addition, the basis for applying this image technique in other in vivo studies is established.

TITLE: Advanced finite segmentation model with hybrid classifier learning for high-precision brain tumor delineation in PET imaging

AUTHORS: K Murugan, SatheeshKumar Palanisamy, N Sathishkumar, Tagrid Abdullah N Alshalali

JOURNAL: Scientific reports

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Brain tumor segmentation plays a crucial role in clinical diagnostics and treatment planning, yet accurate and efficient segmentation remains a significant challenge due to complex tumor structures and variations in imaging modalities. Multi-feature selection and region classification depend on continuous homogeneous features to improve the precision of tumor detection. This classification is required to suppress the discreteness across various extraction rates to consent to the smallest segmentation region that is infected. This study proposes a Finite Segmentation Model (FSM) with Improved Classifier Learning (ICL) to enhance segmentation accuracy in Positron Emission Tomography (PET) images. The FSM-ICL framework integrates advanced textural feature extraction, deep learning-based classification, and an adaptive segmentation approach to differentiate between tumor and non-tumor regions with high precision. Our model is trained and validated on the Synthetic Whole-Head Brain Tumor Segmentation Dataset, consisting of 1000 training and 426 testing images, achieving a segmentation accuracy of 92.57%, significantly outperforming existing approaches such as NRAN (62.16%), DSSE-V-Net (71.47%), and DenseUNet+ (83.93%). Furthermore, FSM-ICL enhances classification precision to 95.59%, reduces classification error to 5.67%, and minimizes classification time to 572.39 ms, demonstrating a 10.09% improvement in precision and a 10.96% boost in classification rates over state-of-the-art methods. The hybrid classifier learning approach effectively addresses segmentation discreteness, ensuring continuous and discrete tumor region detection with superior feature differentiation. This work has significant implications for automated tumor detection, personalized treatment strategies, and AI-driven medical imaging advancements. Future directions include incorporating micro-segmentation and pre-classification techniques to further optimize performance in dense pixel-packed datasets.

TITLE: AATSN: Anatomy Aware Tumor Segmentation Network for PET-CT volumes and images using a lightweight fusion-attention mechanism

AUTHORS: Ibtihaj Ahmad, Yong Xia, Hengfei Cui, Zain Ul Islam

JOURNAL: Computers in biology and medicine

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography (FDG-PET) provides metabolic information, while Computed Tomography (CT) provides the anatomical context of the tumors. Combined PET-CT segmentation helps in computer-assisted tumor diagnosis, staging, and treatment planning. Current state-of-the-art models mainly rely on early or late fusion techniques. These methods, however, rarely learn PET-CT complementary features and cannot efficiently co-relate anatomical and metabolic features. These drawbacks can be removed by intermediate fusion; however, it produces inaccurate segmentations in the case of heterogeneous textures in the modalities. Furthermore, it requires massive computation. In this work, we propose AATSN (Anatomy Aware Tumor Segmentation Network), which extracts anatomical CT features, and then intermediately fuses with PET features through a fusion-attention mechanism. Our anatomy-aware fusion-attention mechanism fuses the selective useful CT and PET features instead of fusing the full features set. Thus this not only improves the network performance but also requires lesser resources. Furthermore, our model is scalable to 2D images and 3D volumes. The proposed model is rigorously trained, tested, evaluated, and compared to the state-of-the-art through several ablation studies on the largest available datasets. We have achieved a 0.8104 dice score and 2.11 median HD95 score in a 3D setup, while 0.6756 dice score in a 2D setup. We demonstrate that AATSN achieves a significant performance gain while being lightweight at the same time compared to the state-of-the-art methods. The implications of AATSN include improved tumor delineation for diagnosis, analysis, and radiotherapy treatment.

TITLE: Deep learning-based automated segmentation of eight brain anatomical regions using head CT images in PET/CT

AUTHORS: Tong Wang, Haiqun Xing, Yige Li, Sicong Wang, Ling Liu, Fang Li, Hongli Jing

JOURNAL: BMC medical imaging

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Objective: We aim to propose a deep learning-based method of automated segmentation of eight brain anatomical regions in head computed tomography (CT) images obtained during positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scans. The brain regions include basal ganglia, cerebellum, hemisphere, and hippocampus, all split into left and right.

Materials and methods: We enrolled patients who underwent both PET/CT imaging (with an extra head CT scan) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The segmentation of eight brain regions in CT was achieved by using convolutional neural networks (CNNs): DenseVNet and 3D U-Net. The same segmentation task in MRI was performed by using BrainSuite13, which was a public atlas label method. The mean Dice scores were used to assess the performance of the CNNs. Then, the agreement and correlation of the volumes of the eight segmented brain regions between CT and MRI methods were analyzed.

Results: 18 patients were enrolled. Four of the eight brain regions obtained high mean Dice scores (> 0.90): left (0.978) and right (0.912) basal ganglia and left (0.945) and right (0.960) hemisphere. Regarding the agreement and correlation of the brain region volumes between two methods, moderate agreements were observed on the left (ICC: 0.618, 95% CI 0.242, 0.835) and right (ICC: 0.654, 95% CI 0.298, 0.853) hemisphere. Poor agreements were observed on the other regions. A moderate correlation was observed on the right hemisphere (Spearman's rho 0.68, p = 0.0019). Lower correlations were observed on the other regions.

Conclusions: The proposed deep learning-based method performed automated segmentation of eight brain anatomical regions on head CT imaging in PET/CT. Some regions obtained high mean Dice scores and the agreement and correlation results of the segmented region volumes between two methods were moderate to poor.

TITLE: The impact of MR-based attenuation correction in spinal cord FDG-PET/MR imaging for neurological studies

AUTHORS: Valentina Brancato, Pasquale Borrelli, Vincenzo Alfano, Marco Picardi, Mario Mascalchi, Emanuele Nicolai, Marco Salvatore, Marco Aiello

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Positron emission tomography (PET) attenuation correction (AC) in positron emission tomography-magnetic resonance (PET/MR) scanners constitutes a critical and barely explored issue in spinal cord investigation, mainly due to the limitations in accounting for highly attenuating bone structures which surround the spinal canal. Our study aims at evaluating the clinical suitability of MR-driven AC (MRAC) for 18-fluorodeoxy-glucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG-PET) in spinal cord.

Methods: Thirty-six patients, undergoing positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET/CT) and PET/MR in the same session for oncological examination, were retrospectively analyzed. For each patient, raw PET data from PET/MR scanner were reconstructed with 4- and 5-class MRAC maps, generated by hybrid PET/MR system (PET_MRAC4 and PET_MRAC5, respectively, where PET_MRAC is PET images reconstructed using MR-based attenuation correction map), and an AC map derived from CT data after a custom co-registration pipeline (PET_rCTAC, where PET_rCTAC is PET images reconstructed using CT-based attenuation correction map), which served as reference. Mean PET standardized uptake values () were extracted from the three reconstructed PET images by regions of interest (ROIs) identified on T2-weighted MRI, in the spinal cord, lumbar cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and vertebral marrow at five levels (C2, C5, T6, T12, and L3).values from PET_MRAC4 and PET_MRAC5 were compared with each other and with the reference by means of paired t-test, and correlated using Pearson's correlation (r) to assess their consistency. Cohen's d was calculated to assess the magnitude of differences between PET images.

Results: values from PET_MRAC4 were lower than those from PET_MRAC5 in almost all analyzed ROIs, with a mean difference ranging from 0.03 to 0.26 (statistically significant in the vertebral marrow at C2 and C5, spinal cord at T6 and T2, and CSF at L3). This was also confirmed by the effect size, with highest values at low spinal levels (d = 0.45 at T12 in spinal cord, d = 0.95 at L3 in CSF).values from PET_MRAC4 and PET_MRAC5 showed a very good correlation (0.81 < r < 0.97, p < 0.05) in all spinal ROIs. Underestimation ofbetween PET_MRAC4 and PET_rCTAC was observed at each level, with a mean difference ranging from 0.02 to 0.32 (statistically significant in the vertebral marrow at C2 and T6, and CSF at L3). Although PET_MRAC5 underestimates PET_rCTAC (mean difference ranging from 0.02 to 0.3), an overall decrease in effect size could be observed for PET_MRAC5, mainly at lower spinal levels (T12, L3).from both PET_MRAC4 and PET_MRAC5 methods showed r value from good to very good with respect to PET_rCTAC (0.67 < r < 0.9 and 0.73 < r < 0.94, p < 0.05, respectively).

Conclusions: Our results showed that neglecting bones in AC can underestimate the FDG uptake measurement of the spinal cord. The inclusion of bones in MRAC is far from negligible and improves the AC in spinal cord, mainly at low spinal levels. Therefore, care must be taken in the spinal canal region, and the use of AC map reconstruction methods accounting for bone structures could be beneficial.

TITLE: Diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease using brain [Formula: see text]-FDG PET imaging based on a state space model

AUTHORS: Yufang Dong, Yonglin Chen, Zhe Jin, Xingbo Dong

JOURNAL: Scientific reports

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
In recent studies on Alzheimer's disease (AD), various network models have shown significant potential in disease prediction. However, traditional CNNs often rely on parameterized loss functions, limiting the robustness of these models. Additionally, their high computational complexity increases resource demands. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel prediction model that integrates the strengths of ViTs and the MedMamba module. First, this study draws on the SS-Conv-SSM module from the MedMamba model, which processes image branches in parallel to extract richer and more refined features. Building on this, we optimized the original purely convolutional structure into a hybrid architecture combining convolution and Transformer layers. This not only reduces the computational burden and enhances operational efficiency but also improves the model's ability to capture global features. Moreover, we introduced a new self-attention mechanism into the model's MDTA module, reducing the computational complexity from quadratic to linear. This allows the model to maintain high performance while achieving more lightweight and efficient operations. The final experimental results demonstrate that this model outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in predicting Alzheimer's using brain [Formula: see text]-FDG PET (fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography) images, particularly excelling in distinguishing AD from mild cognitive impairment.

TITLE: Investigating Simultaneity for Deep Learning-Enhanced Actual Ultra-Low-Dose Amyloid PET/MR Imaging

AUTHORS: K T Chen, O Adeyeri, T N Toueg, M Zeineh, E Mormino, M Khalighi, G Zaharchuk

JOURNAL: AJNR. American journal of neuroradiology

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Background and purpose: Diagnostic-quality amyloid PET images can be created with deep learning using actual ultra-low-dose PET images and simultaneous structural MR imaging. Here, we investigated whether simultaneity is required; if not, MR imaging-assisted ultra-low-dose PET imaging could be performed with separate PET/CT and MR imaging acquisitions.

Materials and methods: We recruited 48 participants: Thirty-two (20 women; mean, 67.7 [SD, 7.9] years) were used for pretraining; 328 (SD, 32) MBq of [18F] florbetaben was injected. Sixteen participants (6 women; mean, 71.4 [SD. 8.7] years of age) were scanned in 2 sessions, with 6.5 (SD, 3.8) and 300 (SD, 14) MBq of [18F] florbetaben injected, respectively. Structural MR imaging was acquired simultaneously with PET (90-110 minutes postinjection) on integrated PET/MR imaging in 2 sessions. Multiple U-Net-based deep networks were trained to create diagnostic PET images. For each method, training was done with the ultra-low-dose PET as input combined with MR imaging from either the ultra-low-dose session (simultaneous) or from the standard-dose PET session (nonsimultaneous). Image quality of the enhanced and ultra-low-dose PET images was evaluated using quantitative signal-processing methods, standardized uptake value ratio correlation, and clinical reads.

Results: Qualitatively, the enhanced images resembled the standard-dose image for both simultaneous and nonsimultaneous conditions. Three quantitative metrics showed significant improvement for all networks and no differences due to simultaneity. Standardized uptake value ratio correlation was high across different image types and network training methods, and 31/32 enhanced image pairs were read similarly.

Conclusions: This work suggests that accurate amyloid PET images can be generated using enhanced ultra-low-dose PET and either nonsimultaneous or simultaneous MR imaging, broadening the utility of ultra-low-dose amyloid PET imaging.

TITLE: Transfer learning-based attenuation correction for static and dynamic cardiac PET using a generative adversarial network

AUTHORS: Hao Sun, Fanghu Wang, Yuling Yang, Xiaotong Hong, Weiping Xu, Shuxia Wang, Greta S P Mok, Lijun Lu

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: The goal of this work is to demonstrate the feasibility of directly generating attenuation-corrected PET images from non-attenuation-corrected (NAC) PET images for both rest and stress-state static or dynamic [13N]ammonia MP PET based on a generative adversarial network.

Methods: We recruited 60 subjects for rest-only scans and 14 subjects for rest-stress scans, all of whom underwent [13N]ammonia cardiac PET/CT examinations to acquire static and dynamic frames with both 3D NAC and CT-based AC (CTAC) PET images. We developed a 3D pix2pix deep learning AC (DLAC) framework via a U-net + ResNet-based generator and a convolutional neural network-based discriminator. Paired static or dynamic NAC and CTAC PET images from 60 rest-only subjects were used as network inputs and labels for static (S-DLAC) and dynamic (D-DLAC) training, respectively. The pre-trained S-DLAC network was then fine-tuned by paired dynamic NAC and CTAC PET frames of 60 rest-only subjects to derive an improved D-DLAC-FT for dynamic PET images. The 14 rest-stress subjects were used as an internal testing dataset and separately tested on different network models without training. The proposed methods were evaluated using visual quality and quantitative metrics.

Results: The proposed S-DLAC, D-DLAC, and D-DLAC-FT methods were consistent with clinical CTAC in terms of various images and quantitative metrics. The S-DLAC (slope = 0.9423, R2= 0.947) showed a higher correlation with the reference static CTAC as compared to static NAC (slope = 0.0992, R2= 0.654). D-DLAC-FT yielded lower myocardial blood flow (MBF) errors in the whole left ventricular myocardium than D-DLAC, but with no significant difference, both for the 60 rest-state subjects (6.63 ± 5.05% vs. 7.00 ± 6.84%, p = 0.7593) and the 14 stress-state subjects (1.97 ± 2.28% vs. 3.21 ± 3.89%, p = 0.8595).

Conclusion: The proposed S-DLAC, D-DLAC, and D-DLAC-FT methods achieve comparable performance with clinical CTAC. Transfer learning shows promising potential for dynamic MP PET.

TITLE: Recovery of inter-detector and inter-crystal scattering in brain PET based on LSO and GAGG crystals

AUTHORS: Seungeun Lee, Kyeong Yun Kim, Min Sun Lee, Jae Sung Lee

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Gadolinium aluminum gallium garnet (GAGG) is a promising scintillator crystal for positron emission tomography (PET) detectors owing to its advantages of energy resolution, light yield, and absence of intrinsic radiation. However, a large portion of the incident photons undergoes Compton scattering within GAGG crystal because of its low stopping power compared to that of lutetium-based crystals such as Lu2SiO5(LSO). Inter-detector scattering (IDS) and inter-crystal scattering (ICS) result in loss of sensitivity and image quality of PET, respectively. We performed a Monte Carlo simulation study to evaluate IDS recovery in our currently developing brain-dedicated PET, and extended the idea to ICS recovery. We also compared the impact of the recoveries on LSO- and GAGG-based PET scanners. We measured the sensitivity and spatial resolution of the brain PET, and analyzed the image quality using a lesion phantom, a hot-rod phantom, and a 2D Hoffman phantom with applying IDS or ICS recovery. IDS recovery increased the PET sensitivity and improved the noise level of the reconstructed images. ICS recovery enhanced the spatial resolution and the contrast of the images was improved. As the occurrence rates of IDS and ICS were higher in GAGG than in LSO, the overall impact of IDS or ICS recovery was significant in GAGG. In conclusion, we showed that the proportional method would be suitable for IDS and ICS recoveries of PET, and emphasized the importance of ICS and IDS recoveries for PET using crystals with low stopping power.

TITLE: Depth-of-interaction encoding techniques for pixelated PET detectors enabled by machine learning methods and fast waveform digitization

AUTHORS: Bing Dai, Srilalan Krishnamoorthy, Emmanuel Morales, Suleman Surti, Joel S Karp

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Objective. Pixelated detectors with single-ended readout are routinely used by commercial positron emission tomography scanners owing to their good energy and timing resolution and optimized manufacturing, but they typically do not provide depth-of-interaction (DOI) information, which can help improve the performance of systems with higher resolution and smaller ring diameter. This work aims to develop a technique for multi-level DOI classification that does not require modifications to the detector designs.Approach. We leveraged high-speed (5 Gs s-1) waveform sampling electronics with the Domino Ring Sampler (DRS4) and machine learning (ML) methods to extract DOI information from the entire scintillation waveforms of pixelated crystals. We evaluated different grouping schemes for multi-level DOI classification by analyzing the DOI positioning profile and DOI positioning error. We examined trade-offs among crystal configurations, detector timing performance, and DOI classification accuracy. We also investigated the impact of different ML algorithms and input features-extracted from scintillation waveforms-on model accuracy.Main results. The DOI positioning profile and positioning error suggest that 2- or 3-level binning was effective for 20 mm long crystals. 2-level discrete DOI models achieved 95% class-wise accuracy and 83% overall accuracy in positioning events into the correct DOI level and 3-level up to 90% class-wise accuracy for long and narrow crystals (2 × 2 × 20 mm3). Long short-term memory networks trained with time-frequency moments were twice as efficient in training time while maintaining equal or better accuracy compared to those trained with waveforms. Classical ML algorithms exhibit comparable accuracy while consuming one order less training time than deep learning models.Significance. This work demonstrates a proof-of-concept approach for obtaining DOI information from commercially available pixelated detectors without altering the detector design thereby avoiding potential degradation in detector timing performance. It provides an alternative solution for multi-level DOI classification, potentially inspiring future scanner designs.

TITLE: Deep learning-aided respiratory motion compensation in PET/CT: addressing motion induced resolution loss, attenuation correction artifacts and PET-CT misalignment

AUTHORS: Yihuan Lu, Fei Kang, Duo Zhang, Yue Li, Hao Liu, Chen Sun, Hao Zeng, Lei Shi, Yumo Zhao, Jing Wang

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Respiratory motion (RM) significantly impacts image quality in thoracoabdominal PET/CT imaging. This study introduces a unified data-driven respiratory motion correction (uRMC) method, utilizing deep learning neural networks, to solve all the major issues caused by RM, i.e., PET resolution loss, attenuation correction artifacts, and PET-CT misalignment.

Methods: In a retrospective study, 737 patients underwent [18F]FDG PET/CT scans using the uMI Panorama PET/CT scanner. Ninety-nine patients, who also had respiration monitoring device (VSM), formed the validation set. The remaining data of the 638 patients were used to train neural networks used in the uRMC. The uRMC primarily consists of three key components: (1) data-driven respiratory signal extraction, (2) attenuation map generation, and (3) PET-CT alignment. SUV metrics were calculated within 906 lesions for three approaches, i.e., data-driven uRMC (proposed), VSM-based uRMC, and OSEM without motion correction (NMC). RM magnitude of major organs were estimated.

Results: uRMC enhanced diagnostic capabilities by revealing previously undetected lesions, sharpening lesion contours, increasing SUV values, and improving PET-CT alignment. Compared to NMC, uRMC showed increases of 10% and 17% in SUVmaxand SUVmeanacross 906 lesions. Sub-group analysis showed significant SUV increases in small and medium-sized lesions with uRMC. Minor differences were found between VSM-based and data-driven uRMC methods, with the SUVmaxwas found statistically marginal significant or insignificant between the two methods. The study observed varied motion amplitudes in major organs, typically ranging from 10 to 20 mm.

Conclusion: A data-driven solution for respiratory motion in PET/CT has been developed, validated and evaluated. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first unified solution that compensates for the motion blur within PET, the attenuation mismatch artifacts caused by PET-CT misalignment, and the misalignment between PET and CT.

TITLE: A transformer-guided cross-modality adaptive feature fusion framework for esophageal gross tumor volume segmentation

AUTHORS: Yaoting Yue, Nan Li, Gaobo Zhang, Wenyu Xing, Zhibin Zhu, Xin Liu, Shaoli Song, Dean Ta

JOURNAL: Computer methods and programs in biomedicine

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Background and objective: Accurate segmentation of esophageal gross tumor volume (GTV) indirectly enhances the efficacy of radiotherapy for patients with esophagus cancer. In this domain, learning-based methods have been employed to fuse cross-modality positron emission tomography (PET) and computed tomography (CT) images, aiming to improve segmentation accuracy. This fusion is essential as it combines functional metabolic information from PET with anatomical information from CT, providing complementary information. While the existing three-dimensional (3D) segmentation method has achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, it typically relies on pure-convolution architectures, limiting its ability to capture long-range spatial dependencies due to convolution's confinement to a local receptive field. To address this limitation and further enhance esophageal GTV segmentation performance, this work proposes a transformer-guided cross-modality adaptive feature fusion network, referred to as TransAttPSNN, which is based on cross-modality PET/CT scans.

Methods: Specifically, we establish an attention progressive semantically-nested network (AttPSNN) by incorporating the convolutional attention mechanism into the progressive semantically-nested network (PSNN). Subsequently, we devise a plug-and-play transformer-guided cross-modality adaptive feature fusion model, which is inserted between the multi-scale feature counterparts of a two-stream AttPSNN backbone (one for the PET modality flow and another for the CT modality flow), resulting in the proposed TransAttPSNN architecture.

Results: Through extensive four-fold cross-validation experiments on the clinical PET/CT cohort. The proposed approach acquires a Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.76 ± 0.13, a Hausdorff distance (HD) of 9.38 ± 8.76 mm, and a Mean surface distance (MSD) of 1.13 ± 0.94 mm, outperforming the SOTA competing methods. The qualitative results show a satisfying consistency with the lesion areas.

Conclusions: The devised transformer-guided cross-modality adaptive feature fusion module integrates the strengths of PET and CT, effectively enhancing the segmentation performance of esophageal GTV. The proposed TransAttPSNN has further advanced the research of esophageal GTV segmentation.

AUTHORS: Luca Presotto, Valentino Bettinardi, Matteo Bagnalasta, Paola Scifo, Annarita Savi, Emilia Giovanna Vanoli, Federico Fallanca, Maria Picchio, Daniela Perani, Luigi Gianolli, Elisabetta De Bernardi

JOURNAL: Journal of digital imaging

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Deep learning (DL) strategies applied to magnetic resonance (MR) images in positron emission tomography (PET)/MR can provide synthetic attenuation correction (AC) maps, and consequently PET images, more accurate than segmentation or atlas-registration strategies. As first objective, we aim to investigate the best MR image to be used and the best point of the AC pipeline to insert the synthetic map in. Sixteen patients underwent a 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/computed tomography (CT) and a PET/MR brain study in the same day. PET/CT images were reconstructed with attenuation maps obtained: (1) from CT (reference), (2) from MR with an atlas-based and a segmentation-based method and (3) with a 2D UNet trained on MR image/attenuation map pairs. As for MR, T1-weighted and Zero Time Echo (ZTE) images were considered; as for attenuation maps, CTs and 511 keV low-resolution attenuation maps were assessed. As second objective, we assessed the ability of DL strategies to provide proper AC maps in presence of cranial anatomy alterations due to surgery. Three 11C-methionine (METH) PET/MR studies were considered. PET images were reconstructed with attenuation maps obtained: (1) from diagnostic coregistered CT (reference), (2) from MR with an atlas-based and a segmentation-based method and (3) with 2D UNets trained on the sixteen FDG anatomically normal patients. Only UNets taking ZTE images in input were considered. FDG and METH PET images were quantitatively evaluated. As for anatomically normal FDG patients, UNet AC models generally provide an uptake estimate with lower bias than atlas-based or segmentation-based methods. The intersubject average bias on images corrected with UNet AC maps is always smaller than 1.5%, except for AC maps generated on too coarse grids. The intersubject bias variability is the lowest (always lower than 2%) for UNet AC maps coming from ZTE images, larger for other methods. UNet models working on MR ZTE images and generating synthetic CT or 511 keV low-resolution attenuation maps therefore provide the best results in terms of both accuracy and variability. As for METH anatomically altered patients, DL properly reconstructs anatomical alterations. Quantitative results on PET images confirm those found on anatomically normal FDG patients.

TITLE: Multicentric study on the reproducibility and robustness of PET-based radiomics features with a realistic activity painting phantom

ABSTRACT:
Previously, we developed an "activity painting" tool for PET image simulation; however, it could simulate heterogeneous patterns only in the air. We aimed to improve this phantom technique to simulate arbitrary lesions in a radioactive background to perform relevant multi-center radiomic analysis. We conducted measurements moving a 22Na point source in a 20-liter background volume filled with 5 kBq/mL activity with an adequately controlled robotic system to prevent the surge of the water. Three different lesion patterns were "activity-painted" in five PET/CT cameras, resulting in 8 different reconstructions. We calculated 46 radiomic indeces (RI) for each lesion and imaging setting, applying absolute and relative discretization. Reproducibility and reliability were determined by the inter-setting coefficient of variation (CV) and the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Hypothesis tests were used to compare RI between lesions. By simulating precisely the same lesions, we confirmed that the reconstructed voxel size and the spatial resolution of different PET cameras were critical for higher order RI. Considering conventional RIs, the SUVpeak and SUVmean proved the most reliable (CV<10%). CVs above 25% are more common for higher order RIs, but we also found that low CVs do not necessarily imply robust parameters but often rather insensitive RIs. Based on the hypothesis test, most RIs could clearly distinguish between the various lesions using absolute resampling. ICC analysis also revealed that most RIs were more reproducible with absolute discretization. The activity painting method in a real radioactive environment proved suitable for precisely detecting the radiomic differences derived from the different camera settings and texture characteristics. We also found that inter-setting CV is not an appropriate metric for analyzing RI parameters' reliability and robustness. Although multicentric cohorts are increasingly common in radiomics analysis, realistic texture phantoms can provide indispensable information on the sensitivity of an RI and how an individual RI parameter measures the texture.

TITLE: Study of low-dose PET image recovery using supervised learning with CycleGAN

AUTHORS: Kui Zhao, Long Zhou, Size Gao, Xiaozhuang Wang, Yaofa Wang, Xin Zhao, Huatao Wang, Kanfeng Liu, Yunqi Zhu, Hongwei Ye

JOURNAL: PloS one

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
PET is a popular medical imaging modality for various clinical applications, including diagnosis and image-guided radiation therapy. The low-dose PET (LDPET) at a minimized radiation dosage is highly desirable in clinic since PET imaging involves ionizing radiation, and raises concerns about the risk of radiation exposure. However, the reduced dose of radioactive tracers could impact the image quality and clinical diagnosis. In this paper, a supervised deep learning approach with a generative adversarial network (GAN) and the cycle-consistency loss, Wasserstein distance loss, and an additional supervised learning loss, named as S-CycleGAN, is proposed to establish a non-linear end-to-end mapping model, and used to recover LDPET brain images. The proposed model, and two recently-published deep learning methods (RED-CNN and 3D-cGAN) were applied to 10% and 30% dose of 10 testing datasets, and a series of simulation datasets embedded lesions with different activities, sizes, and shapes. Besides vision comparisons, six measures including the NRMSE, SSIM, PSNR, LPIPS, SUVmax and SUVmean were evaluated for 10 testing datasets and 45 simulated datasets. Our S-CycleGAN approach had comparable SSIM and PSNR, slightly higher noise but a better perception score and preserving image details, much better SUVmean and SUVmax, as compared to RED-CNN and 3D-cGAN. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations indicate the proposed approach is accurate, efficient and robust as compared to other state-of-the-art deep learning methods.

TITLE: Evaluating the impact of a rigid and a deformable registration method of pre-treatment images for hypoxia-based dose painting

JOURNAL: Physica medica : PM : an international journal devoted to the applications of physics to medicine and biology : official journal of the Italian Association of Biomedical Physics (AIFB)

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: To assess the impact of rigid and deformable image registration methods (RIR, DIR) on the outcome of a hypoxia-based dose painting strategy.

Materials and methods: Thirty head and neck cancer patients were imaged with [18F]FMISO-PET/CT before radiotherapy. [18F]FMISO-PET/CT images were registered to the planning-CT by RIR or DIR. The [18F]FMISO uptake was converted into oxygen partial pressure (pO2) maps. Hypoxic Target Volumes were contoured on pO2maps for the deformed (HTVdef) and non-deformed (HTV) cases. A dose escalation strategy by contours, aiming at 95 % tumour control probability (TCP), was applied. HTVs were characterised based on geometry-related metrics, the underlying pO2distribution, and the dose boost level. A dosimetric and radiobiological evaluation of selected treatment plans made considering RIR and DIR was performed. Moreover, the TCP of the RIR dose distribution was evaluated when considering the deformed [18F]FMISO-PET image as an indicator of the actual target radiosensitivity to determine the potential impact of an unalignment.

Results: Statistically significant differences were found between HTV and HTVdeffor volume-based metrics and underlying pO2distribution. Eight out of nine treatment plans for HTV and HTVdefshowed differences on the level 10 %/3 mm on a gamma analysis. The TCP difference, however, between RIR and the case when the RIR dose distribution was used with the deformed radiosensitivity map was below 2 pp.

Conclusions: Although the choice of the CTplan-to-PET registration method pre-treatment impacts the HTV localisation and morphology and the corresponding dose distribution, it negligibly affects the TCP in the proposed dose escalation strategy by contours.

ABSTRACT:
We introduce multiple-organ objective segmentation (MOOSE) software that generates subject-specific, multiorgan segmentation using data-centric artificial intelligence principles to facilitate high-throughput systemic investigations of the human body via whole-body PET imaging.Methods:Image data from 2 PET/CT systems were used in training MOOSE. For noncerebral structures, 50 whole-body CT images were used, 30 of which were acquired from healthy controls (14 men and 16 women), and 20 datasets were acquired from oncology patients (14 men and 6 women). Noncerebral tissues consisted of 13 abdominal organs, 20 bone segments, subcutaneous fat, visceral fat, psoas muscle, and skeletal muscle. An expert panel manually segmented all noncerebral structures except for subcutaneous fat, visceral fat, and skeletal muscle, which were semiautomatically segmented using thresholding. A majority-voting algorithm was used to generate a reference-standard segmentation. From the 50 CT datasets, 40 were used for training and 10 for testing. For cerebral structures, 3418F-FDG PET/MRI brain image volumes were used from 10 healthy controls (5 men and 5 women imaged twice) and 14 nonlesional epilepsy patients (7 men and 7 women). Only18F-FDG PET images were considered for training: 24 and 10 of 34 volumes were used for training and testing, respectively. The Dice score coefficient (DSC) was used as the primary metric, and the average symmetric surface distance as a secondary metric, to evaluate the automated segmentation performance.Results:An excellent overlap between the reference labels and MOOSE-derived organ segmentations was observed: 92% of noncerebral tissues showed DSCs of more than 0.90, whereas a few organs exhibited lower DSCs (e.g., adrenal glands [0.72], pancreas [0.85], and bladder [0.86]). The median DSCs of brain subregions derived from PET images were lower. Only 29% of the brain segments had a median DSC of more than 0.90, whereas segmentation of 60% of regions yielded a median DSC of 0.80-0.89. The results of the average symmetric surface distance analysis demonstrated that the average distance between the reference standard and the automatically segmented tissue surfaces (organs, bones, and brain regions) lies within the size of image voxels (2 mm).Conclusion:The proposed segmentation pipeline allows automatic segmentation of 120 unique tissues from whole-body18F-FDG PET/CT images with high accuracy.

TITLE: Segmentation-guided Denoising Network for Low-dose CT Imaging

AUTHORS: Zhenxing Huang, Zhou Liu, Pin He, Ya Ren, Shuluan Li, Yuanyuan Lei, Dehong Luo, Dong Liang, Dan Shao, Zhanli Hu, Na Zhang

JOURNAL: Computer methods and programs in biomedicine

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Background: To reduce radiation exposure and improve diagnosis in low-dose computed tomography, several deep learning (DL)-based image denoising methods have been proposed to suppress noise and artifacts over the past few years. However, most of them seek an objective data distribution approximating the gold standard and neglect structural semantic preservation. Moreover, the numerical response in CT images presents substantial regional anatomical differences among tissues in terms of X-ray absorbency.

Methods: In this paper, we introduce structural semantic information for low-dose CT imaging. First, the regional segmentation prior to low-dose CT can guide the denoising process. Second the structural semantical results can be considered as evaluation metrics on the estimated normal-dose CT images. Then, a semantic feature transform is engaged to combine the semantic and image features on a semantic fusion module. In addition, the structural semantic loss function is introduced to measure the segmentation difference.

Results: Experiments are conducted on clinical abdomen data obtained from a clinical hospital, and the semantic labels consist of subcutaneous fat, muscle and visceral fat associated with body physical evaluation. Compared with other DL-based methods, the proposed method achieves better performance on quantitative metrics and better semantic evaluation.

Conclusions: The quantitative experimental results demonstrate the promising performance of the proposed methods in noise reduction and structural semantic preservation. While, the proposed method may suffer from several limitations on abnormalities, unknown noise and different manufacturers. In the future, the proposed method will be further explored, and wider applications in PET/CT and PET/MR will be sought.

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
PET/MRI scanners cannot be qualified in the manner adopted for hybrid PET/CT devices. The main hurdle with qualification in PET/MRI is that attenuation correction (AC) cannot be adequately measured in conventional PET phantoms because of the difficulty in converting the MR images of the physical structures (e.g., plastic) into electron density maps. Over the last decade, a plethora of novel MRI-based algorithms has been developed to more accurately derive the attenuation properties of the human head, including the skull. Although promising, none of these techniques has yet emerged as an optimal and universally adopted strategy for AC in PET/MRI. In this work, we propose a path for PET/MRI qualification for multicenter brain imaging studies. Specifically, our solution is to separate the head AC from the other factors that affect PET data quantification and use a patient as a phantom to assess the former. The emission data collected on the integrated PET/MRI scanner to be qualified should be reconstructed using both MRI- and CT-based AC methods, and whole-brain qualitative and quantitative (both voxelwise and regional) analyses should be performed. The MRI-based approach will be considered satisfactory if the PET quantification bias is within the acceptance criteria specified here. We have implemented this approach successfully across 2 PET/MRI scanner manufacturers at 2 sites.

TITLE: Vascular segmentation of functional ultrasound images using deep learning

AUTHORS: Hana Sebia, Thomas Guyet, Mickaël Pereira, Marco Valdebenito, Hugues Berry, Benjamin Vidal

JOURNAL: Computers in biology and medicine

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Segmentation of medical images is a fundamental task with numerous applications. While MRI, CT, and PET modalities have significantly benefited from deep learning segmentation techniques, more recent modalities, like functional ultrasound (fUS), have seen limited progress. fUS is a non invasive imaging method that measures changes in cerebral blood volume (CBV) with high spatio-temporal resolution. However, distinguishing arterioles from venules in fUS is challenging due to opposing blood flow directions within the same pixel. Ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM) can enhance resolution by tracking microbubble contrast agents but is invasive, and lacks dynamic CBV quantification. In this paper, we introduce the first deep learning-based application for fUS image segmentation, capable of differentiating signals based on vertical flow direction (upward vs. downward), using ULM-based automatic annotation, and enabling dynamic CBV quantification. In the cortical vasculature, this distinction in flow direction provides a proxy for differentiating arteries from veins. We evaluate various UNet architectures on fUS images of rat brains, achieving competitive segmentation performance, with 90% accuracy, a 71% F1 score, and an IoU of 0.59, using only 100 temporal frames from a fUS stack. These results are comparable to those from tubular structure segmentation in other imaging modalities. Additionally, models trained on resting-state data generalize well to images captured during visual stimulation, highlighting robustness. Although it does not reach the full granularity of ULM, the proposed method provides a practical, non-invasive and cost-effective solution for inferring flow direction-particularly valuable in scenarios where ULM is not available or feasible. Our pipeline shows high linear correlation coefficients between signals from predicted and actual compartments, showcasing its ability to accurately capture blood flow dynamics.

TITLE: Impact of respiratory motion on 18 F-FDG PET radiomics stability: Clinical evaluation with a digital PET scanner

AUTHORS: Yu-Hung Chen, Kuo-Yi Kan, Shu-Hsin Liu, Hsin-Hon Lin, Kun-Han Lue

JOURNAL: Journal of applied clinical medical physics

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: 18F-FDG PET quantitative features are susceptible to respiratory motion. However, studies using clinical patient data to explore the impact of respiratory motion on18F-FDG PET radiomic features are limited. In this study, we investigated the impact of respiratory motion on radiomics stability with clinical18F-FDG PET images using a data-driven gating (DDG) algorithm on the digital PET scanner.

Materials and methods: A total of 101 patients who underwent oncological18F-FDG PET scans were retrospectively included. A DDG algorithm combined with a motion compensation technique was used to extract the PET images with respiratory motion correction.18F-FDG-avid lesions from the thorax to the upper abdomen were analyzed on the non-DDG and DDG PET images. The lesions were segmented with a 40% threshold of the maximum standardized uptake. A total of 725 radiomic features were computed from the segmented lesions, including first-order, shape, texture, and wavelet features. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and coefficient of variation (COV) were calculated to evaluate feature stability. An ICC above 0.9 and a COV below 5% were considered high stability.

Results: In total, 168 lesions with and without respiratory motion correction were analyzed. Our results indicated that most18F-FDG PET radiomic features are sensitive to respiratory motion. Overall, only 27 out of 725 (3.72%) radiomic features were identified as highly stable, including one from the first-order features (entropy), one from the shape features (sphericity), four from the gray-level co-occurrence matrix features (normalized and unnormalized inverse difference moment, joint entropy, and sum entropy), one from the gray-level run-length matrix features (run entropy), and 20 from the wavelet filter-based features.

Conclusion: Respiratory motion has a significant impact on18F-FDG PET radiomics stability. The highly stable features identified in our study may serve as potential candidates for further applications, such as machine learning modeling.

JOURNAL: Japanese journal of radiology

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: This multisite study aimed to use the COMBined Association Test (COMBAT), a harmonization technique that uses regression of covariates with an empirical Bayesian framework, to harmonize diffusion tensor image analysis along the perivascular space (DTI-ALPS) variations caused by scanner, site, and protocol differences.

Materials and methods: This study included multisite diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) data of 45 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 82 cognitively normal (CN) participants from the AD neuroimaging initiative database. The dMRI data were obtained with two b values (0 and 1000 s/mm2) from 27 institutions and three different 3-Tesla MRI scanners (two vendors). The ALPS index was calculated from multisite dMRI data, and COMBAT was used to harmonize the factors causing site variations. Welch's t test was used, Cohen's d was calculated to compare the difference in the ALPS index between AD and CN before and after harmonization, and Pearson's correlation coefficient was calculated to assess the relationships between the ALPS index and the cognitive score, [18F] fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET), and [18F] florbetapir (AV45)-PET standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs).

Results: COMBAT harmonized scanner differences and increased Cohen's d of the left and right ALPS indexes between AD and CN from 0.288 to 0.438 and 0.328 to 0.480, respectively. The ALPS indexes were significantly different between AD and CN after harmonization (P < 0.05) but not before it. Moreover, Pearson's correlation coefficients between the ALPS index and cognitive score, FDG-PET, and AV45-PET SUVRs were higher after harmonization than before it.

Conclusion: This study demonstrates the application of COMBAT harmonization to eliminate between-scanner, site, and protocol variations in the ALPS index calculated from DTI-ALPS using dMRI and possibly facilitate the use of the ALPS index in multi-center studies.

TITLE: A deep neural network for fast and accurate scatter estimation in quantitative SPECT/CT under challenging scatter conditions

AUTHORS: Haowei Xiang, Hongki Lim, Jeffrey A Fessler, Yuni K Dewaraja

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: A major challenge for accurate quantitative SPECT imaging of some radionuclides is the inadequacy of simple energy window-based scatter estimation methods, widely available on clinic systems. A deep learning approach for SPECT/CT scatter estimation is investigated as an alternative to computationally expensive Monte Carlo (MC) methods for challenging SPECT radionuclides, such as90Y.

Methods: A deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) was trained to separately estimate each scatter projection from the measured90Y bremsstrahlung SPECT emission projection and CT attenuation projection that form the network inputs. The 13-layer deep architecture consisted of separate paths for the emission and attenuation projection that are concatenated before the final convolution steps. The training label consisted of MC-generated "true" scatter projections in phantoms (MC is needed only for training) with the mean square difference relative to the model output serving as the loss function. The test data set included a simulated sphere phantom with a lung insert, measurements of a liver phantom, and patients after90Y radioembolization. OS-EM SPECT reconstruction without scatter correction (NO-SC), with the true scatter (TRUE-SC) (available for simulated data only), with the DCNN estimated scatter (DCNN-SC), and with a previously developed MC scatter model (MC-SC) were compared, including with90Y PET when available.

Results: The contrast recovery (CR) vs. noise and lung insert residual error vs. noise curves for images reconstructed with DCNN-SC and MC-SC estimates were similar. At the same noise level of 10% (across multiple realizations), the average sphere CR was 24%, 52%, 55%, and 67% for NO-SC, MC-SC, DCNN-SC, and TRUE-SC, respectively. For the liver phantom, the average CR for liver inserts were 32%, 73%, and 65% for NO-SC, MC-SC, and DCNN-SC, respectively while the corresponding values for average contrast-to-noise ratio (visibility index) in low-concentration extra-hepatic inserts were 2, 19, and 61, respectively. In patients, there was high concordance between lesion-to-liver uptake ratios for SPECT reconstruction with DCNN-SC (median 4.8, range 0.02-13.8) compared with MC-SC (median 4.0, range 0.13-12.1; CCC = 0.98) and with90Y PET (median 4.9, range 0.02-11.2; CCC = 0.96) while the concordance with NO-SC was poor (median 2.8, range 0.3-7.2; CCC = 0.59). The trained DCNN took ~ 40 s (using a single i5 processor on a desktop computer) to generate the scatter estimates for all 128 views in a patient scan, compared to ~ 80 min for the MC scatter model using 12 processors.

Conclusions: For diverse90Y test data that included patient studies, we demonstrated comparable performance between images reconstructed with deep learning and MC-based scatter estimates using metrics relevant for dosimetry and for safety. This approach that can be generalized to other radionuclides by changing the training data is well suited for real-time clinical use because of the high speed, orders of magnitude faster than MC, while maintaining high accuracy.

TITLE: Multi-organ segmentation of CT via convolutional neural network: impact of training setting and scanner manufacturer

AUTHORS: Amy J Weisman, Daniel T Huff, Rajkumar Munian Govindan, Song Chen, Timothy G Perk

JOURNAL: Biomedical physics & engineering express

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Objective. Automated organ segmentation on CT images can enable the clinical use of advanced quantitative software devices, but model performance sensitivities must be understood before widespread adoption can occur. The goal of this study was to investigate performance differences between Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) trained to segment one (single-class) versus multiple (multi-class) organs, and between CNNs trained on scans from a single manufacturer versus multiple manufacturers.Methods. The multi-class CNN was trained on CT images obtained from 455 whole-body PET/CT scans (413 for training, 42 for testing) taken with Siemens, GE, and Phillips PET/CT scanners where 16 organs were segmented. The multi-class CNN was compared to 16 smaller single-class CNNs trained using the same data, but with segmentations of only one organ per model. In addition, CNNs trained on Siemens-only (N = 186) and GE-only (N = 219) scans (manufacturer-specific) were compared with CNNs trained on data from both Siemens and GE scanners (manufacturer-mixed). Segmentation performance was quantified using five performance metrics, including the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC).Results. The multi-class CNN performed well compared to previous studies, even in organs usually considered difficult auto-segmentation targets (e.g., pancreas, bowel). Segmentations from the multi-class CNN were significantly superior to those from smaller single-class CNNs in most organs, and the 16 single-class models took, on average, six times longer to segment all 16 organs compared to the single multi-class model. The manufacturer-mixed approach achieved minimally higher performance over the manufacturer-specific approach.Significance. A CNN trained on contours of multiple organs and CT data from multiple manufacturers yielded high-quality segmentations. Such a model is an essential enabler of image processing in a software device that quantifies and analyzes such data to determine a patient's treatment response. To date, this activity of whole organ segmentation has not been adopted due to the intense manual workload and time required.

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Objective.This study addresses a fundamental limitation of in-beam positron emission tomography (IB-PET) in proton therapy: the lack of direct anatomical representation in the images it produces. We aim to overcome this shortcoming by pioneering the application of deep learning techniques to create synthetic control CT images (sCT) from combining IB-PET and planning CT scan data.Approach.We conducted simulations involving six patients who underwent irradiation with proton beams. Leveraging the architecture of a visual transformer (ViT) neural network, we developed a model to generate sCT images of these patients using the planning CT scans and the inter-fractional simulated PET activity maps during irradiation. To evaluate the model's performance, a comparison was conducted between the sCT images produced by the ViT model and the authentic control CT images-serving as the benchmark.Main results.The structural similarity index was computed at a mean value across all patients of 0.91, while the mean absolute error measured 22 Hounsfield Units (HU). Root mean squared error and peak signal-to-noise ratio values were 56 HU and 30 dB, respectively. The Dice similarity coefficient exhibited a value of 0.98. These values are comparable to or exceed those found in the literature. More than 70% of the synthetic morphological changes were found to be geometrically compatible with the ones reported in the real control CT scan.Significance.Our study presents an innovative approach to surface the hidden anatomical information of IB-PET in proton therapy. Our ViT-based model successfully generates sCT images from inter-fractional PET data and planning CT scans. Our model's performance stands on par with existing models relying on input from cone beam CT or magnetic resonance imaging, which contain more anatomical information than activity maps.

TITLE: Automated dynamic motion correction using normalized gradient fields for 82rubidium PET myocardial blood flow quantification

AUTHORS: Benjamin C Lee, Jonathan B Moody, Alexis Poitrasson-Rivière, Amanda C Melvin, Richard L Weinberg, James R Corbett, Venkatesh L Murthy, Edward P Ficaro

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear cardiology : official publication of the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Background: Patient motion can lead to misalignment of left ventricular (LV) volumes-of-interest (VOIs) and subsequently inaccurate quantification of myocardial blood flow (MBF) and flow reserve (MFR) from dynamic PET myocardial perfusion images. We aimed to develop an image-based 3D-automated motion-correction algorithm that corrects the full dynamic sequence for translational motion, especially in the early blood phase frames (~ first minute) where the injected tracer activity is transitioning from the blood pool to the myocardium and where conventional image registration algorithms have had limited success.

Methods: We studied 225 consecutive patients who underwent dynamic rest/stress rubidium-82 chloride (82Rb) PET imaging. Dynamic image series consisting of 30 frames were reconstructed with frame durations ranging from 5 to 80 seconds. An automated algorithm localized the RV and LV blood pools in space and time and then registered each frame to a tissue reference image volume using normalized gradient fields with a modification of a signed distance function. The computed shifts and their global and regional flow estimates were compared to those of reference shifts that were assessed by three physician readers.

Results: The automated motion-correction shifts were within 5 mm of the manual motion-correction shifts across the entire sequence. The automated and manual motion-correction global MBF values had excellent linear agreement (R = 0.99, y = 0.97x + 0.06). Uncorrected flows outside of the limits of agreement with the manual motion-corrected flows were brought into agreement in 90% of the cases for global MBF and in 87% of the cases for global MFR. The limits of agreement for stress MBF were also reduced twofold globally and by fourfold in the RCA territory.

Conclusions: An image-based, automated motion-correction algorithm for dynamic PET across the entire dynamic sequence using normalized gradient fields matched the results of manual motion correction in reducing bias and variance in MBF and MFR, particularly in the RCA territory.

TITLE: Accurate total-body Ki parametric imaging with shortened dynamic 18 F-FDG PET scan durations via effective data processing

AUTHORS: Zixiang Chen, Zhaoping Cheng, Yanhua Duan, Qiyang Zhang, Na Zhang, Fengyun Gu, Ying Wang, Yun Zhou, Haining Wang, Dong Liang, Hairong Zheng, Zhanli Hu

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Background: Total-body dynamic positron emission tomography (dPET) imaging using18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) has received widespread attention in clinical oncology. However, the conventionally required scan duration of approximately 1 h seriously limits the application and promotion of this imaging technique. In this study, we investigated the possibility and feasibility of shortening the total-body dynamic scan duration to 30 min post-injection (PI) with the help of a novel Patlak data processing algorithm for accurate Kiestimations of tumor lesions.

Methods: Total-body dPET images acquired by uEXPLORER (United Imaging Healthcare Inc.) using18F-FDG of 15 patients with different tumor types were analyzed in this study. Dynamic images were reconstructed into 25 frames with a specific temporal dividing protocol for the scan data acquired 1 h PI. Patlak analysis-based Kiparametric imaging was conducted based on the imaging data corresponding to the first 30 min PI, during which a Patlak data processing method based on cubic Hermite interpolation was applied. The resultant Kiimages acquired by 30 min dynamic PET data and the standard 1 h Kiimages were compared in terms of visual imaging effect, region signal-to-noise ratio, and Kiestimation accuracy to evaluate the performance of the proposed Kiimaging method with a shortened scan duration.

Results: With the help of Patlak data processing, acceptable Kiparametric images were obtained from dynamic PET data acquired with a scan duration of 30 min PI. Compared with Kiimages obtained from unprocessed Patlak data, the resulting images from the proposed method performed better in terms of noise reduction. Moreover, Bland-Altman plot and Pearson correlation coefficient analysis showed that that 30 min Kiimages obtained from the processed Patlak data had higher accuracy for tumor lesions.

Conclusion: Satisfactory Kiparametric images with high tumor accuracy can be acquired from dynamic imaging data corresponding to the first 30 min PI. Patlak data processing can help achieve higher Kiimaging quality and higher accuracy regarding tumor lesion Kivalues. Clinically, it is possible to shorten the dynamic scan duration of18F-FDG PET to 30 min to acquire an accurate tumor Kiand further effective tumor detection with uEXPLORER scanners.

TITLE: Recent developments in denoising medical images using deep learning: An overview of models, techniques, and challenges

AUTHORS: Nahida Nazir, Abid Sarwar, Baljit Singh Saini

JOURNAL: Micron (Oxford, England : 1993)

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Medical imaging plays a critical role in diagnosing and treating various medical conditions. However, interpreting medical images can be challenging even for expert clinicians, as they are often degraded by noise and artifacts that can hinder the accurate identification and analysis of diseases, leading to severe consequences such as patient misdiagnosis or mortality. Various types of noise, including Gaussian, Rician, and Salt-pepper noise, can corrupt the area of interest, limiting the precision and accuracy of algorithms. Denoising algorithms have shown the potential in improving the quality of medical images by removing noise and other artifacts that obscure essential information. Deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool for image analysis and has demonstrated promising results in denoising different medical images such as MRIs, CT scans, PET scans, etc. This review paper provides a comprehensive overview of state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms used for denoising medical images. A total of 120 relevant papers were reviewed, and after screening with specific inclusion and exclusion criteria, 104 papers were selected for analysis. This study aims to provide a thorough understanding for researchers in the field of intelligent denoising by presenting an extensive survey of current techniques and highlighting significant challenges that remain to be addressed. The findings of this review are expected to contribute to the development of intelligent models that enable timely and accurate diagnoses of medical disorders. It was found that 40% of the researchers used models based on Deep convolutional neural networks to denoise the images, followed by encoder-decoder (18%) and other artificial intelligence-based techniques (15%) (Like DIP, etc.). Generative adversarial network was used by 12%, transformer-based approaches (13%) and multilayer perceptron was used by 2% of the researchers. Moreover, Gaussian noise was present in 35% of the images, followed by speckle noise (16%), poisson noise (14%), artifacts (10%), rician noise (7%), Salt-pepper noise (6%), Impulse noise (3%) and other types of noise (9%). While the progress in developing novel models for the denoising of medical images is evident, significant work remains to be done in creating standardized denoising models that perform well across a wide spectrum of medical images. Overall, this review highlights the importance of denoising medical images and provides a comprehensive understanding of the current state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms in this field.

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Phantoms mimicking human tissue heterogeneity and intensity are required to establish radiomic features robustness in Computed Tomography (CT) images. We developed inserts with two different techniques for the radiomic study of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) lesions.

Methods: We developed two insert prototypes: two 3D-printed made of glycol-modified polyethylene terephthalate (PET-G), and nine with sodium polyacrylate plus iodinated contrast medium. The inserts were put in a handcraft phantom (HeLLePhant). We also analysed four materials of a commercial homogeneous phantom (Catphan® 424) and collected 29 NSCLC patients for comparison. All the CT acquisitions were performed with the same clinical protocol and scanner at 120kVp. The HeLLePhant phantom was scanned ten times in fixed condition at 120kVp and 100kVp for repeatability investigation. We extracted 153 radiomic features using Pyradiomics. To compare the features between phantoms and patients, we computed how many phantom features fell in the range between 10th and 90th percentile of the corresponding patient values. We deemed repeatable the features with a coefficient of variation (CV) less than or equal to 0.10.

Results: The best similarity with the patients was obtained with the polyacrylate inserts (55.6-90.2%), the worst with Catphan (15.7-19.0%). For the PET-G inserts 35.3% and 36.6% of the features match the patient range. We found high repeatability for all the inserts of the HeLLePhant phantom (74.3-100% at 120kVp, 75.7-97.9% at 100kVp), and observed a texture dependency in repeatability.

Conclusions: Our study shows a promising way to construct heterogeneous inserts mimicking a target tissue for radiomic studies.

TITLE: A physics-guided modular deep-learning based automated framework for tumor segmentation in PET

AUTHORS: Kevin H Leung, Wael Marashdeh, Rick Wray, Saeed Ashrafinia, Martin G Pomper, Arman Rahmim, Abhinav K Jha

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
An important need exists for reliable positron emission tomography (PET) tumor-segmentation methods for tasks such as PET-based radiation-therapy planning and reliable quantification of volumetric and radiomic features. To address this need, we propose an automated physics-guided deep-learning-based three-module framework to segment PET images on a per-slice basis. The framework is designed to help address the challenges of limited spatial resolution and lack of clinical training data with known ground-truth tumor boundaries in PET. The first module generates PET images containing highly realistic tumors with known ground-truth using a new stochastic and physics-based approach, addressing lack of training data. The second module trains a modified U-net using these images, helping it learn the tumor-segmentation task. The third module fine-tunes this network using a small-sized clinical dataset with radiologist-defined delineations as surrogate ground-truth, helping the framework learn features potentially missed in simulated tumors. The framework was evaluated in the context of segmenting primary tumors in18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET images of patients with lung cancer. The framework's accuracy, generalizability to different scanners, sensitivity to partial volume effects (PVEs) and efficacy in reducing the number of training images were quantitatively evaluated using Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and several other metrics. The framework yielded reliable performance in both simulated (DSC: 0.87 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.86, 0.88)) and patient images (DSC: 0.73 (95% CI: 0.71, 0.76)), outperformed several widely used semi-automated approaches, accurately segmented relatively small tumors (smallest segmented cross-section was 1.83 cm2), generalized across five PET scanners (DSC: 0.74 (95% CI: 0.71, 0.76)), was relatively unaffected by PVEs, and required low training data (training with data from even 30 patients yielded DSC of 0.70 (95% CI: 0.68, 0.71)). In conclusion, the proposed automated physics-guided deep-learning-based PET-segmentation framework yielded reliable performance in delineating tumors in FDG-PET images of patients with lung cancer.

TITLE: Parametric imaging of myocardial blood flow with 82Rb PET: An accuracy and image quality analysis

AUTHORS: Chad R R N Hunter, Eric Moulton, Rob S B Beanlands, Robert A deKemp

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear cardiology : official publication of the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Background: We aimed to develop a framework for generating three-dimensional (3D) myocardial blood flow (MBF) images, computing their accuracy against clinically validated two-dimensional (2D) polar MBF maps of the left ventricle, and evaluating their improvements in image quality over relative myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI).

Methods: N = 40 patients with a wide range of defect severities and uptake dynamics were retrospectively studied. The FlowQuant™ software was used to generate reference MPI and polar MBF maps and was adapted for voxel-wise MBF mapping. We evaluated agreement between parametric vs polar values for MBF at rest and stress and for reserve (stress/rest MBF). We also assessed improvements in image quality, assessed by signal-to-noise ratio, contrast-to-noise ratio, tissue-to-blood ratio, and defect severity, from relative MPI to MBF.

Results: There was excellent agreement between 3D parametric and 2D polar maps for all flow parameters (interclass correlation coefficient >0.96), albeit with minimal bias (<8%) for rest and stress MBF at the patient level. Image quality substantially improved from MPI to MBF in every patient for all image-quality metrics (P < 0.0001) CONCLUSIONS: We developed a robust methodology for producing highly accurate 3D MBF images exhibiting considerably improved image quality compared to relative MPI commonly used in clinical practice.

ABSTRACT:
The LabPET II is a new positron emission tomography technology platform designed to achieve submillimetric spatial resolution imaging using fully pixelated avalanche photodiodes-based detectors and highly integrated parallel front-end processing electronics. The detector was designed as a generic building block to develop devices for preclinical imaging of small to mid-sized animals and for clinical imaging of the human brain. The aim of this work is to assess the physical characteristics and imaging performance of the mouse version of LabPET II scanner following the NEMA NU4-2008 standard and using high resolution phantoms and in vivo imaging applications. A reconstructed spatial resolution of 0.78 mm (0.5 μ l) is measured close to the center of the radial field of view. With an energy window of 350 650 keV, the system absolute sensitivity is 1.2% and its maximum noise equivalent count rate reaches 61.1 kcps at 117 MBq. Submillimetric spatial resolution is achieved in a hot spot phantom and tiny bone structures were resolved with unprecedented contrast in the mouse. These results provide convincing evidence of the capabilities of the LabPET II technology for biomolecular imaging in preclinical research.

ABSTRACT:
Objective. Accurate and reproducible tumor delineation on positron emission tomography (PET) images is required to validate predictive and prognostic models based on PET radiomic features. Manual segmentation of tumors is time-consuming whereas semi-automatic methods are easily implementable and inexpensive. This study assessed the reliability of semi-automatic segmentation methods over manual segmentation for tumor delineation in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) PET images.Approach. We employed manual and six semi-automatic segmentation methods (just enough interaction (JEI), watershed, grow from seeds (GfS), flood filling (FF), 30% SUVmax and 40%SUVmax threshold) using 3D slicer software to extract 128 radiomic features from FDG-PET images of 100 HNSCC patients independently by three operators. We assessed the distributional properties of all features and considered 92 log-transformed features for subsequent analysis. For each paired comparison of a feature, we fitted a separate linear mixed effect model using the method (two levels; manual versus one semi-automatic method) as a fixed effect and the subject and the operator as the random effects. We estimated different statistics-the intraclass correlation coefficient agreement (aICC), limits of agreement (LoA), total deviation index (TDI), coverage probability (CP) and coefficient of individual agreement (CIA)-to evaluate the agreement between the manual and semi-automatic methods.Main results. Accounting for all statistics across 92 features, the JEI method consistently demonstrated acceptable agreement with the manual method, with median values of aICC = 0.86, TDI = 0.94, CP = 0.66, and CIA = 0.91.Significance. This study demonstrated that JEI method is a reliable semi-automatic method for tumor delineation on HNSCC PET images.

TITLE: Data-efficient generalization of AI transformers for noise reduction in ultra-fast lung PET scans

AUTHORS: Jiale Wang, Xinyu Zhang, Ying Miao, Song Xue, Yu Zhang, Kuangyu Shi, Rui Guo, Biao Li, Guoyan Zheng

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Respiratory motion during PET acquisition may produce lesion blurring. Ultra-fast 20-second breath-hold (U2BH) PET reduces respiratory motion artifacts, but the shortened scanning time increases statistical noise and may affect diagnostic quality. This study aims to denoise the U2BH PET images using a deep learning (DL)-based method.

Methods: The study was conducted on two datasets collected from five scanners where the first dataset included 1272 retrospectively collected full-time PET data while the second dataset contained 46 prospectively collected U2BH and the corresponding full-time PET/CT images. A robust and data-efficient DL method called mask vision transformer (Mask-ViT) was proposed which, after fine-tuned on a limited number of training data from a target scanner, was directly applied to unseen testing data from new scanners. The performance of Mask-ViT was compared with state-of-the-art DL methods including U-Net and C-Gan taking the full-time PET images as the reference. Statistical analysis on image quality metrics were carried out with Wilcoxon signed-rank test. For clinical evaluation, two readers scored image quality on a 5-point scale (5 = excellent) and provided a binary assessment for diagnostic quality evaluation.

Results: The U2BH PET images denoised by Mask-ViT showed statistically significant improvement over U-Net and C-Gan on image quality metrics (p < 0.05). For clinical evaluation, Mask-ViT exhibited a lesion detection accuracy of 91.3%, 90.4% and 91.7%, when it was evaluated on three different scanners.

Conclusion: Mask-ViT can effectively enhance the quality of the U2BH PET images in a data-efficient generalization setup. The denoised images meet clinical diagnostic requirements of lesion detectability.

TITLE: Pre-acquired CT-based attenuation correction with automated headrest removal for a brain-dedicated PET system

AUTHORS: Yuma Iwao, Go Akamatsu, Hideaki Tashima, Miwako Takahashi, Taiga Yamaya

JOURNAL: Radiological physics and technology

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Attenuation correction (AC) is essential for quantitative positron emission tomography (PET) images. Attenuation coefficient maps (μ-maps) are usually generated from computed tomography (CT) images when PET-CT combined systems are used. If CT has been performed prior to PET imaging, pre-acquired CT can be used for brain PET AC, because the human head is almost rigid. This pre-acquired CT-based AC approach is suitable for stand-alone brain-dedicated PET, such as VRAIN (ATOX Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). However, the headrest of PET is different from the headrest in pre-acquired CT images, which may degrade the PET image quality. In this study, we prepared three different types of μ-maps: (1) based on the pre-acquired CT, where namely the headrest is different from the PET system (μ-map-diffHr); (2) manually removing the headrest from the pre-acquired CT (μ-map-noHr); and (3) artificially replacing the headrest region with the headrest of the PET system (μ-map-sameHr). Phantom images by VRAIN using each μ-map were investigated for uniformity, noise, and quantitative accuracy. Consequently, only the uniformity of the images using μ-map-diffHr was out of the acceptance criteria. We then proposed an automated method for removing the headrest from pre-acquired CT images. In comparisons of standardized uptake values in nine major brain regions from the18F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose-PET of 10 healthy volunteers, no significant differences were found between the μ-map-noHr and the μ-map-sameHr. In conclusion, pre-acquired CT-based AC with automated headrest removal is useful for brain-dedicated PET such as VRAIN.

TITLE: Feasibility of Deep Learning-Guided Attenuation and Scatter Correction of Whole-Body 68Ga-PSMA PET Studies in the Image Domain

AUTHORS: Samaneh Mostafapour, Faeze Gholamiankhah, Habibollah Dadgar, Hossein Arabi, Habib Zaidi

JOURNAL: Clinical nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Objective: This study evaluates the feasibility of direct scatter and attenuation correction of whole-body 68Ga-PSMA PET images in the image domain using deep learning.

Methods: Whole-body 68Ga-PSMA PET images of 399 subjects were used to train a residual deep learning model, taking PET non-attenuation-corrected images (PET-nonAC) as input and CT-based attenuation-corrected PET images (PET-CTAC) as target (reference). Forty-six whole-body 68Ga-PSMA PET images were used as an independent validation dataset. For validation, synthetic deep learning-based attenuation-corrected PET images were assessed considering the corresponding PET-CTAC images as reference. The evaluation metrics included the mean absolute error (MAE) of the SUV, peak signal-to-noise ratio, and structural similarity index (SSIM) in the whole body, as well as in different regions of the body, namely, head and neck, chest, and abdomen and pelvis.

Results: The deep learning-guided direct attenuation and scatter correction produced images of comparable visual quality to PET-CTAC images. It achieved an MAE, relative error (RE%), SSIM, and peak signal-to-noise ratio of 0.91 ± 0.29 (SUV), -2.46% ± 10.10%, 0.973 ± 0.034, and 48.171 ± 2.964, respectively, within whole-body images of the independent external validation dataset. The largest RE% was observed in the head and neck region (-5.62% ± 11.73%), although this region exhibited the highest value of SSIM metric (0.982 ± 0.024). The MAE (SUV) and RE% within the different regions of the body were less than 2.0% and 6%, respectively, indicating acceptable performance of the deep learning model.

Conclusions: This work demonstrated the feasibility of direct attenuation and scatter correction of whole-body 68Ga-PSMA PET images in the image domain using deep learning with clinically tolerable errors. The technique has the potential of performing attenuation correction on stand-alone PET or PET/MRI systems.

ABSTRACT:
Medical imaging plays a pivotal role in diagnostic medicine with technologies like Magnetic Resonance Imagining (MRI), Computed Tomography (CT), Positron Emission Tomography (PET), and ultrasound scans being widely used to assist radiologists and medical experts in reaching concrete diagnosis. Given the recent massive uplift in the storage and processing capabilities of computers, and the publicly available big data, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has also started contributing to improving diagnostic radiology. Edge computing devices and handheld gadgets can serve as useful tools to process medical data in remote areas with limited network and computational resources. In this research, the capabilities of multiple platforms are evaluated for the real-time deployment of diagnostic tools. MRI classification and segmentation applications developed in previous studies are used for testing the performance using different hardware and software configurations. Cost-benefit analysis is carried out using a workstation with a NVIDIA Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), Jetson Xavier NX, Raspberry Pi 4B, and Android phone, using MATLAB, Python, and Android Studio. The mean computational times for the classification app on the PC, Jetson Xavier NX, and Raspberry Pi are 1.2074, 3.7627, and 3.4747 s, respectively. On the low-cost Android phone, this time is observed to be 0.1068 s using the Dynamic Range Quantized TFLite version of the baseline model, with slight degradation in accuracy. For the segmentation app, the times are 1.8241, 5.2641, 6.2162, and 3.2023 s, respectively, when using JPEG inputs. The Jetson Xavier NX and Android phone stand out as the best platforms due to their compact size, fast inference times, and affordability.

TITLE: Generation of18F-FDG PET standard scan images from short scans using cycle-consistent generative adversarial network

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

ABSTRACT:
Objective.To improve positron emission tomography (PET) image quality, we aim to generate images of quality comparable to standard scan duration images using short scan duration (1/8 and 1/16 standard scan duration) inputs and assess the generated standard scan duration images quantitative and qualitatively. Also, the effect of training dataset properties (i.e. body mass index (BMI)) on the performance of the model(s) will be explored.Approach.Whole-body PET scans of 42 patients (4118F-FDG and one68Ga-PSMA) scanned with standard radiotracer dosage were included in this study. One18F-FDG patient data was set aside and the remaining 40 patients were split into four subsets of 10 patients with different mean patient BMI. Multiple copies of a developed cycle-GAN network were trained on each subset to predict standard scan images using 1/8 and 1/16 short duration scans. Also, the models' performance was tested on a patient scanned with the68Ga-PSMA radiotracer. Quantitative performance was tested using peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index (SSIM), and normalized root mean squared error (NRMSE) metrics, and two nuclear medicine specialists analyzed images qualitatively.Main results.The developed cycle-GAN model improved the PSNR, SSIM, and NRMSE of the 1/8 and 1/16 short scan duration inputs both18F-FDG and68Ga-PSMA radiotracers. Although, quantitatively PSNR, SSIM, and NRMSE of the 1/16 scan duration level were improved more than 1/8 counterparts, however, the later were qualitatively more appealing. SUVmeanand SUVmaxof the generated images were also indicative of the improvements. The cycle-GAN model was much more capable in terms of image quality improvements and speed than the NLM denoising method. All results proved statistically significant using the paired-sample T-Test statistical test (p-value < 0.05).Significance.Our suggested approach based on cycle-GAN could improve image quality of the 1/8 and 1/16 short scan-duration inputs through noise reduction both quantitively (PSNR, SSIM, NRMSE, SUVmean, and SUVmax) and qualitatively (contrast, noise, and diagnostic capability) to the level comparable to the standard scan-duration counterparts. The cycle-GAN model(s) had a similar performance on the68Ga-PSMA to the18F-FDG images and could improve the images qualitatively and quantitatively but requires more extensive study. Overall, images predicted from 1/8 short scan-duration inputs had the upper hand compared with 1/16 short scan-duration inputs.

ABSTRACT:
Objective. Multicentre studies in molecular radiotherapy face challenges in ensuring the comparability of dosimetry results. The aim of this study was to develop a validation protocol to achieve equivalent177Lu-SPECT quantification across centres, consisting of a test exercise in combination with an action level.Approach.177Lu-SPECT/CT imaging of 3D-printed kidney phantoms with non-uniform activity distributions was conducted at five hospitals in Sweden and the UK. In total, 12 quantification systems (QSs) were included, where a QS was defined as the combination of a given camera system, reconstruction method and image-analysis method. The accuracy of image-based estimates of the activity concentration was investigated for three approaches to multicentre dosimetry: one site-specific, and two variants of centralised approaches. For the site-specific approach, the reference value was blinded to the evaluating operators. Prior to the evaluation, the participants agreed on an action level, specified as an obtained deviation larger than ±10% from the reference value. Sites responsible for a QS that yielded larger deviations, and therefore did not comply, were required to present an action plan, i.e., a plan for further method optimisation.Main results. For the site-specific approach, deviations larger than 10% were obtained for six out of 12 QS (range -11% to +27%). Action plans were presented for these QS and was implemented by one site (two QS). For the two variants of centralised approaches, where nine QS were included in total, deviations of within 10% were obtained for nine and seven QS, respectively.Significance. A quantification test combined with an action level can serve as an initial validation to enable further development and to achieve equivalent177Lu-SPECT quantification across sites.

TITLE: A Multiprocessing Scheme for PET Image Pre-Screening, Noise Reduction, Segmentation and Lesion Partitioning

AUTHORS: Runxi Cui, Zhigang Chen, Jia Wu, YanLin Tan, GengHua Yu

JOURNAL: IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Accurate segmentation and partitioning of lesions in PET images provide computer-aided procedures and doctors with parameters for tumour diagnosis, staging and prognosis. Currently, PET segmentation and lesion partitioning are manually measured by radiologists, which is time consuming and laborious, and tedious manual procedures might lead to inaccurate measurement results. Therefore, we designed a new automatic multiprocessing scheme for PET image pre-screening, noise reduction, segmentation and lesion partitioning in this study. PET image pre-screening can reduce the time cost of noise reduction, segmentation and lesion partitioning methods, and denoising can enhance both quantitative metrics and visual quality for better segmentation accuracy. For pre-screening, we propose a new differential activation filter (DAF) to screen the lesion images from whole-body scanning. For noise reduction, neural network inverse (NN inverse) as the inverse transformation of generalized Anscombe transformation (GAT), which does not depend on the distribution of residual noise, was presented to improve the SNR of images. For segmentation and lesion partitioning, definition density peak clustering (DDPC) was proposed to realize instance segmentation of lesion and normal tissue with unsupervised images, which helped reduce the cost of density calculation and completely deleted the cluster halo. The experimental results of clinical data demonstrate that our proposed methods have good results and better performance in noise reduction, segmentation and lesion partitioning compared with state-of-the-art methods.

AUTHORS: Ian L Alberts, Song Xue, Hasan Sari, Lara Cavinato, George Prenosil, Ali Afshar-Oromieh, Clemens Mingels, Kuangyu Shi, Federico Caobelli, Arman Rahmim, Thomas Pyka, Axel Rominger

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: To assess the influence of long-axial field-of-view (LAFOV) PET/CT systems on radiomics feature reliability, to assess the suitability for short-duration or low-activity acquisitions for textural feature analysis and to investigate the influence of acceptance angle.

Methods: 34 patients were analysed: twelve patients underwent oncological 2-[18F]-FDG PET/CT, fourteen [18F]PSMA-1007 and eight [68Ga]Ga-DOTATOC. Data were obtained using a 106 cm LAFOV system for 10 min. Sinograms were generated from list-mode data corresponding to scan durations of 2, 5, 10, 20, 30, 60, 120, 240, 360 and 600s using both standard (minimum ring difference MRD 85 crystals) and maximum acceptance angles (MRD 322). Target lesions were segmented and radiomics features were calculated. To assess feature correlation, Pearson's product-moment correlation coefficient (PPMCC) was calculated with respect to the full duration acquisition for MRD 85 and 322 respectively. The number of features with excellent (r > 0.9), moderate (r > 0.7 and < 0.9) and poor (r ≤ 0.7) correlation was compared as a measure of feature stability. Intra-class heterogeneity was assessed by means of the quartile coefficient of dispersion.

Results: As expected, PPMCC improved with acquisition time for all features. By 240s almost all features showed at least moderate agreement with the full count (C100%) data, and by 360s almost all showed excellent agreement. Compared to standard-axial field of view (SAFOV) equivalent scans, fewer features showed moderate or poor agreement, and this was most pronounced for [68Ga]Ga-DOTATOC. Data obtained at C100% at MRD 322 were better able to capture between-patient heterogeneities.

Conclusion: The improved feature reliability at longer acquisition times and higher MRD demonstrate the advantages of high sensitivity LAFOV systems for reproducible and low-noise data. High fidelity between MRD 85 and MRD 322 was seen at all scan durations > 2s. When contrasted with data comparable to a simulated SAFOV acquisition, full-count and full-MRD data were better able to capture underlying feature heterogeneities.

TITLE: A deep learning method for total-body dynamic PET imaging with dual-time-window protocols

AUTHORS: Wenxiang Ding, Hanzhong Wang, Xiaoya Qiao, Biao Li, Qiu Huang

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Prolonged scanning durations are one of the primary barriers to the widespread clinical adoption of dynamic Positron Emission Tomography (PET). In this paper, we developed a deep learning algorithm that capable of predicting dynamic images from dual-time-window protocols, thereby shortening the scanning time.

Methods: This study includes 70 patients (mean age ± standard deviation, 53.61 ± 13.53 years; 32 males) diagnosed with pulmonary nodules or breast nodules between 2022 to 2024. Each patient underwent a 65-min dynamic total-body [18F]FDG PET/CT scan. Acquisitions using early-stop protocols and dual-time-window protocols were simulated to reduce the scanning time. To predict the missing frames, we developed a bidirectional sequence-to-sequence model with attention mechanism (Bi-AT-Seq2Seq); and then compared the model with unidirectional or non-attentional models in terms of Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Bias, Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), and Structural Similarity (SSIM) of predicted frames. Furthermore, we reported the comparison of concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) of the kinetic parameters between the proposed method and traditional methods.

Results: The Bi-AT-Seq2Seq significantly outperform unidirectional or non-attentional models in terms of MAE, Bias, PSNR, and SSIM. Using a dual-time-window protocol, which includes a 10-min early scan followed by a 5-min late scan, improves the four metrics of predicted dynamic images by 37.31%, 36.24%, 7.10%, and 0.014% respectively, compared to the early-stop protocol with a 15-min acquisition. The CCCs of tumor' kinetic parameters estimated with recovered full time-activity-curves (TACs) is higher than those with abbreviated TACs.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm can accurately generate a complete dynamic acquisition (65 min) from dual-time-window protocols (10 + 5 min).

TITLE: Optimization of scatter estimation window setting for quantitative analysis in 111 In-pentetreotide single photon emission computed tomography imaging

AUTHORS: Mizuho Hishikawa, Norikazu Matsutomo, Tomoaki Yamamoto

JOURNAL: Hellenic journal of nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Objective: The aim of this study was to validate the optimal scatter correction method and scatter estimation window setting in terms of image quality and quantitative accuracy for quantitative indium-111 (111In)-pentetreotide SPECT imaging.

Materials and methods: We used a positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) phantom to validate image quality and quantitative accuracy, and the SPECT images were acquired by the multi-energy window (MEW) method. The scatter estimation was performed using four kinds of energy windows (MEW1, MEW2, MEW3, and MEW4). Scatter correction was also performed using a dual-energy window (DEW) for comparison with MEWs. Image quality was assessed using percent contrast (% contrast) and background variability, and quantitative accuracy was assessed using the mean standardized uptake value (SUVmean) with hot spheres.

Results: In the quantification, all MEW settings approached the theoretical SUVmean (MEW1, 0.99±0.06; MEW2, 0.99±0.05; MEW3, 1.00±0.08; MEW4, 0.97±0.12) in contrast to DEW (0.88±0.05). The SUVmean value for scatter correction of both photopeaks for a 28 mm sphere showed the smallest difference from the theoretical value.

Conclusion: The scatter correction method that gave optimal image quality and quantitative accuracy was MEW3 with two 20% energy windows (one over each photopeak) and four adjacent 3% scatter estimation windows (one on each side of the two photopeaks).

TITLE: Three-branch feature enhancement and fusion network for focal cortical dysplasia lesions segmentation using multimodal imaging

AUTHORS: Manli Zhang, Hao Yu, Gongpeng Cao, Jinguo Huang, Yintao Cheng, Wenjing Zhang, Xiaotong Yuan, Rui Yang, Qiunan Li, Lixin Cai, Guixia Kang

JOURNAL: Brain research bulletin

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Objective: Conventional multimodal imaging, including MRI and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), has difficulty in accurately detecting subtle or blurred focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) lesions. Morphometric maps assist localization by highlighting abnormal regions, whereas wavelet-filtered images emphasize texture and edge details. Therefore, we propose a three-branch feature enhancement and fusion network (TBFEF-Net) that integrates conventional multimodal imaging, morphometric maps, and wavelet-filtered images to enhance the accuracy of FCD localization.

Methods: The proposed TBFEF-Net comprises a semantic segmentation backbone, a cross-branch feature enhancement (CFE) module, and a multi-feature fusion (MFF) module. In the semantic segmentation backbone, three UNet-based branches separately extract semantic features from conventional multimodal imaging, morphometric maps, and wavelet-filtered images. In the encoding stage, the CFE incorporates a residual-based convolutional block attention module (CBAM) to aggregate features from all branches, enhancing the feature representation of FCD lesions. While in the decoding stage, the MFF integrates edge detail features from the wavelet-filtered imaging branch into the conventional multimodal imaging branch, enhancing the ability to capture lesion edges. As a result, this approach enables more precise segmentation.

Results: Experimental results show that TBFEF-Net surpasses several state-of-the-art methods in FCD segmentation. In the primary cohort, the Dice and sensitivity reached 59.73 % and 67.13 %, respectively, while in the open cohort, the Dice and sensitivity were 54.67 % and 54.81 %, respectively.

Significance: We introduced wavelet-filtered images for the first time in FCD segmentation, offering a novel approach and perspective for FCD lesions localization.

TITLE: UR-cycleGAN: Denoising full-body low-dose PET images using cycle-consistent Generative Adversarial Networks

AUTHORS: Yang Liu, ZhiWu Sun, HaoJia Liu

JOURNAL: Journal of applied clinical medical physics

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: This study aims to develop a CycleGAN based denoising model to enhance the quality of low-dose PET (LDPET) images, making them as close as possible to standard-dose PET (SDPET) images.

Methods: Using a Philips Vereos PET/CT system, whole-body PET images of fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) were acquired from 37 patients to facilitate the development of the UR-CycleGAN model. In this model, low-dose data were simulated by reconstructing PET images with a 30-s acquisition time, while standard-dose data were reconstructed from a 2.5-min acquisition. The network was trained in a supervised manner on 13 210 pairs of PET images, and the quality of the images was objectively evaluated using peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index (SSIM).

Results: Compared to simulated low-dose data, the denoised PET images generated by our model showed significant improvement, with a clear trend toward SDPET image quality.

Conclusion: The proposed method reduces acquisition time by 80% compared to standard-dose imaging, while achieving image quality close to SDPET images. It also enhances visual detail fidelity, demonstrating the feasibility and practical utility of the model for significantly reducing imaging time while maintaining high image quality.

TITLE: Leveraging small voxel with optimal acquisition time for [18F]mFBG total-body PET/CT imaging in pediatric patients with neuroblastoma: a preliminary study

AUTHORS: Zhaoting Cheng, Xiaoyun Deng, Shuang Song, Yang Wu, Hongmei Tang, Sijuan Zou, Yuankai Zhu, Aiguo Liu, Xiaohua Zhu

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: The advent of total-body PET/CT presents an opportunity for significant advancements in imaging of neuroblastoma with [18F]meta-fluorobenzylguanidine ([18F]mFBG). Small voxel imaging has proven to have better lesion detectability but need enough radioactivity counts. This study aims to balance shortened acquisition times and small voxel reconstruction to keep sufficient image quality and diagnostic confidence on [18F]mFBG total-body PET for neuroblastoma.

Methods: We retrospectively enrolled 33 pediatric patients with neuroblastoma who underwent 37 [18F]mFBG total-body uEXPLORER PET/CT scans of 10-min duration. PET images were reconstructed with varying acquisition times (0.5-10 min) and three matrix sizes (192 × 192, 512 × 512 and 1024 × 1024). The subjective (scored on a 5-point scale) and objective image quality (signal-to-noise ratio, SNR) of all the sets of reconstructed images were analyzed by nuclear medicine physicians. For indeterminate lesions identified in the group of 192 × 192 matrix with the 10-min scan (G192-10), diagnostic confidence was further evaluated in images reconstructed with the 512 × 512 and 1024 × 1024 matrices (G512 and G1024).

Results: Of the 33 patients with 37 [18F]mFBG PET/CT scans, 17 patients with 20 scans had positive [18F]mFBG PET/CT findings. Sufficient subjective image quality was achieved with at least 2-min acquisition of 192 × 192 matrix and 4-min acquisition of 512 × 512 matrix (with all scores ≥ 3). SNR increased with longer acquisition times for the same voxel size, while decreased as voxel size shrunk. Although the Curie and SIOPEN scores remained consistent across G192, G512, and G1024-10 groups, the G512 groups with at least 2-min acquisition and G1024-10 showed significantly higher confidence scores for characterizing indeterminate lesions on the G192-10 images, with almost all indeterminate lesions being rated as very confident.

Conclusions: A matrix of 512 × 512 with a minimum of 4-min acquisition on [18F]mFBG total-body PET/CT is recommended for sufficient image quality and improved diagnostic confidence, particularly in detecting indeterminate lesions.

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: This study aimed to develop a dedicated phantom using acrylic beads for texture analysis and to represent heterogeneous18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) distributions in various acquisition periods.

Methods: Images of acrylic spherical beads with or without diameters of 5- and 10-mm representing heterogeneous and homogeneous18F-FDG distribution in phantoms, respectively, were collected for 20 min in list mode. Phantom data were reconstructed using three-dimensional ordered subset expectation maximization with attenuation and scatter corrections, and the time-of-flight algorithm. The beads phantom images were acquired twice to evaluate the robustness of texture features. Thirty-one texture features were extracted, and the robustness of texture feature values was evaluated by calculating the percentage of coefficient of variation (%COV) and intraclass coefficient of correlation (ICC). Cross-correlation coefficients among texture feature values were clustered to classify the characteristics of these features.

Results: Heterogeneous18F-FDG distribution was represented by the beads phantom images. The agreements of %COV between two measurements were acceptable (ICC ≥ 0.71). All texture features were classified into four groups. Among 31 texture features, 24 exhibited significant different values between phantoms with and without beads in 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, 20-min image acquisitions. Whereas, the homogeneous and heterogeneous18F-FDG distribution could not be discriminated by seven texture features: low gray-level run emphasis, high gray-level run emphasis, short-run low gray-level emphasis, low gray-level zone emphasis, high gray-level zone emphasis, short-zone low gray-level emphasis, and coarseness.

Conclusions: We have developed the acrylic beads phantom for texture analysis that could represent heterogeneous18F-FDG distributions in various acquisition periods. Most texture features could discriminate homogeneous and heterogeneous18F-FDG distributions in the beads phantom images.

TITLE: PET and MRI image fusion based on a dense convolutional network with dual attention

AUTHORS: Bicao Li, Jenq-Neng Hwang, Zhoufeng Liu, Chunlei Li, Zongmin Wang

JOURNAL: Computers in biology and medicine

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
The fusion techniques of different modalities in medical images, e.g., Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), are increasingly significant in many clinical applications by integrating the complementary information from different medical images. In this paper, we propose a novel fusion model based on a dense convolutional network with dual attention (CSpA-DN) for PET and MRI images. In our framework, an encoder composed of the densely connected neural network is constructed to extract features from source images, and a decoder network is employed to generate the fused image from these features. Simultaneously, a dual-attention module is introduced in the encoder and decoder to further integrate local features along with their global dependencies adaptively. In the dual-attention module, a spatial attention block is leveraged to extract features of each point from encoder network by a weighted sum of feature information at all positions. Meanwhile, the interdependent correlation of all image features is aggregated via a module of channel attention. In addition, we design a specific loss function including image loss, structural loss, gradient loss and perception loss to preserve more structural and detail information and sharpen the edges of targets. Our approach facilitates the fused images to not only preserve abundant functional information from PET images but also retain rich detail structures of MRI images. Experimental results on publicly available datasets illustrate the superiorities of CSpA-DN model compared with state-of-the-art methods according to both qualitative observation and objective assessment.

TITLE: Dynamic chaotic gravitational search algorithm-based kinetic parameter estimation of hepatocellular carcinoma on 18F-FDG PET/CT

AUTHORS: Jianfeng He, Tao Wang, Yongjin Li, Yinglei Deng, Shaobo Wang

JOURNAL: BMC medical imaging

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Background: Kinetic parameters estimated with dynamic18F-FDG PET/CT can help to characterize hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We aim to evaluate the feasibility of the gravitational search algorithm (GSA) for kinetic parameter estimation and to propose a dynamic chaotic gravitational search algorithm (DCGSA) to enhance parameter estimation.

Methods: Five-minute dynamic PET/CT data of 20 HCCs were prospectively enrolled, and the kinetic parameters k1~ k4and the hepatic arterial perfusion index (HPI) were estimated with a dual-input three-compartment model based on nonlinear least squares (NLLS), GSA and DCGSA.

Results: The results showed that there were significant differences between the HCCs and background liver tissues for k1, k4and the HPI of NLLS; k1, k3, k4and the HPI of GSA; and k1, k2, k3, k4and the HPI of DCGSA. DCGSA had a higher diagnostic performance for k3than NLLS and GSA.

Conclusions: GSA enables accurate estimation of the kinetic parameters of dynamic PET/CT in the diagnosis of HCC, and DCGSA can enhance the diagnostic performance.

TITLE: Inpainting the metal artifact region in MRI images by using generative adversarial networks with gated convolution

AUTHORS: Kai Xie, Liugang Gao, Zhengda Lu, Chunying Li, Qianyi Xi, Fan Zhang, Jiawei Sun, Tao Lin, Jianfeng Sui, Xinye Ni

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays an important role in clinical diagnosis, but it is susceptible to metal artifacts. The generative adversarial network GatedConv with gated convolution (GC) and contextual attention (CA) was used to inpaint the metal artifact region in MRI images.

Methods: MRI images containing or near the teeth of 70 patients were collected, and the scanning sequence was a T1-weighted high-resolution isotropic volume examination sequence. A total of 10 000 slices were obtained after data enhancement, of which 8000 slices were used for training. MRI images were normalized to [-1,1]. Based on the randomly generated mask, U-Net, pix2pix, PConv with partial convolution, and GatedConv were used to inpaint the artifact region of MRI images. The mean absolute error (MAE) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) for the mask were used to compare the results of these methods. The inpainting effect on the test dataset using dental masks was also evaluated. Besides, the artifact area of clinical MRI images was inpainted based on the mask sketched by physicians. Finally, the earring artifacts and artifacts caused by abnormal signal foci were inpainted to verify the generalization of the models.

Results: GatedConv could directly and effectively inpaint the incomplete MRI images generated by masks in the image domain. For the results of U-Net, pix2pix, PConv, and GatedConv, the masked MAEs were 0.1638, 0.1812, 0.1688, and 0.1596, respectively, and the masked PSNRs were 18.2136, 17.5692, 18.2258, and 18.3035 dB, respectively. Using dental masks, the results of U-Net, pix2pix, and PConv differed more from the real images in terms of alveolar shape and surrounding tissue compared with GatedConv. GatedConv could inpaint the metal artifact region in clinical MRI images more effectively than the other models, but the increase in the mask area could reduce the inpainting effect. Inpainted MRI images by GatedConv and CT images with metal artifact reduction coincided with alveolar and tissue structure, and GatedConv could successfully inpaint artifacts caused by abnormal signal foci, whereas the other models failed. The ablation study demonstrated that GC and CA increased the reliability of the inpainting performance of GatedConv.

Conclusion: MRI images are affected by metal, and signal void areas appear near metal. GatedConv can inpaint the MRI metal artifact region in the image domain directly and effectively and improve image quality. Medical image inpainting by GatedConv has potential value for tasks, such as positron emission tomography (PET) attenuation correction in PET/MRI and adaptive radiotherapy of synthetic CT based on MRI.

TITLE: Development of a new toolbox for mouse PET-CT brain image analysis fully based on CT images and validation in a PD mouse model

AUTHORS: L Presotto, V Bettinardi, D Mercatelli, M Picchio, M Morari, R M Moresco, Sara Belloli

JOURNAL: Scientific reports

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Automatic analysis toolboxes are popular in brain image analysis, both in clinical and in preclinical practices. In this regard, we proposed a new toolbox for mouse PET-CT brain image analysis including a new Statistical Parametric Mapping-based template and a pipeline for image registration of PET-CT images based on CT images. The new templates is compatible with the common coordinate framework (CCFv3) of the Allen Reference Atlas (ARA) while the CT based registration step allows to facilitate the analysis of mouse PET-CT brain images. From the ARA template, we identified 27 volumes of interest that are relevant for in vivo imaging studies and provided binary atlas to describe them. We acquired 20 C57BL/6 mice with [18F]FDG PET-CT, and 12 of them underwent 3D T2-weighted high-resolution MR scans. All images were elastically registered to the ARA atlas and then averaged. High-resolution MR images were used to validate a CT-based registration pipeline. The resulting method was applied to a mouse model of Parkinson's disease subjected to a test-retest study (n = 6) with the TSPO-specific radioligand [18F]VC701. The identification of regions of microglia/macrophage activation was performed in comparison to the Ma and Mirrione template. The new toolbox identified 11 (6 after false discovery rate adjustment, FDR) brain sub-areas of significant [18F]VC701 uptake increase versus the 4 (3 after FDR) macro-regions identified by the Ma and Mirrione template. Moreover, these 11 areas are functionally connected as found by applying the Mouse Connectivity tool of ARA. In conclusion, we developed a mouse brain atlas tool optimized for PET-CT imaging analysis that does not require MR. This tool conforms to the CCFv3 of ARA and could be applied to the analysis of mouse brain disease models.

TITLE: Self-supervised neural network for Patlak-based parametric imaging in dynamic [18F]FDG total-body PET

AUTHORS: Wenjian Gu, Zhanshi Zhu, Ze Liu, Yihan Wang, Yanxiao Li, Tianyi Xu, Weiping Liu, Gongning Luo, Kuanquan Wang, Yun Zhou

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: The objective of this study is to generate reliable Kiparametric images from a shortened [18F]FDG total-body PET for clinical applications using a self-supervised neural network algorithm.

Methods: We proposed a self-supervised neural network algorithm with Patlak graphical analysis (SN-Patlak) to generate Kiimages from shortened dynamic [18F]FDG PET without 60-min full-dynamic PET-based training. The algorithm deeply integrates neural network architecture with a Patlak method, employing the fitting error of the Patlak plot as the neural network's loss function. As the 0-60 min blood time activity curve (TAC) required by the standard Patlak plot is unobtainable from shortened dynamic PET scans, a population-based "normalized time" (integral-to-instantaneous blood concentration ratio) was used for the linear fitting of Patlak plot of t* to 60 min, and the modified Patlak plot equation was then incorporated into the neural network. Kiimages were generated by minimizing the difference between the input layer (measured tissue-to-blood concentration ratios) and the output layer (predicted tissue-to-blood concentration ratios). The effects of t* (20 to 50 min post injection) on the Kiimages generated from the SN-Patlak and standard Patlak was evaluated using the normalized mean square error (NMSE), and Pearson's correlation coefficient (Pearson's r).

Results: The Kiimages generated by the SN-Patlak are robust to the dynamic PET scan duration, and the Kiimages generated by the SN-Patlak from just a 10-minute (50-60 min post-injection) dynamic [18F]FDG total-body PET scan are comparable to those generated by the standard Patlak method from 40-min (20-60 min post injection) with NMSE = 0.15 ± 0.03 and Pearson's r = 0.93 ± 0.01.

Conclusions: The SN-Patlak parametric imaging algorithm is robust and reliable for quantification of 10-min dynamic [18F]FDG total-body PET.

TITLE: Multi-scale feature similarity-based weakly supervised lymphoma segmentation in PET/CT images

AUTHORS: Zhengshan Huang, Yu Guo, Ning Zhang, Xian Huang, Pierre Decazes, Stephanie Becker, Su Ruan

JOURNAL: Computers in biology and medicine

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Accurate lymphoma segmentation in PET/CT images is important for evaluating Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) prognosis. As systemic multiple lymphomas, DLBCL lesions vary in number and size for different patients, which makes DLBCL labeling labor-intensive and time-consuming. To reduce the reliance on accurately labeled datasets, a weakly supervised deep learning method based on multi-scale feature similarity is proposed for automatic lymphoma segmentation. Weak labeling was performed by randomly dawning a small and salient lymphoma volume for the patient without accurate labels. A 3D V-Net is used as the backbone of the segmentation network and image features extracted in different convolutional layers are fused with the Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) module to generate multi-scale feature representations of input images. By imposing multi-scale feature consistency constraints on the predicted tumor regions as well as the labeled tumor regions, weakly labeled data can also be effectively used for network training. The cosine similarity, which has strong generalization, is exploited here to measure feature distances. The proposed method is evaluated with a PET/CT dataset of 147 lymphoma patients. Experimental results show that when using data, half of which have accurate labels and the other half have weak labels, the proposed method performed similarly to a fully supervised segmentation network and achieved an average Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 71.47%. The proposed method is able to reduce the requirement for expert annotations in deep learning-based lymphoma segmentation.

TITLE: Bidirectional Mapping Generative Adversarial Networks for Brain MR to PET Synthesis

AUTHORS: Shengye Hu, Baiying Lei, Shuqiang Wang, Yong Wang, Zhiguang Feng, Yanyan Shen

JOURNAL: IEEE transactions on medical imaging

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Fusing multi-modality medical images, such as magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and positron emission tomography (PET), can provide various anatomical and functional information about the human body. However, PET data is not always available for several reasons, such as high cost, radiation hazard, and other limitations. This paper proposes a 3D end-to-end synthesis network called Bidirectional Mapping Generative Adversarial Networks (BMGAN). Image contexts and latent vectors are effectively used for brain MR-to-PET synthesis. Specifically, a bidirectional mapping mechanism is designed to embed the semantic information of PET images into the high-dimensional latent space. Moreover, the 3D Dense-UNet generator architecture and the hybrid loss functions are further constructed to improve the visual quality of cross-modality synthetic images. The most appealing part is that the proposed method can synthesize perceptually realistic PET images while preserving the diverse brain structures of different subjects. Experimental results demonstrate that the performance of the proposed method outperforms other competitive methods in terms of quantitative measures, qualitative displays, and evaluation metrics for classification.

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Objective: While the use of biomarkers for the detection of early and preclinical Alzheimer's Disease has become essential, the need to wait for over an hour after injection to obtain sufficient image quality can be challenging for patients with suspected dementia and their caregivers. This study aimed to develop an image-based deep-learning technique to generate delayed uptake patterns of amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) images using only early-phase images obtained from 0-20 min after radiotracer injection.

Methods: We prepared pairs of early and delayed [11C]PiB dynamic images from 253 patients (cognitively normal n = 32, fronto-temporal dementia n = 39, mild cognitive impairment n = 19, Alzheimer's disease n = 163) as a training dataset. The neural network was trained with the early images as the input, and the output was the corresponding delayed image. A U-net convolutional neural network (CNN) and a conditional generative adversarial network (C-GAN) were used for the deep-learning architecture and the data augmentation methods, respectively. Then, an independent test data set consisting of early-phase amyloid PET images (n = 19) was used to generate corresponding delayed images using the trained network. Two nuclear medicine physicians interpreted the actual delayed images and predicted delayed images for amyloid positivity. In addition, the concordance of the actual delayed and predicted delayed images was assessed statistically.

Results: The concordance of amyloid positivity between the actual versus AI-predicted delayed images was 79%(κ = 0.60) and 79% (κ = 0.59) for each physician, respectively. In addition, the physicians' agreement rate was at 89% (κ = 0.79) when the same image was interpreted. And, the actual versus AI-predicted delayed images were not readily distinguishable (correct answer rate, 55% and 47% for each physician, respectively). The statistical comparison of the actual versus the predicted delated images indicated that the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) was 21.8 dB ± 2.2 dB, and the structural similarity index (SSIM) was 0.45 ± 0.04.

Conclusion: This study demonstrates the feasibility of an image-based deep-learning framework to predict delayed patterns of Amyloid PET uptake using only the early phase images. This AI-based image generation method has the potential to reduce scan time for amyloid PET and increase the patient throughput, without sacrificing diagnostic accuracy for amyloid positivity.

TITLE: Automated Measurement of Effective Radiation Dose by 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography

AUTHORS: Yujin Eom, Yong-Jin Park, Sumin Lee, Su-Jin Lee, Young-Sil An, Bok-Nam Park, Joon-Kee Yoon

JOURNAL: Tomography (Ann Arbor, Mich.)

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Background/objectives: Calculating the radiation dose from CT in18F-PET/CT examinations poses a significant challenge. The objective of this study is to develop a deep learning-based automated program that standardizes the measurement of radiation doses.

Methods: The torso CT was segmented into six distinct regions using TotalSegmentator. An automated program was employed to extract the necessary information and calculate the effective dose (ED) of PET/CT. The accuracy of our automated program was verified by comparing the EDs calculated by the program with those determined by a nuclear medicine physician (n = 30). Additionally, we compared the EDs obtained from an older PET/CT scanner with those from a newer PET/CT scanner (n = 42).

Results: The CT ED calculated by the automated program was not significantly different from that calculated by the nuclear medicine physician (3.67 ± 0.61 mSv and 3.62 ± 0.60 mSv, respectively,p= 0.7623). Similarly, the total ED showed no significant difference between the two calculation methods (8.10 ± 1.40 mSv and 8.05 ± 1.39 mSv, respectively,p= 0.8957). A very strong correlation was observed in both the CT ED and total ED between the two measurements (r2= 0.9981 and 0.9996, respectively). The automated program showed excellent repeatability and reproducibility. When comparing the older and newer PET/CT scanners, the PET ED was significantly lower in the newer scanner than in the older scanner (4.39 ± 0.91 mSv and 6.00 ± 1.17 mSv, respectively,p< 0.0001). Consequently, the total ED was significantly lower in the newer scanner than in the older scanner (8.22 ± 1.53 mSv and 9.65 ± 1.34 mSv, respectively,p< 0.0001).

Conclusions: We successfully developed an automated program for calculating the ED of torso18F-PET/CT. By integrating a deep learning model, the program effectively eliminated inter-operator variability.

TITLE: Enhancing clinical diagnostics: novel denoising methodology for brain MRI with adaptive masking and modified non-local block

AUTHORS: A Velayudham, K Madhan Kumar, Krishna Priya M S

JOURNAL: Medical & biological engineering & computing

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Medical image denoising has been a subject of extensive research, with various techniques employed to enhance image quality and facilitate more accurate diagnostics. The evolution of denoising methods has highlighted impressive results but struggled to strike equilibrium between noise reduction and edge preservation which limits its applicability in various domains. This paper manifests the novel methodology that integrates an adaptive masking strategy, transformer-based U-Net Prior generator, edge enhancement module, and modified non-local block (MNLB) for denoising brain MRI clinical images. The adaptive masking strategy maintains the vital information through dynamic mask generation while the prior generator by capturing hierarchical features regenerates the high-quality prior MRI images. Finally, these images are fed to the edge enhancement module to boost structural information by maintaining crucial edge details, and the MNLB produces the denoised output by deriving non-local contextual information. The comprehensive experimental assessment is performed by employing two datasets namely the brain tumor MRI dataset and Alzheimer's dataset for diverse metrics and compared with conventional denoising approaches. The proposed denoising methodology achieves a PSNR of 40.965 and SSIM of 0.938 on the Alzheimer's dataset and also achieves a PSNR of 40.002 and SSIM of 0.926 on the brain tumor MRI dataset at a noise level of 50% revealing its supremacy in noise minimization. Furthermore, the impact of different masking ratios on denoising performance is analyzed which reveals that the proposed method showed PSNR of 40.965, SSIM of 0.938, MAE of 5.847, and MSE of 3.672 at the masking ratio of 60%. Moreover, the findings pave the way for the advancement of clinical image processing, facilitating precise detection of tumors in clinical MRI images.

TITLE: Performance Evaluation of a Deep Learning System for Differential Diagnosis of Lung Cancer With Conventional CT and FDG PET/CT Using Transfer Learning and Metadata

AUTHORS: Yong-Jin Park, Dongmin Choi, Joon Young Choi, Seung Hyup Hyun

JOURNAL: Clinical nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: We aimed to evaluate the performance of a deep learning system for differential diagnosis of lung cancer with conventional CT and FDG PET/CT using transfer learning (TL) and metadata.

Methods: A total of 359 patients with a lung mass or nodule who underwent noncontrast chest CT and FDG PET/CT prior to treatment were enrolled retrospectively. All pulmonary lesions were classified by pathology (257 malignant, 102 benign). Deep learning classification models based on ResNet-18 were developed using the pretrained weights obtained from ImageNet data set. We propose a deep TL model for differential diagnosis of lung cancer using CT imaging data and metadata with SUVmax and lesion size derived from PET/CT. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of the deep learning model was measured as a performance metric and verified by 5-fold cross-validation.

Results: The performance metrics of the conventional CT model were generally better than those of the CT of PET/CT model. Introducing metadata with SUVmax and lesion size derived from PET/CT into baseline CT models improved the diagnostic performance of the CT of PET/CT model (AUC = 0.837 vs 0.762) and the conventional CT model (AUC = 0.877 vs 0.817).

Conclusions: Deep TL models with CT imaging data provide good diagnostic performance for lung cancer, and the conventional CT model showed overall better performance than the CT of PET/CT model. Metadata information derived from PET/CT can improve the performance of deep learning systems.

TITLE: Radiomics in radiation oncology-basics, methods, and limitations

AUTHORS: Philipp Lohmann, Khaled Bousabarah, Mauritius Hoevels, Harald Treuer

JOURNAL: Strahlentherapie und Onkologie : Organ der Deutschen Rontgengesellschaft ... [et al]

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Over the past years, the quantity and complexity of imaging data available for the clinical management of patients with solid tumors has increased substantially. Without the support of methods from the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, a complete evaluation of the available image information is hardly feasible in clinical routine. Especially in radiotherapy planning, manual detection and segmentation of lesions is laborious, time consuming, and shows significant variability among observers. Here, AI already offers techniques to support radiation oncologists, whereby ultimately, the productivity and the quality are increased, potentially leading to an improved patient outcome. Besides detection and segmentation of lesions, AI allows the extraction of a vast number of quantitative imaging features from structural or functional imaging data that are typically not accessible by means of human perception. These features can be used alone or in combination with other clinical parameters to generate mathematical models that allow, for example, prediction of the response to radiotherapy. Within the large field of AI, radiomics is the subdiscipline that deals with the extraction of quantitative image features as well as the generation of predictive or prognostic mathematical models. This review gives an overview of the basics, methods, and limitations of radiomics, with a focus on patients with brain tumors treated by radiation therapy.

AUTHORS: Kyobin Choo, Jaehoon Joo, Sangwon Lee, Daesung Kim, Hyunkeong Lim, Dongwoo Kim, Seongjin Kang, Seong Jae Hwang, Mijin Yun

JOURNAL: Clinical nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: This study aimed to develop a deep learning (DL) model for brain region parcellation using CT data from PET/CT scans to enable accurate amyloid quantification in 18 F-FBB PET/CT without relying on high-resolution MRI.

Patients and methods: A retrospective dataset of PET/CT and T1-weighted MRI pairs from 226 individuals (157 with mild cognitive impairment or dementia and 69 healthy controls) was used. The dataset was split into training/validation (60%) and test (40%) sets. Utilizing auto-generated segmentation labels, 3 UNets were independently trained for multiplanar brain parcellation on CT and subsequently ensembled. Amyloid load was measured across 46 volumes of interest (VOIs), derived from the Desikan-Killiany-Tourville atlas. Dice similarity coefficient between the proposed CT-based DL model and MRI-based (FreeSurfer) method was calculated, with SUVR comparison using linear regression analysis and intraclass correlation coefficient. Global SUVRs were also compared within groups with clinical dementia ratings (CDRs) of 0, 0.5, and 1.

Results: The DL-based CT parcellation achieved mean Dice similarity coefficients of 0.80 for all 46 VOIs, 0.72 for 16 cortical and limbic VOIs, and 0.83 for 30 subcortical VOIs. For regional and global SUVR comparisons, the linear regression yielded a slope, y-intercept, and R2 of 1 ± 0.027, 0 ± 0.040, and ≧0.976, respectively ( P < 0.001), and the intraclass correlation coefficient was ≧0.988 ( P < 0.001). For global SUVRs in each CDR group, these values were 1 ± 0.020, 0 ± 0.026, ≧0.993, and ≧0.996, respectively ( P < 0.001). Both MRI-based and CT-based global SUVR showed a consistent increase as the CDR score increased.

Conclusions: The DL-based CT parcellation agrees strongly with MRI-based methods for amyloid PET quantification.

TITLE: BAF-Net: bidirectional attention-aware fluid pyramid feature integrated multimodal fusion network for diagnosis and prognosis

AUTHORS: Huiqin Wu, Lihong Peng, Dongyang Du, Hui Xu, Guoyu Lin, Zidong Zhou, Lijun Lu, Wenbing Lv

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Objective. To go beyond the deficiencies of the three conventional multimodal fusion strategies (i.e. input-, feature- and output-level fusion), we propose a bidirectional attention-aware fluid pyramid feature integrated fusion network (BAF-Net) with cross-modal interactions for multimodal medical image diagnosis and prognosis.Approach. BAF-Net is composed of two identical branches to preserve the unimodal features and one bidirectional attention-aware distillation stream to progressively assimilate cross-modal complements and to learn supplementary features in both bottom-up and top-down processes. Fluid pyramid connections were adopted to integrate the hierarchical features at different levels of the network, and channel-wise attention modules were exploited to mitigate cross-modal cross-level incompatibility. Furthermore, depth-wise separable convolution was introduced to fuse the cross-modal cross-level features to alleviate the increase in parameters to a great extent. The generalization abilities of BAF-Net were evaluated in terms of two clinical tasks: (1) an in-house PET-CT dataset with 174 patients for differentiation between lung cancer and pulmonary tuberculosis. (2) A public multicenter PET-CT head and neck cancer dataset with 800 patients from nine centers for overall survival prediction.Main results. On the LC-PTB dataset, improved performance was found in BAF-Net (AUC = 0.7342) compared with input-level fusion model (AUC = 0.6825;p< 0.05), feature-level fusion model (AUC = 0.6968;p= 0.0547), output-level fusion model (AUC = 0.7011;p< 0.05). On the H&N cancer dataset, BAF-Net (C-index = 0.7241) outperformed the input-, feature-, and output-level fusion model, with 2.95%, 3.77%, and 1.52% increments of C-index (p= 0.3336, 0.0479 and 0.2911, respectively). The ablation experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of all the designed modules regarding all the evaluated metrics in both datasets.Significance. Extensive experiments on two datasets demonstrated better performance and robustness of BAF-Net than three conventional fusion strategies and PET or CT unimodal network in terms of diagnosis and prognosis.

ABSTRACT:
Background: Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET/CT imaging is widely used for quantitative image analysis, especially in radioligand therapy (RLT) for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Unknown features influencing PSMA biodistribution can be explored by analyzing segmented organs at risk (OAR) and lesions. Manual segmentation is time-consuming and labor-intensive, so automated segmentation methods are desirable. Training deep-learning segmentation models is challenging due to the scarcity of high-quality annotated images. Addressing this, we developed shifted windows UNEt TRansformers (Swin UNETR) for fully automated segmentation. Within a self-supervised framework, the model's encoder was pre-trained on unlabeled data. The entire model was fine-tuned, including its decoder, using labeled data.

Methods: In this work, 752 whole-body [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT images were collected from two centers. For self-supervised model pre-training, 652 unlabeled images were employed. The remaining 100 images were manually labeled for supervised training. In the supervised training phase, 5-fold cross-validation was used with 64 images for model training and 16 for validation, from one center. For testing, 20 hold-out images, evenly distributed between two centers, were used. Image segmentation and quantification metrics were evaluated on the test set compared to the ground-truth segmentation conducted by a nuclear medicine physician.

Results: The model generates high-quality OARs and lesion segmentation in lesion-positive cases, including mCRPC. The results show that self-supervised pre-training significantly improved the average dice similarity coefficient (DSC) for all classes by about 3%. Compared to nnU-Net, a well-established model in medical image segmentation, our approach outperformed with a 5% higher DSC. This improvement was attributed to our model's combined use of self-supervised pre-training and supervised fine-tuning, specifically when applied to PET/CT input. Our best model had the lowest DSC for lesions at 0.68 and the highest for liver at 0.95.

Conclusions: We developed a state-of-the-art neural network using self-supervised pre-training on whole-body [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT images, followed by fine-tuning on a limited set of annotated images. The model generates high-quality OARs and lesion segmentation for PSMA image analysis. The generalizable model holds potential for various clinical applications, including enhanced RLT and patient-specific internal dosimetry.

TITLE: Automatic medical imaging segmentation via self-supervising large-scale convolutional neural networks

AUTHORS: Yuheng Li, Jacob F Wynne, Yizhou Wu, Richard L J Qiu, Sibo Tian, Tonghe Wang, Pretesh R Patel, David S Yu, Xiaofeng Yang

JOURNAL: Radiotherapy and oncology : journal of the European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: This study aims to develop a robust, large-scale deep learning model for medical image segmentation, leveraging self-supervised learning to overcome the limitations of supervised learning and data variability in clinical settings.

Methods and materials: We curated a substantial multi-center CT dataset for self-supervised pre-training using masked image modeling with sparse submanifold convolution. We designed a series of Sparse Submanifold U-Nets (SS-UNets) of varying sizes and performed self-supervised pre-training. We fine-tuned the SS-UNets on the TotalSegmentator dataset. The evaluation encompassed robustness tests on four unseen datasets and transferability assessments on three additional datasets.

Results: Our SS-UNets exhibited superior performance in comparison to state-of-the-art self-supervised methods, demonstrating higher Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and Surface Dice Coefficient (SDC) metrics. SS-UNet-B achieved 84.3 % DSC and 88.0 % SDC in TotalSegmentator. We further demonstrated the scalability of our networks, with segmentation performance increasing with model size, demonstrated from 58 million to 1.4 billion parameters:4.6 % DSC and 3.2 % SDC improvement in TotalSegmentator from SS-UNet-B to SS-UNet-H.

Conclusions: We demonstrate the efficacy of self-supervised learning for medical image segmentation in the CT, MRI and PET domains. Our approach significantly reduces reliance on extensively labeled data, mitigates risks of overfitting, and enhances model generalizability. Future applications may allow accurate segmentation of organs and lesions across several imaging domains, potentially streamlining cancer detection and radiotherapy treatment planning.

TITLE: Automated quantification of brain PET in PET/CT using deep learning-based CT-to-MR translation: a feasibility study

AUTHORS: Daesung Kim, Kyobin Choo, Sangwon Lee, Seongjin Kang, Mijin Yun, Jaewon Yang

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Quantitative analysis of PET images in brain PET/CT relies on MRI-derived regions of interest (ROIs). However, the pairs of PET/CT and MR images are not always available, and their alignment is challenging if their acquisition times differ considerably. To address these problems, this study proposes a deep learning framework for translating CT of PET/CT to synthetic MR images (MRSYN) and performing automated quantitative regional analysis using MRSYN-derived segmentation.

Methods: In this retrospective study, 139 subjects who underwent brain [18F]FBB PET/CT and T1-weighted MRI were included. A U-Net-like model was trained to translate CT images to MRSYN; subsequently, a separate model was trained to segment MRSYNinto 95 regions. Regional and composite standardised uptake value ratio (SUVr) was calculated in [18F]FBB PET images using the acquired ROIs. For evaluation of MRSYN, quantitative measurements including structural similarity index measure (SSIM) were employed, while for MRSYN-based segmentation evaluation, Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) was calculated. Wilcoxon signed-rank test was performed for SUVrs computed using MRSYNand ground-truth MR (MRGT).

Results: Compared to MRGT, the mean SSIM of MRSYNwas 0.974 ± 0.005. The MRSYN-based segmentation achieved a mean DSC of 0.733 across 95 regions. No statistical significance (P > 0.05) was found for SUVr between the ROIs from MRSYNand those from MRGT, excluding the precuneus.

Conclusion: We demonstrated a deep learning framework for automated regional brain analysis in PET/CT with MRSYN. Our proposed framework can benefit patients who have difficulties in performing an MRI scan.

TITLE: Photon quantum entanglement in the MeV regime and its application in PET imaging

AUTHORS: D P Watts, J Bordes, J R Brown, A Cherlin, R Newton, J Allison, M Bashkanov, N Efthimiou, N A Zachariou

JOURNAL: Nature communications

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a widely-used imaging modality for medical research and clinical diagnosis. Imaging of the radiotracer is obtained from the detected hit positions of the two positron annihilation photons in a detector array. The image is degraded by backgrounds from random coincidences and in-patient scatter events which require correction. In addition to the geometric information, the two annihilation photons are predicted to be produced in a quantum-entangled state, resulting in enhanced correlations between their subsequent interaction processes. To explore this, the predicted entanglement in linear polarisation for the two photons was incorporated into a simulation and tested by comparison with experimental data from a cadmium zinc telluride (CZT) PET demonstrator apparatus. Adapted apparati also enabled correlation measurements where one of the photons had undergone a prior scatter process. We show that the entangled simulation describes the measured correlations and, through simulation of a larger preclinical PET scanner, illustrate a simple method to quantify and remove the unwanted backgrounds in PET using the quantum entanglement information alone.

TITLE: Dose reduction in dynamic synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A PET imaging using artificial neural networks

AUTHORS: Andi Li, Bao Yang, Mika Naganawa, Kathryn Fontaine, Takuya Toyonaga, Richard E Carson, Jing Tang

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Objective. Reducing dose in positron emission tomography (PET) imaging increases noise in reconstructed dynamic frames, which inevitably results in higher noise and possible bias in subsequently estimated images of kinetic parameters than those estimated in the standard dose case. We report the development of a spatiotemporal denoising technique for reduced-count dynamic frames through integrating a cascade artificial neural network (ANN) with the highly constrained back-projection (HYPR) scheme to improve low-dose parametric imaging.Approach. We implemented and assessed the proposed method using imaging data acquired with11C-UCB-J, a PET radioligand bound to synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A) in the human brain. The patch-based ANN was trained with a reduced-count frame and its full-count correspondence of a subject and was used in cascade to process dynamic frames of other subjects to further take advantage of its denoising capability. The HYPR strategy was then applied to the spatial ANN processed image frames to make use of the temporal information from the entire dynamic scan.Main results. In all the testing subjects including healthy volunteers and Parkinson's disease patients, the proposed method reduced more noise while introducing minimal bias in dynamic frames and the resulting parametric images, as compared with conventional denoising methods.Significance. Achieving 80% noise reduction with a bias of -2% in dynamic frames, which translates into 75% and 70% of noise reduction in the tracer uptake (bias, -2%) and distribution volume (bias, -5%) images, the proposed ANN+HYPR technique demonstrates the denoising capability equivalent to a 11-fold dose increase for dynamic SV2A PET imaging with11C-UCB-J.

TITLE: Time-series atlases of the rat brain after middle cerebral artery occlusion using FDG-PET images

JOURNAL: Computers in biology and medicine

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
The middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) procedure is widely used in ischemic stroke research. When using functional 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) images to study ischemic stroke, the difficulty in determining the region of interest (ROI) comes from two aspects: the large variations due to differences in uptake and reaction time and the consistency of different intensity normalization methods among subjects. Using the rat as a model animal, we propose time-series atlases of ischemic stroke after MCAO based on the PET images to annotate changes in ROIs. Concretely, we spatially align serial scans with a built PET template, use histograms of orientated gradient (HOG) features to detect lesion boundaries, and combine them with results from an intensity-based detection method to construct probability maps at different time points with the Bernoulli mixture model (BMM). Simulated PET images with known ground truth and triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining slices validate the correctness of the time-series atlases. We demonstrate that these atlases could provide references when tracking the spatial-temporal dynamic development of lesions in rat brains.

TITLE: Whole-body tumor segmentation from PET/CT images using a two-stage cascaded neural network with camouflaged object detection mechanisms

AUTHORS: Jiangping He, Yangjie Zhang, Maggie Chung, Michael Wang, Kun Wang, Yan Ma, Xiaoyang Ding, Qiang Li, Yonglin Pu

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Background: Whole-body Metabolic Tumor Volume (MTVwb) is an independent prognostic factor for overall survival in lung cancer patients. Automatic segmentation methods have been proposed for MTV calculation. Nevertheless, most of existing methods for patients with lung cancer only segment tumors in the thoracic region.

Purpose: In this paper, we present a Two-Stage cascaded neural network integrated with Camouflaged Object Detection mEchanisms (TS-Code-Net) for automatic segmenting tumors from whole-body PET/CT images.

Methods: Firstly, tumors are detected from the Maximum Intensity Projection (MIP) images of PET/CT scans, and tumors' approximate localizations along z-axis are identified. Secondly, the segmentations are performed on PET/CT slices that contain tumors identified by the first step. Camouflaged object detection mechanisms are utilized to distinguish the tumors from their surrounding regions that have similar Standard Uptake Values (SUV) and texture appearance. Finally, the TS-Code-Net is trained by minimizing the total loss that incorporates the segmentation accuracy loss and the class imbalance loss.

Results: The performance of the TS-Code-Net is tested on a whole-body PET/CT image data-set including 480 Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) patients with five-fold cross-validation using image segmentation metrics. Our method achieves 0.70, 0.76, and 0.70, for Dice, Sensitivity and Precision, respectively, which demonstrates the superiority of the TS-Code-Net over several existing methods related to metastatic lung cancer segmentation from whole-body PET/CT images.

Conclusions: The proposed TS-Code-Net is effective for whole-body tumor segmentation of PET/CT images. Codes for TS-Code-Net are available at: https://github.com/zyj19/TS-Code-Net.

TITLE: Feasibility of Ultra-Low-Activity 18F-FDG PET/CT Imaging Using a Long-Axial-Field-of-View PET/CT System

AUTHORS: Charlotte L C Smith, Gerben J C Zwezerijnen, Marijke E den Hollander, Josée M Zijlstra, C Willemien Menke-van der Houven van Oordt, Idris Bahce, Maqsood Yaqub, Ronald Boellaard

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
18F-FDG PET/CT imaging is widely used in oncology. Long-axial-field-of-view (LAFOV) PET/CT systems exhibit ultrahigh sensitivity and signal-to-noise ratios, enabling significant reductions in tracer activity and shorter acquisition times. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of using ultralow activities for semiquantitative measurements in18F-FDG PET/CT imaging performed on an LAFOV PET/CT system through a high-low activity test-retest study.Methods:Eleven oncology patients underwent 218F-FDG PET/CT scans, the first with standard activity (3.0 MBq/kg) and, within 7 d, 1 with ultralow activity (0.3 MBq/kg). List-mode data of both scans were resampled to simulate activities of 0.3 and 0.03 MBq/kg. Semiquantitative measurements (SUVmean, SUVpeak, and SUVmax) and their repeatability in healthy organs and lesions were compared across different activities and reconstruction protocols.Results:SUVmeanremained stable across activity reductions and reconstruction protocols, whereas SUVpeakshowed stability except when simulating 1% of the standard18F-FDG activity. SUVmaxsignificantly increased at lower18F-FDG activities, particularly with clinically preferred scans. Repeatability analysis showed that SUVmeanand SUVpeakmaintained variability within acceptable limits (<15%) even at 0.03 MBq/kg, whereas SUVmaxvariability often exceeded these limits. Lesion detection was reliable at 0.3 MBq/kg, but several lesions could not be delineated at 0.03 MBq/kg, indicating compromised image quality.Conclusion:The use of ultralow18F-FDG activity (0.3 MBq/kg) is feasible for PET/CT imaging on an LAFOV PET/CT system, as shown by semiquantitative measurements, repeatability analyses, lesion detectability, and semiautomated delineation methods. These findings support imaging protocols that keep radiation exposure levels as low as reasonably or practically achievable, which are particularly relevant for radiation-sensitive patients (e.g., children, pregnant women).

ABSTRACT:
Fibroblast activation protein is a promising target for oncologic molecular imaging with radiolabeled fibroblast activation protein inhibitors (FAPI) in a large variety of cancers. However, there are yet no published recommendations on how to set up an optimal imaging protocol for FAPI PET/CT. It is important to optimize the acquisition duration and strive toward an acquisition that is sufficiently short while simultaneously providing sufficient image quality to ensure a reliable diagnosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of reducing the acquisition duration of [68Ga]FAPI-46 imaging while maintaining satisfactory image quality, with certainty that the radiologist's ability to make a clinical diagnosis would not be affected.Methods:[68Ga]FAPI-46 PET/CT imaging was performed on 10 patients scheduled for surgical resection of suspected pancreatic cancer, 60 min after administration of 3.6 ± 0.2 MBq/kg. The acquisition time was 4 min/bed position, and the raw PET data were statistically truncated and reconstructed to represent images with an acquisition duration of 1, 2, and 3 min/bed position, additional to the reference images of 4 min/bed position. Four image quality criteria that focused on the ability to distinguish specific anatomic details, as well as perceived image noise and overall image quality, were scored on a 4-point Likert scale and analyzed with mixed-effects ordinal logistic regression.Results:A trend toward increasing image quality scores with increasing acquisition duration was observed for all criteria. For the overall image quality, there was no significant difference between 3 and 4 min/bed position, whereas 1 and 2 min/bed position were rated significantly (P< 0.05) lower than 4 min/bed position. For the other criteria, all images with a reduced acquisition duration were rated significantly inferior to images obtained at 4 min/bed position.Conclusion:The acquisition duration can be reduced from 4 to 3 min/bed position while maintaining satisfactory image quality. Reducing the acquisition duration to 2 min/bed position or lower is not recommended since it results in inferior-quality images so noisy that clinical interpretation is significantly disrupted.

TITLE: Stages prediction of Alzheimer's disease with shallow 2D and 3D CNNs from intelligently selected neuroimaging data

JOURNAL: Scientific reports

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Detection of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is critical for successful diagnosis and treatment, involving the common practice of screening for Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). However, the progressive nature of AD makes it challenging to identify its causal factors. Modern diagnostic workflows for AD use cognitive tests, neurological examinations, and biomarker-based methods, e.g., cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis and positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. While these methods are effective, non-invasive imaging techniques like Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) are gaining importance. Deep Learning (DL) approaches for evaluating alterations in brain structure have focused on combining MRI and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) within the spatial architecture of DL. This combination has garnered significant research interest due to its remarkable effectiveness in automating feature extraction across various multilayer perceptron models. Despite this, MRI's noisy and multidimensional nature requires an intelligent preprocessing pipeline for effective disease prediction. Our study aims to detect different stages of AD from the multidimensional neuroimaging data obtained through MRI scans using 2D and 3D CNN architectures. The proposed preprocessing pipeline comprises skull stripping, spatial normalization, and smoothing. It is followed by a novel and efficient pixel count-based frame selection and cropping approach, which renders a notable dimension reduction. Furthermore, the learnable resizer method is applied to enhance the image quality while resizing the data. Finally, the proposed shallow 2D and 3D CNN architectures extract spatio-temporal attributes from the segmented MRI data. Furthermore, we merged both the CNNs for further comparative analysis. Notably, 2D CNN achieved a maximum accuracy of 93%, while 3D CNN reported the highest accuracy of 96.5%.

JOURNAL: Medical & biological engineering & computing

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Medical imaging, also known as radiology, is the field of medicine in which medical professionals recreate various images of parts of the body for diagnostic or treatment purposes. Medical imaging procedures include non-invasive tests that allow doctors to diagnose injuries and diseases without being intrusive TechTarget (n.d.). A number of tools and techniques are used to automate the analysis of medical images acquired with various image processing methods. The brain is one of the largest and most complex organs of the human body and anomaly detection from brain images (i.e., MRI, CT, PET, etc.) is one of the major research areas of medical image analysis. Image processing methods such as filtering and thresholding models, geometry models, graph models, region-based analysis, connected component analysis, machine learning (ML) models, the recent deep learning (DL) models, and various hybrid models are used in brain image analysis. Brain tumors are one of the most common brain diseases with a high mortality rate, and it is difficult to analyze from brain images for the versatility of the shape, location, size, texture, and other characteristics. In this paper, a comprehensive review on brain tumor image analysis is presented with basic ideas of brain tumor, brain imaging, brain image analysis tasks, brain image analysis models, brain tumor image features, performance metrics used for evaluating the models, and some available datasets on brain tumor/medical images. Some challenges of brain tumor analysis are also discussed including suggestions for future research directions. The graphical abstract summarizes the contributions of this paper.

TITLE: Radiomics and Digital Image Texture Analysis in Oncology (Review)

AUTHORS: A A Litvin, D A Burkin, A A Kropinov, F N Paramzin

JOURNAL: Sovremennye tekhnologii v meditsine

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
One of the most promising areas of diagnosis and prognosis of diseases is radiomics, a science combining radiology, mathematical modeling, and deep machine learning. The main concept of radiomics is image biomarkers (IBMs), the parameters characterizing various pathological changes and calculated based on the analysis of digital image texture. IBMs are used for quantitative assessment of digital imaging results (CT, MRI, ultrasound, PET). The use of IBMs in the form of "virtual biopsy" is of particular relevance in oncology. The article provides the basic concepts of radiomics identifying the main stages of obtaining IBMs: data collection and preprocessing, tumor segmentation, data detection and extraction, modeling, statistical processing, and data validation. The authors have analyzed the possibilities of using IBMs in oncology, describing the currently known features and advantages of using radiomics and image texture analysis in the diagnosis and prognosis of cancer. The limitations and problems associated with the use of radiomics data are considered. Although the novel effective tool for performing virtual biopsy of human tissue is at the development stage, quite a few projects have already been implemented, and medical software packages for radiomics analysis of digital images have been created.

TITLE: Transforming UTE-mDixon MR Abdomen-Pelvis Images Into CT by Jointly Leveraging Prior Knowledge and Partial Supervision

ABSTRACT:
Computed tomography (CT) provides information for diagnosis, PET attenuation correction (AC), and radiation treatment planning (RTP). Disadvantages of CT include poor soft tissue contrast and exposure to ionizing radiation. While MRI can overcome these disadvantages, it lacks the photon absorption information needed for PET AC and RTP. Thus, an intelligent transformation from MR to CT, i.e., the MR-based synthetic CT generation, is of great interest as it would support PET/MR AC and MR-only RTP. Using an MR pulse sequence that combines ultra-short echo time (UTE) and modified Dixon (mDixon), we propose a novel method for synthetic CT generation jointly leveraging prior knowledge as well as partial supervision (SCT-PK-PS for short) on large-field-of-view images that span abdomen and pelvis. Two key machine learning techniques, i.e., the knowledge-leveraged transfer fuzzy c-means (KL-TFCM) and the Laplacian support vector machine (LapSVM), are used in SCT-PK-PS. The significance of our effort is threefold: 1) Using the prior knowledge-referenced KL-TFCM clustering, SCT-PK-PS is able to group the feature data of MR images into five initial clusters of fat, soft tissue, air, bone, and bone marrow. Via these initial partitions, clusters needing to be refined are observed and for each of them a few additionally labeled examples are given as the partial supervision for the subsequent semi-supervised classification using LapSVM; 2) Partial supervision is usually insufficient for conventional algorithms to learn the insightful classifier. Instead, exploiting not only the given supervision but also the manifold structure embedded primarily in numerous unlabeled data, LapSVM is capable of training multiple desired tissue-recognizers; 3) Benefiting from the joint use of KL-TFCM and LapSVM, and assisted by the edge detector filter based feature extraction, the proposed SCT-PK-PS method features good recognition accuracy of tissue types, which ultimately facilitates the good transformation from MR images to CT images of the abdomen-pelvis. Applying the method on twenty subjects' feature data of UTE-mDixon MR images, the average score of the mean absolute prediction deviation (MAPD) of all subjects is 140.72 ± 30.60 HU which is statistically significantly better than the 241.36 ± 21.79 HU obtained using the all-water method, the 262.77 ± 42.22 HU obtained using the four-cluster-partitioning (FCP, i.e., external-air, internal-air, fat, and soft tissue) method, and the 197.05 ± 76.53 HU obtained via the conventional SVM method. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for the intelligent transformation from MR to CT on the body section of abdomen-pelvis.

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: We aimed to investigate whether a clinically feasible dual time-point (DTP) approach can accurately estimate the metabolic uptake rate constant (Ki) and to explore reliable acquisition times through simulations and clinical assessment considering patient comfort and quantification accuracy.

Methods: We simulated uptake kinetics in different tumors for four sets of DTP PET images within the routine clinical static acquisition at 60-min post-injection (p.i.). We determined Kifor a total of 81 lesions. Kiquantification from full dynamic PET data (Patlak-Ki) and Kifrom DTP (DTP-Ki) were compared. In addition, we scaled a population-based input function (PBIFscl) with the image-derived blood pool activity sampled at different time points to assess the best scaling time-point for Kiquantifications in the simulation data.

Results: In the simulation study, Kiestimated using DTP via (30,60-min), (30,90-min), (60,90-min), and (60,120-min) samples showed strong correlations (r ≥ 0.944, P < 0.0001) with the true value of Ki. The DTP results with the PBIFsclat 60-min time-point in (30,60-min), (60,90-min), and (60,120-min) were linearly related to the true Kiwith a slope of 1.037, 1.008, 1.013 and intercept of -6 × 10-4, 2 × 10-5, 5 × 10-5, respectively. In a clinical study, strong correlations (r ≥ 0.833, P < 0.0001) were observed between Patlak-Kiand DTP-Ki. The Patlak-derived mean values of Ki, tumor-to-background-ratio, signal-to-noise-ratio, and contrast-to-noise-ratio were linearly correlated with the DTP method.

Conclusions: Besides calculating the retention index as a commonly used quantification parameter inDTP imaging,our DTP method can accurately estimate Ki.

TITLE: Systematic evaluation of human soft tissue attenuation correction in whole-body PET/MR: Implications from PET/CT for optimization of MR-based AC in patients with normal lung tissue

AUTHORS: Maike E Lindemann, Marcel Gratz, Hong Grafe, Kai Jannusch, Lale Umutlu, Harald H Quick

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Background: Attenuation correction (AC) is an important methodical step in positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI) to correct for attenuated and scattered PET photons.

Purpose: The overall quality of magnetic resonance (MR)-based AC in whole-body PET/MRI was evaluated in direct comparison to computed tomography (CT)-based AC serving as reference. The quantitative impact of isolated tissue classes in the MR-AC was systematically investigated to identify potential optimization needs and strategies.

Methods: Data of n = 60 whole-body PET/CT patients with normal lung tissue and without metal implants/prostheses were used to generate six different AC-models based on the CT data for each patient, simulating variations of MR-AC. The original continuous CT-AC (CT-org) is referred to as reference. A pseudo MR-AC (CT-mrac), generated from CT data, with four tissue classes and a bone atlas represents the MR-AC. Relative difference in linear attenuation coefficients (LAC) and standardized uptake values were calculated. From the results two improvements regarding soft tissue AC and lung AC were proposed and evaluated.

Results: The overall performance of MR-AC is in good agreement compared to CT-AC. Lungs, heart, and bone tissue were identified as the regions with most deviation to the CT-AC (myocardium -15%, bone tissue -14%, and lungs ±20%). Using single-valued LACs for AC in the lung only provides limited accuracy. For improved soft tissue AC, splitting the combined soft tissue class into muscles and organs each with adapted LAC could reduce the deviations to the CT-AC to < ±1%. For improved lung AC, applying a gradient LAC in the lungs could remarkably reduce over- or undercorrections in PET signal compared to CT-AC (±5%).

Conclusions: The AC is important to ensure best PET image quality and accurate PET quantification for diagnostics and radiotherapy planning. The optimized segment-based AC proposed in this study, which was evaluated on PET/CT data, inherently reduces quantification bias in normal lung tissue and soft tissue compared to the CT-AC reference.

TITLE: A deep learning method for the recovery of standard-dose imaging quality from ultra-low-dose PET on wavelet domain

AUTHORS: Song Xue, Fanxuan Liu, Hanzhong Wang, Hong Zhu, Hasan Sari, Marco Viscione, Raphael Sznitman, Axel Rominger, Rui Guo, Biao Li, Kuangyu Shi

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Recent development in positron emission tomography (PET) dramatically increased the effective sensitivity by increasing the geometric coverage leading to total-body PET imaging. This encouraging breakthrough brings the hope of ultra-low dose PET imaging equivalent to transatlantic flight with the assistance of deep learning (DL)-based methods. However, conventional DL approaches face limitations in addressing the heterogeneous domain of PET imaging. This study aims to develop a wavelet-based DL method capable of restoring high-quality imaging from ultra-low-dose PET scans.

Materials and methods: In contrast to conventional DL techniques that denoise images in the spatial domain, we introduce WaveNet, a novel approach that inputs wavelet-decomposed frequency components of PET imaging to perform denoising in the frequency domain. A dataset comprising total-body18F -FDG PET images of 1447, acquired using total-body PET scanners including Biograph Vision Quadra (Siemens Healthineers) and uEXPLORER (United Imaging) in Bern and Shanghai, was utilized for developing and testing the proposed method. The quality of enhanced images was assessed using a customized scoring system, which incorporated weighted global physical metrics and local indices.

Results: Our proposed WaveNet consistently outperforms the baseline UNet model across all levels of dose reduction factors (DRF), with greater improvements observed as image quality decreases. Statistical analysis (p < 0.05) and visual inspection validated the superiority of WaveNet. Moreover, WaveNet demonstrated superior generalizability when applied to two cross-scanner datasets (p < 0.05).

Conclusion: WaveNet developed with total-body PET scanners may offer a computational-friendly and robust approach to recover image quality from ultra-low-dose PET imaging. Its adoption may enhance the reliability and clinical acceptance of DL-based dose reduction techniques.

TITLE: Low-dose PET image noise reduction using deep learning: application to cardiac viability FDG imaging in patients with ischemic heart disease

AUTHORS: Claes Nøhr Ladefoged, Philip Hasbak, Charlotte Hornnes, Liselotte Højgaard, Flemming Littrup Andersen

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Introduction: Cardiac [18F]FDG-PET is widely used for viability testing in patients with chronic ischemic heart disease. Guidelines recommend injection of 200-350 MBq [18F]FDG, however, a reduction of radiation exposure has become increasingly important, but might come at the cost of reduced diagnostic accuracy due to the increased noise in the images. We aimed to explore the use of a common deep learning (DL) network for noise reduction in low-dose PET images, and to validate its accuracy using the clinical quantitative metrics used to determine cardiac viability in patients with ischemic heart disease.

Methods: We included 168 patients imaged with cardiac [18F]FDG-PET/CT. We simulated a reduced dose by keeping counts at thresholds 1% and 10%. 3D U-net with five blocks was trained to de-noise full PET volumes (128 × 128 × 111). The low-dose and de-noised images were compared in Corridor4DM to the full-dose PET images. We used the default segmentation of the left ventricle to extract the quantitative metrics end-diastolic volume (EDV), end-systolic volume (ESV), and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) from the gated images, and FDG defect extent from the static images.

Results: Our de-noising models were able to recover the PET signal for both the static and gated images in either dose-reduction. For the 1% low-dose images, the error is most pronounced for EDV and ESV, where the average underestimation is 25%. No bias was observed using the proposed DL de-noising method. De-noising minimized the outliers found for the 1% and 10% low-dose measurements of LVEF and extent. Accuracy of differential diagnosis based on LVEF threshold was highly improved after de-noising.

Conclusion: A significant dose reduction can be achieved for cardiac [18F]FDG images used for viability testing in patients with ischemic heart disease without significant loss of diagnostic accuracy when using our DL model for noise reduction. Both 1% and 10% dose reductions are possible with clinically quantitative metrics comparable to that obtained with a full dose.

JOURNAL: Seminars in nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) are nuclear diagnostic imaging modalities that are routinely deployed for cancer staging and monitoring. They hold the advantage of detecting disease related biochemical and physiologic abnormalities in advance of anatomical changes, thus widely used for staging of disease progression, identification of the treatment gross tumor volume, monitoring of disease, as well as prediction of outcomes and personalization of treatment regimens. Among the arsenal of different functional imaging modalities, nuclear imaging has benefited from early adoption of quantitative image analysis starting from simple standard uptake value normalization to more advanced extraction of complex imaging uptake patterns; thanks to application of sophisticated image processing and machine learning algorithms. In this review, we discuss the application of image processing and machine/deep learning techniques to PET/CT imaging with special focus on the oncological radiotherapy domain as a case study and draw examples from our work and others to highlight current status and future potentials.

TITLE: Dynamic rubidium-82 PET/CT as a novel tool for quantifying hemodynamic differences in renal blood flow using a one-tissue compartment model

AUTHORS: Alina van de Burgt, Floris H P van Velden, Koen Kwakkenbos, Frits Smit, Lioe-Fee de Geus-Oei, Ilona A Dekkers

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Assessing renal perfusion in-vivo is challenging and quantitative information regarding renal hemodynamics is hardly incorporated in medical decision-making while abnormal renal hemodynamics might play a crucial role in the onset and progression of renal disease. Combining physiological stimuli with rubidium-82 positron emission tomography/computed tomography (82Rb PET/CT) offers opportunities to test the kidney perfusion under various conditions. The aim of this study is: (1) to investigate the application of a one-tissue compartment model for measuring renal hemodynamics with dynamic82Rb PET/CT imaging, and (2) to evaluate whether dynamic PET/CT is sensitive to detect differences in renal hemodynamics in stress conditions compared to resting state.

Methods: A one-tissue compartment model for the kidney was applied to cardiac82Rb PET/CT scans that were obtained for ischemia detection as part of clinical care. Retrospective data, collected from 17 patients undergoing dynamic myocardial82Rb PET/CT imaging in rest, were used to evaluate various CT-based volumes of interest (VOIs) of the kidney. Subsequently, retrospective data, collected from 10 patients (five impaired kidney functions and five controls) undergoing dynamic myocardial82Rb PET/CT imaging, were used to evaluate image-derived input functions (IDIFs), PET-based VOIs of the kidney, extraction fractions, and whether dynamic82Rb PET/CT can measure renal hemodynamics differences using the renal blood flow (RBF) values in rest and after exposure to adenosine pharmacological stress.

Results: The delivery rate (K1) values showed no significant (p = 0.14) difference between the mean standard deviation (SD) K1values using one CT-based VOI and the use of two, three, and four CT-based VOIs, respectively 2.01(0.32), 1.90(0.40), 1.93(0.39), and 1.94(0.40) mL/min/mL. The ratio between RBF in rest and RBF in pharmacological stress for the controls were overall significantly lower compared to the impaired kidney function group for both PET-based delineation methods (region growing and iso-contouring), with the smallest median interquartile range (IQR) of 0.40(0.28-0.66) and 0.96(0.62-1.15), respectively (p < 0.05). The K1of the impaired kidney function group were close to 1.0 mL/min/mL.

Conclusions: This study demonstrated that obtaining renal K1and RBF values using82Rb PET/CT was feasible using a one-tissue compartment model. Applying iso-contouring as the PET-based VOI of the kidney and using AA as an IDIF is suggested for consideration in further studies. Dynamic82Rb PET/CT imaging showed significant differences in renal hemodynamics in rest compared to when exposed to adenosine. This indicates that dynamic82Rb PET/CT has potential to detect differences in renal hemodynamics in stress conditions compared to the resting state, and might be useful as a novel diagnostic tool for assessing renal perfusion.

TITLE: On the effect of training database size for MR-based synthetic CT generation in the head

AUTHORS: Seyed Iman Zare Estakhraji, Ali Pirasteh, Tyler Bradshaw, Alan McMillan

JOURNAL: Computerized medical imaging and graphics : the official journal of the Computerized Medical Imaging Society

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Generation of computed tomography (CT) images from magnetic resonance (MR) images using deep learning methods has recently demonstrated promise in improving MR-guided radiotherapy and PET/MR imaging.

Purpose: To investigate the performance of unsupervised training using a large number of unpaired data sets as well as the potential gain in performance after fine-tuning with supervised training using spatially registered data sets in generation of synthetic computed tomography (sCT) from magnetic resonance (MR) images.

Materials and methods: A cycleGAN method consisting of two generators (residual U-Net) and two discriminators (patchGAN) was used for unsupervised training. Unsupervised training utilized unpaired T1-weighted MR and CT images (2061 sets for each modality). Five supervised models were then fine-tuned starting with the generator of the unsupervised model for 1, 10, 25, 50, and 100 pairs of spatially registered MR and CT images. Four supervised training models were also trained from scratch for 10, 25, 50, and 100 pairs of spatially registered MR and CT images using only the residual U-Net generator. All models were evaluated on a holdout test set of spatially registered images from 253 patients, including 30 with significant pathology. sCT images were compared against the acquired CT images using mean absolute error (MAE), Dice coefficient, and structural similarity index (SSIM). sCT images from 60 test subjects generated by the unsupervised, and most accurate of the fine-tuned and supervised models were qualitatively evaluated by a radiologist.

Results: While unsupervised training produced realistic-appearing sCT images, addition of even one set of registered images improved quantitative metrics. Addition of more paired data sets to the training further improved image quality, with the best results obtained using the highest number of paired data sets (n=100). Supervised training was found to be superior to unsupervised training, while fine-tuned training showed no clear benefit over supervised learning, regardless of the training sample size.

Conclusion: Supervised learning (using either fine tuning or full supervision) leads to significantly higher quantitative accuracy in the generation of sCT from MR images. However, fine-tuned training using both a large number of unpaired image sets was generally no better than supervised learning using registered image sets alone, suggesting the importance of well registered paired data set for training compared to a large set of unpaired data.

TITLE: The Value of Artificial Intelligence in Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen Positron Emission Tomography: An Update

AUTHORS: Jianliang Liu, Kieran Sandhu, Dixon T S Woon, Marlon Perera, Nathan Lawrentschuk

JOURNAL: Seminars in nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
This review aims to provide an up-to-date overview of the utility of artificial intelligence (AI) in evaluating prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positron emission tomography (PET) scans for prostate cancer (PCa). A literature review was conducted on the Medline, Embase, Web of Science, and IEEE Xplore databases. The search focused on studies that utilizes AI to evaluate PSMA PET scans. Original English language studies published from inception to October 2024 were included, while case reports, series, commentaries, and conference proceedings were excluded. AI applications show promise in automating the detection of metastatic disease and anatomical segmentation in PSMA PET scans. AI was also able to predict response to PSMA-based theragnostic and aids in tumor burden segmentation, improving radiotherapy planning. AI could also differentiate intraprostatic PCa with higher histological grade and predict extra-prostatic extension. AI has potential in evaluating PSMA PET scans for PCa, particularly in detecting metastasis, measuring tumor burden, detecting high grade intraprostatic cancer, and predicting treatment outcomes. Larger multicenter prospective studies are necessary to validate and enhance the generalizability of these AI models.

TITLE: MR Image-Based Attenuation Correction of Brain PET Imaging: Review of Literature on Machine Learning Approaches for Segmentation

AUTHORS: Imene Mecheter, Lejla Alic, Maysam Abbod, Abbes Amira, Jim Ji

JOURNAL: Journal of digital imaging

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Recent emerging hybrid technology of positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance (PET/MR) imaging has generated a great need for an accurate MR image-based PET attenuation correction. MR image segmentation, as a robust and simple method for PET attenuation correction, has been clinically adopted in commercial PET/MR scanners. The general approach in this method is to segment the MR image into different tissue types, each assigned an attenuation constant as in an X-ray CT image. Machine learning techniques such as clustering, classification and deep networks are extensively used for brain MR image segmentation. However, only limited work has been reported on using deep learning in brain PET attenuation correction. In addition, there is a lack of clinical evaluation of machine learning methods in this application. The aim of this review is to study the use of machine learning methods for MR image segmentation and its application in attenuation correction for PET brain imaging. Furthermore, challenges and future opportunities in MR image-based PET attenuation correction are discussed.

TITLE: High-resolution motion compensation for brain PET imaging using real-time electromagnetic motion tracking

AUTHORS: Wanbin Tan, Zipai Wang, Xinjie Zeng, Anthony Boccia, Xiuyuan Wang, Yixin Li, Yi Li, Edward K Fung, Jinyi Qi, Tianyi Zeng, Ajay Gupta, Amir H Goldan

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Background: Substantial improvements in spatial resolution in brain positron emission tomography (PET) scanners have greatly reduced partial volume effect, making head movement the main source of image blur. To achieve high-resolution PET neuroimaging, precise real-time estimation of both head position and orientation is essential for accurate motion compensation.

Purpose: A high-resolution electromagnetic motion tracking (EMMT) system with an event-by-event motion correction is developed for PET-CT scanners.

Methods: EMMT is comprised of a source, an array of sensors, and a readout electronic unit (REU). The source acts as a transmitter and emits an EM dipole field. It is placed in close proximity to the sensor array and detects changes in EM flux density due to sensor movement. The REU digitizes signals from each sensor and captures precise rotational and translational movements in real time. Tracked motion in the EMMT coordinate system is synchronized with the PET list-mode data and transformed into the scanner coordinate system by locating paired positions in both systems. The optimal rigid motion is estimated using singular value decomposition. The rigid motion and depth-of-interaction (DOI) parallax effect are corrected by event-by-event rebinning of mispositioned lines-of-response (LORs). We integrated the EMMT with our recently developed ultra-high resolution Prism-PET prototype brain scanner and a commercial Siemens Biograph mCT PET-CT scanner. We assessed the imaging performance of the Prism-PET/EMMT system using multi-frame motion of point sources and phantoms. The mCT/EMMT system was validated using a set of point sources attached to both a mannequin head and a human volunteer, for simulating multiframe and continuous motions, respectively. Additionally, a human subject for [18F]MK6240 PET imaging was included.

Results: The tracking accuracy of the Prism-PET/EMMT system was quantified as a root-mean-square (RMS) error of 0.49for 100axial rotations, and an RMS error of 0.15 mm for 100 mm translations.The percent difference (%diff) in average full width at half maximum (FWHM) of point source between motion-corrected and static images, within a motion range ofand10 mm from the center of the scanner's field-of-view (FOV), was 3.9%. The measured recovery coefficients of the 2.5-mm diameter sphere in the activity-filled partial volume correction phantom were 23.9%, 70.8%, and 74.0% for the phantom with multi-frame motion, with motion and motion compensation, and without motion, respectively. In the mCT/EMMT system, the %diff in average FWHM of point sources between motion-corrected and static images, within a motion range ofand10 mm from the center of the FOV, was 14%. Applying motion correction to the [18F]MK6240 PET imaging reduced the motion-induced spill-in artifact in the lateral ventricle region, lowering its standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) from 0.70 to 0.34.

Conclusions: The proposed EMMT system is a cost-effective, high frame-rate, and none-line-of-sight alternative to infrared camera-based tracking systems and is capable of achieving high rotational and translational tracking accuracies for mitigating motion-induced blur in high-resolution brain dedicated PET scanners.

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Background: Cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of death worldwide, including infection and inflammation related conditions. Multiple studies have demonstrated potential advantages of hybrid positron emission tomography combined with computed tomography (PET/CT) as an adjunct to current clinical inflammatory and infectious biochemical markers. To quantitatively analyze vascular diseases at PET/CT, robust segmentation of the aorta is necessary. However, manual segmentation is extremely time-consuming and labor-intensive.

Purpose: To investigate the feasibility and accuracy of an automated tool to segment and quantify multiple parts of the diseased aorta on unenhanced low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) as an anatomical reference for PET-assessed vascular disease.

Methods: A software pipeline was developed including automated segmentation using a 3D U-Net, calcium scoring, PET uptake quantification, background measurement, radiomics feature extraction, and 2D surface visualization of vessel wall calcium and tracer uptake distribution. To train the 3D U-Net, 352 non-contrast LDCTs from (2-[18F]FDG and Na[18F]F) PET/CTs performed in patients with various vascular pathologies with manual segmentation of the ascending aorta, aortic arch, descending aorta, and abdominal aorta were used. The last 22 consecutive scans were used as a hold-out internal test set. The remaining dataset was randomly split into training (n = 264; 80%) and validation (n = 66; 20%) sets. Further evaluation was performed on an external test set of 49 PET/CTs. The dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and Hausdorff distance (HD) were used to assess segmentation performance. Automatically obtained calcium scores and uptake values were compared with manual scoring obtained using clinical softwares (syngo.via and Affinity Viewer) in six patient images. intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were calculated to validate calcium and uptake values.

Results: Fully automated segmentation of the aorta using a 3D U-Net was feasible in LDCT obtained from PET/CT scans. The external test set yielded a DSC of 0.867 ± 0.030 and HD of 1.0 [0.6-1.4] mm, similar to an open-source model with a DSC of 0.864 ± 0.023 and HD of 1.4 [1.0-1.8] mm. Quantification of calcium and uptake values were in excellent agreement with clinical software (ICC: 1.00 [1.00-1.00] and 0.99 [0.93-1.00] for calcium and uptake values, respectively).

Conclusions: We present an automated pipeline to segment the ascending aorta, aortic arch, descending aorta, and abdominal aorta on LDCT from PET/CT and to accurately provide uptake values, calcium scores, background measurement, radiomics features, and a 2D visualization. We call this algorithm SEQUOIA (SEgmentation, QUantification, and visualizatiOn of the dIseased Aorta) and is available at https://github.com/UMCG-CVI/SEQUOIA. This model could augment the utility of aortic evaluation at PET/CT studies tremendously, irrespective of the tracer, and potentially provide fast and reliable quantification of cardiovascular diseases in clinical practice, both for primary diagnosis and disease monitoring.

TITLE: Timing performance evaluation of a dual-Axis rotational PET system according to NEMA NU 4-2008 standards: A simulation study

AUTHORS: P M C C Encarnação, P M M Correia, F M Ribeiro, J F C A Veloso

JOURNAL: Biomedical physics & engineering express

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Introduction:Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging's diagnostic accuracy is dependent on the scanner design and image quality, which is affected by several factors including the coincidence timing window (CTW). NEMA NU 4-2008 procedures are commonly used to assess and compare PET systems performance, including dual rotation technologies like easyPET.3D, known for high-spatial resolution and reduced parallax contribution.Aim:This study aims to identify easyPET.3D's optimal performance based on NEMA standards. In addition, explores the impact of different CTWs on PET image quality by comparing simulated electronics capable of a 300 ps CTW with a 40 ns CTW.Results:When the data is filtered by a 40 ns CTW, a sub-millimetre resolution at the field-of-view (FoV) centre and a constant behaviour in the radial direction are achieved. The absolute sensitivity was 0.18% with a maximum value of 0.31%, for a 15 mm transverse FoV. The noise equivalent count rate peaked at 18 MBq with 249 cps. Recovery coefficients ranged from 17% to 90%, and spilled-over ratios were 0.32 (water) and 0.41 (air).Conclusions:A shorter 300 ps CTW primarily impacted PET dynamic range, allowing higher activity acquisitions, with no significant changes in resolution and sensitivity under NEMA test conditions. As for the image quality test, the 300 ps CTW images have less background, better SOR values, and similar RC values when comparing the 40 ns CTW.

ABSTRACT:
Accurate coregistration of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging can provide clinically relevant and complementary information and can serve to facilitate multiple clinical tasks including surgical and radiation treatment planning, and generating a virtual Positron Emission Tomography (PET)/MR for the sites that do not have a PET/MR system available. Despite the long-standing interest in multimodality co-registration, a robust, routine clinical solution remains an unmet need. Part of the challenge may be the use of mutual information (MI) maximization and local phase difference (LPD) as similarity metrics, which have limited robustness, efficiency, and are difficult to optimize. Accordingly, we propose registering MR to CT by mapping the MR to a synthetic CT intermediate (sCT) and further using it in a sCT-CT deformable image registration (DIR) that minimizes the sum of squared differences. The resultant deformation field of a sCT-CT DIR is applied to the MRI to register it with the CT. Twenty-five sets of abdominopelvic imaging data are used for evaluation. The proposed method is compared to standard MI- and LPD-based methods, and the multimodality DIR provided by a state of the art, commercially available FDA-cleared clinical software package. The results are compared using global similarity metrics, Modified Hausdorff Distance, and Dice Similarity Index on six structures. Further, four physicians visually assessed and scored registered images for their registration accuracy. As evident from both quantitative and qualitative evaluation, the proposed method achieved registration accuracy superior to LPD- and MI-based methods and can refine the results of the commercial package DIR when using its results as a starting point. Supported by these, this manuscript concludes the proposed registration method is more robust, accurate, and efficient than the MI- and LPD-based methods.

TITLE: Robust and generalizable artificial intelligence for multi-organ segmentation in ultra-low-dose total-body PET imaging: a multi-center and cross-tracer study

AUTHORS: Hanzhong Wang, Xiaoya Qiao, Wenxiang Ding, Gaoyu Chen, Ying Miao, Rui Guo, Xiaohua Zhu, Zhaoping Cheng, Jiehua Xu, Biao Li, Qiu Huang

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a powerful molecular imaging tool that visualizes radiotracer distribution to reveal physiological processes. Recent advances in total-body PET have enabled low-dose, CT-free imaging; however, accurate organ segmentation using PET-only data remains challenging. This study develops and validates a deep learning model for multi-organ PET segmentation across varied imaging conditions and tracers, addressing critical needs for fully PET-based quantitative analysis.

Materials and methods: This retrospective study employed a 3D deep learning-based model for automated multi-organ segmentation on PET images acquired under diverse conditions, including low-dose and non-attenuation-corrected scans. Using a dataset of 798 patients from multiple centers with varied tracers, model robustness and generalizability were evaluated via multi-center and cross-tracer tests. Ground-truth labels for 23 organs were generated from CT images, and segmentation accuracy was assessed using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC).

Results: In the multi-center dataset from four different institutions, our model achieved average DSC values of 0.834, 0.825, 0.819, and 0.816 across varying dose reduction factors and correction conditions for FDG PET images. In the cross-tracer dataset, the model reached average DSC values of 0.737, 0.573, 0.830, 0.661, and 0.708 for DOTATATE, FAPI, FDG, Grazytracer, and PSMA, respectively.

Conclusion: The proposed model demonstrated effective, fully PET-based multi-organ segmentation across a range of imaging conditions, centers, and tracers, achieving high robustness and generalizability. These findings underscore the model's potential to enhance clinical diagnostic workflows by supporting ultra-low dose PET imaging.

Clinical trial number: Not applicable. This is a retrospective study based on collected data, which has been approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Ruijin Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine.

JOURNAL: Clinical nuclear medicine

ABSTRACT:
The assessment of tumor parameters derived from F-FDG PET/CT in oncology provides valuable information in non-small cell lung cancer. A proper segmentation should delineate tumor with high accuracy, being the most important step to measure metabolic parameters. However, there is still no consensus about the optimal methodology. Additionally, some clinical conditions inherently tied to tumor and imaging can limit the proper tumor delineation. We present some practical cases that represent different aspects to consider during segmentation of primary non-small cell lung cancer by using F-FDG-PET/CT and some possible solutions to tackle with the most common limitations in clinical practice.

ABSTRACT:
Full quantification of brain PET requires the blood input function (IF), which is traditionally achieved through an invasive and time-consuming arterial catheter procedure, making it unfeasible for clinical routine. This study presents a deep learning based method to estimate the input function (DLIF) for a dynamic brain FDG scan. A long short-term memory combined with a fully connected network was used. The dataset for training was generated from 85 total-body dynamic scans obtained on a uEXPLORER scanner. Time-activity curves from 8 brain regions and the carotid served as the input of the model, and labelled IF was generated from the ascending aorta defined on CT image. We emphasize the goodness-of-fitting of kinetic modeling as an additional physical loss to reduce the bias and the need for large training samples. DLIF was evaluated together with existing methods in terms of RMSE, area under the curve, regional and parametric image quantifications. The results revealed that the proposed model can generate IFs that closer to the reference ones in terms of shape and amplitude compared with the IFs generated using existing methods. All regional kinetic parameters calculated using DLIF agreed with reference values, with the correlation coefficient being 0.961 (0.913) and relative bias being 1.68±8.74% (0.37±4.93%) for [Formula: see text] ( [Formula: see text]. In terms of the visual appearance and quantification, parametric images were also highly identical to the reference images. In conclusion, our experiments indicate that a trained model can infer an image-derived IF from dynamic brain PET data, which enables subsequent reliable kinetic modeling.

ABSTRACT:
Objectives: Total-body PET/CT scanners with long axial fields of view have enabled unprecedented image quality and quantitative accuracy. However, the ionizing radiation from CT is a major issue in PET imaging, which is more evident with reduced radiopharmaceutical doses in total-body PET/CT. Therefore, we attempted to generate CT-free attenuation-corrected (CTF-AC) total-body PET images through deep learning.

Methods: Based on total-body PET data from 122 subjects (29 females and 93 males), a well-established cycle-consistent generative adversarial network (Cycle-GAN) was employed to generate CTF-AC total-body PET images directly while introducing site structures as prior information. Statistical analyses, including Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) and t-tests, were utilized for the correlation measurements.

Results: The generated CTF-AC total-body PET images closely resembled real AC PET images, showing reduced noise and good contrast in different tissue structures. The obtained peak signal-to-noise ratio and structural similarity index measure values were 36.92 ± 5.49 dB (p < 0.01) and 0.980 ± 0.041 (p < 0.01), respectively. Furthermore, the standardized uptake value (SUV) distribution was consistent with that of real AC PET images.

Conclusion: Our approach could directly generate CTF-AC total-body PET images, greatly reducing the radiation risk to patients from redundant anatomical examinations. Moreover, the model was validated based on a multidose-level NAC-AC PET dataset, demonstrating the potential of our method for low-dose PET attenuation correction. In future work, we will attempt to validate the proposed method with total-body PET/CT systems in more clinical practices.

Clinical relevance statement: The ionizing radiation from CT is a major issue in PET imaging, which is more evident with reduced radiopharmaceutical doses in total-body PET/CT. Our CT-free PET attenuation correction method would be beneficial for a wide range of patient populations, especially for pediatric examinations and patients who need multiple scans or who require long-term follow-up.

Key points: • CT is the main source of radiation in PET/CT imaging, especially for total-body PET/CT devices, and reduced radiopharmaceutical doses make the radiation burden from CT more obvious. • The CT-free PET attenuation correction method would be beneficial for patients who need multiple scans or long-term follow-up by reducing additional radiation from redundant anatomical examinations. • The proposed method could directly generate CT-free attenuation-corrected (CTF-AC) total-body PET images, which is beneficial for PET/MRI or PET-only devices lacking CT image poses.

TITLE: Synthesizing PET images from high-field and ultra-high-field MR images using joint diffusion attention model

ABSTRACT:
Background: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) stand as pivotal diagnostic tools for brain disorders, offering the potential for mutually enriching disease diagnostic perspectives. However, the costs associated with PET scans and the inherent radioactivity have limited the widespread application of PET. Furthermore, it is noteworthy to highlight the promising potential of high-field and ultra-high-field neuroimaging in cognitive neuroscience research and clinical practice. With the enhancement of MRI resolution, a related question arises: can high-resolution MRI improve the quality of PET images?

Purpose: This study aims to enhance the quality of synthesized PET images by leveraging the superior resolution capabilities provided by high-field and ultra-high-field MRI.

Methods: From a statistical perspective, the joint probability distribution is considered the most direct and fundamental approach for representing the correlation between PET and MRI. In this study, we proposed a novel model, the joint diffusion attention model, namely, the joint diffusion attention model (JDAM), which primarily focuses on learning information about the joint probability distribution. JDAM consists of two primary processes: the diffusion process and the sampling process. During the diffusion process, PET gradually transforms into a Gaussian noise distribution by adding Gaussian noise, while MRI remains fixed. The central objective of the diffusion process is to learn the gradient of the logarithm of the joint probability distribution between MRI and noise PET. The sampling process operates as a predictor-corrector. The predictor initiates a reverse diffusion process, and the corrector applies Langevin dynamics.

Results: Experimental results from the publicly available Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset highlight the effectiveness of the proposed model compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) models such as Pix2pix and CycleGAN. Significantly, synthetic PET images guided by ultra-high-field MRI exhibit marked improvements in signal-to-noise characteristics when contrasted with those generated from high-field MRI data. These results have been endorsed by medical experts, who consider the PET images synthesized through JDAM to possess scientific merit. This endorsement is based on their symmetrical features and precise representation of regions displaying hypometabolism, a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease.

Conclusions: This study establishes the feasibility of generating PET images from MRI. Synthesis of PET by JDAM significantly enhances image quality compared to SOTA models.

TITLE: Partial volume correction analysis for 11C-UCB-J PET studies of Alzheimer's disease

AUTHORS: Yihuan Lu, Takuya Toyonaga, Mika Naganawa, Jean-Dominique Gallezot, Ming-Kai Chen, Adam P Mecca, Christopher H van Dyck, Richard E Carson

JOURNAL: NeuroImage

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: 11C-UCB-J PET imaging, targeting synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A), has been shown to be a useful indicator of synaptic density in Alzheimer's disease (AD). For SV2A imaging, a decrease in apparent tracer uptake is often due to the combination of gray-matter (GM) atrophy and SV2A decrease in the remaining tissue. Our aim is to reveal the true SV2A change by performing partial volume correction (PVC).

Methods: We performed two PVC algorithms, Müller-Gärtner (MG) and 'iterative Yang' (IY), on 17 AD participants and 11 cognitive normal (CN) participants using the brain-dedicated HRRT scanner. Distribution volume VT, the rate constant K1, binding potential BPND(centrum semiovale as reference region), and tissue volume were compared.

Results: In most regions, both PVC algorithms reduced the between-group differences. Alternatively, in hippocampus, IY increased the significance of between-group differences while MG reduced it (VT, BPNDand K1group differences: uncorrected: 20%, 27%, 17%; MG: 18%, 22%, 14%; IY: 22%, 28%, 17%). The group difference in hippocampal volume (10%) was substantially smaller than any PET measures. MG increased GM binding values to a greater extent than IY due to differences in algorithm assumptions.

Conclusion: 11C-UCB-J binding is significantly reduced in AD hippocampus, but PVC is important to adjust for significant volume reduction. After correction, PET measures are substantially more sensitive to group differences than volumetric MRI measures. Assumptions of each PVC algorithm are important and should be carefully examined and validated. For11C-UCB-J, the less stringent assumptions of IY support its use as a PVC algorithm over MG.

TITLE: Optimization-derived blood input function using a kernel method and its evaluation with total-body PET for brain parametric imaging

AUTHORS: Yansong Zhu, Quyen Tran, Yiran Wang, Ramsey D Badawi, Simon R Cherry, Jinyi Qi, Shiva Abbaszadeh, Guobao Wang

JOURNAL: NeuroImage

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Dynamic PET allows quantification of physiological parameters through tracer kinetic modeling. For dynamic imaging of brain or head and neck cancer on conventional PET scanners with a short axial field of view, the image-derived input function (ID-IF) from intracranial blood vessels such as the carotid artery (CA) suffers from severe partial volume effects. Alternatively, optimization-derived input function (OD-IF) by the simultaneous estimation (SIME) method does not rely on an ID-IF but derives the input function directly from the data. However, the optimization problem is often highly ill-posed. We proposed a new method that combines the ideas of OD-IF and ID-IF together through a kernel framework. While evaluation of such a method is challenging in human subjects, we used the uEXPLORER total-body PET system that covers major blood pools to provide a reference for validation.

Methods: The conventional SIME approach estimates an input function using a joint estimation together with kinetic parameters by fitting time activity curves from multiple regions of interests (ROIs). The input function is commonly parameterized with a highly nonlinear model which is difficult to estimate. The proposed kernel SIME method exploits the CA ID-IF as a priori information via a kernel representation to stabilize the SIME approach. The unknown parameters are linear and thus easier to estimate. The proposed method was evaluated using18F-fluorodeoxyglucose studies with both computer simulations and 20 human-subject scans acquired on the uEXPLORER scanner. The effect of the number of ROIs on kernel SIME was also explored.

Results: The estimated OD-IF by kernel SIME showed a good match with the reference input function and provided more accurate estimation of kinetic parameters for both simulation and human-subject data. The kernel SIME led to the highest correlation coefficient (R = 0.97) and the lowest mean absolute error (MAE = 10.5 %) compared to using the CA ID-IF (R = 0.86, MAE = 108.2 %) and conventional SIME (R = 0.57, MAE = 78.7 %) in the human-subject evaluation. Adding more ROIs improved the overall performance of the kernel SIME method.

Conclusion: The proposed kernel SIME method shows promise to provide an accurate estimation of the blood input function and kinetic parameters for brain PET parametric imaging.

TITLE: Odense-Oxford PET Image Analysis (OPETIA): An FSL-based toolbox for multimodal neuroimaging

JOURNAL: NeuroImage

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Advanced analysis of MRI and PET images provides quantitative and accurate information about the brain structure and function, allowing differential diagnosis, prognosis, and personalized treatment. Most clinical software lack accurate quantification. Here we developed a user-friendly multimodal neuroimage analysis toolbox, named Odense-Oxford PET Image Analysis (OPETIA), based on Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Brain Software Library (FSL) and Python programming language. FSL is a strong toolbox library for MRI analysis but has not been widely used for PET image analysis. OPETIA includes a graphical user interface that facilitates automatic multimodal neuroimage analysis. OPETIA can automatically pre-process magnetic resonance, and PET images and calculates maximum, mean, and standard deviation of Standardized Uptake Value (SUV) and Standardized Uptake Value Ratio (SUVR) in the volumes of interest (VOI). To assess the efficacy of OPETIA, we analysed a set of static18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET and MRIs of healthy subjects and patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset using OPETIA and compared the SUVR measurements with those obtained from Statistical Parametric Mapping, version 12 (SPM12). The result of this comparison showed a close association between OPETIA and SPM12 results (p-value 〈 0.01, r 〉 0.8). OPETIA measurements were significantly (p-value < 0.01) larger than those of SPM12 in all brain regions (according to the Harvard-Oxford brain atlas), indicating a systematic difference between these tools. The Cronbach's Alpha values for both tools were > 0.9, indicating a high reproducibility. We compared the group difference (control vs Alzheimer's disease) obtained from each toolbox using two-sample t-test and found significantly (p-value < 0.01) larger Cohen's d values for SUVRs from OPETIA (d = 0.22) than SPM12 (d = 0.04). We suggest that OPETIA is a user-friendly and robust tool for quantitative analysis of multimodal neuroimaging such as cerebral PET and MR images.

TITLE: Deep learning aided oropharyngeal cancer segmentation with adaptive thresholding for predicted tumor probability in FDG PET and CT images

AUTHORS: Alessia De Biase, Nanna M Sijtsema, Lisanne V van Dijk, Johannes A Langendijk, Peter M A van Ooijen

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Objective.Tumor segmentation is a fundamental step for radiotherapy treatment planning. To define an accurate segmentation of the primary tumor (GTVp) of oropharyngeal cancer patients (OPC) each image volume is explored slice-by-slice from different orientations on different image modalities. However, the manual fixed boundary of segmentation neglects the spatial uncertainty known to occur in tumor delineation. This study proposes a novel deep learning-based method that generates probability maps which capture the model uncertainty in the segmentation task.Approach.We included 138 OPC patients treated with (chemo)radiation in our institute. Sequences of 3 consecutive 2D slices of concatenated FDG-PET/CT images and GTVp contours were used as input. Our framework exploits inter and intra-slice context using attention mechanisms and bi-directional long short term memory (Bi-LSTM). Each slice resulted in three predictions that were averaged. A 3-fold cross validation was performed on sequences extracted from the axial, sagittal, and coronal plane. 3D volumes were reconstructed and single- and multi-view ensembling were performed to obtain final results. The output is a tumor probability map determined by averaging multiple predictions.Main Results.Model performance was assessed on 25 patients at different probability thresholds. Predictions were the closest to the GTVp at a threshold of 0.9 (mean surface DSC of 0.81, median HD95of 3.906 mm).Significance.The promising results of the proposed method show that is it possible to offer the probability maps to radiation oncologists to guide them in a in a slice-by-slice adaptive GTVp segmentation.

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Quantification of tau load using11C-PBB3-PET has the potential to improve diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases. Although MRI-based pre-processing is used as a reference method, not all patients have MRI. The feasibility of a PET-based pre-processing for the quantification of11C-PBB3 tracer was evaluated and compared with the MRI-based method.

Materials and methods: Fourteen patients with decreased recent memory were examined with11C-PBB3-PET and MRI. The PET scans were visually assessed and rated as either PBB3(+) or PBB3(-). The image processing based on the PET-based method was validated against the MRI-based approach. The regional uptakes were quantified using the Mesial-temporal/Temporoparietal/Rest of neocortex (MeTeR) regions. SUVR values were calculated by normalizing to the cerebellar reference region to compare both methods within the patient groups.

Results: Significant correlations were observed between the SUVRs of the MRI-based and the PET-based methods in the MeTeR regions (rMe=0.91; rTe=0.98; rR=0.96; p<0.0001). However, the Bland-Altman plot showed a significant bias between both methods in the subcortical Me region (bias: -0.041; 95% CI: -0.061 to -0.024; p=0.003). As in the MRI-based method, the11C-PBB3 uptake obtained with the PET-based method was higher for the PBB3(+) group in each of the cortical regions and for the whole brain than for the PBB3(-) group (PET-basedGlobal: 1.11 vs. 0.96; Cliff's Delta (d)=0.68; p=0.04; MRI-basedGlobal: 1.11 vs. 0.97; d=0.70; p=0.03). To differentiate between positive and negative scans, Youden's index estimated the best cut-off of 0.99 from the ROC curve with good accuracy (AUC: 0.88±0.10; 95% CI: 0.67-1.00) and the same sensitivity (83%) and specificity (88%) for both methods.

Conclusion: The PET-based pre-processing method developed to quantify the tau burden with11C-PBB3 provided comparable SUVR values and effect sizes as the MRI-based reference method. Furthermore, both methods have a comparable discrimination accuracy between PBB3(+) and PBB3(-) groups as assessed by visual rating. Therefore, the presented PET-based method can be used for clinical diagnosis if no MRI image is available.

JOURNAL: Computer methods and programs in biomedicine

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Purpose To minimize the various errors introduced by image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) in the application of esophageal cancer treatment, this study proposes a novel technique based on the 'CBCT-only' mode of pseudo-medical image guidance. Methods The framework of this technology consists of two pseudo-medical image synthesis models in the CBCT→CT and the CT→PET direction. The former utilizes a dual-domain parallel deep learning model called AWM-PNet, which incorporates attention waning mechanisms. This model effectively suppresses artifacts in CBCT images in both the sinogram and spatial domains while efficiently capturing important image features and contextual information. The latter leverages tumor location and shape information provided by clinical experts. It introduces a PRAM-GAN model based on a prior region aware mechanism to establish a non-linear mapping relationship between CT and PET image domains. As a result, it enables the generation of pseudo-PET images that meet the clinical requirements for radiotherapy. Results The NRMSE and multi-scale SSIM (MS-SSIM) were utilized to evaluate the test set, and the results were presented as median values with lower quartile and upper quartile ranges. For the AWM-PNet model, the NRMSE and MS-SSIM values were 0.0218 (0.0143, 0.0255) and 0.9325 (0.9141, 0.9410), respectively. The PRAM-GAN model produced NRMSE and MS-SSIM values of 0.0404 (0.0356, 0.0476) and 0.9154 (0.8971, 0.9294), respectively. Statistical analysis revealed significant differences (p < 0.05) between these models and others. The numerical results of dose metrics, including D98 %, Dmean, and D2 %, validated the accuracy of HU values in the pseudo-CT images synthesized by the AWM-PNet. Furthermore, the Dice coefficient results confirmed statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) in GTV delineation between the pseudo-PET images synthesized using the PRAM-GAN model and other compared methods. Conclusion The AWM-PNet and PRAM-GAN models have the capability to generate accurate pseudo-CT and pseudo-PET images, respectively. The pseudo-image-guided technique based on the 'CBCT-only' mode shows promising prospects for application in esophageal cancer radiotherapy.

JOURNAL: NeuroImage

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Head motion during PET scans causes image quality degradation, decreased concentration in regions with high uptake and incorrect outcome measures from kinetic analysis of dynamic datasets. Previously, we proposed a data-driven method, center of tracer distribution (COD), to detect head motion without an external motion tracking device. There, motion was detected using one dimension of the COD trace with a semiautomatic detection algorithm, requiring multiple user defined parameters and manual intervention. In this study, we developed a new data-driven motion detection algorithm, which is automatic, self-adaptive to noise level, does not require user-defined parameters and uses all three dimensions of the COD trace (3DCOD). 3DCOD was first validated and tested using 30 simulation studies (18F-FDG, N = 15;11C-raclopride (RAC), N = 15) with large motion. The proposed motion correction method was tested on 22 real human datasets, with 20 acquired from a high resolution research tomograph (HRRT) scanner (18F-FDG, N = 10;11C-RAC, N = 10) and 2 acquired from the Siemens Biograph mCT scanner. Real-time hardware-based motion tracking information (Vicra) was available for all real studies and was used as the gold standard. 3DCOD was compared to Vicra, no motion correction (NMC), one-direction COD (our previous method called 1DCOD) and two conventional frame-based image registration (FIR) algorithms, i.e., FIR1 (based on predefined frames reconstructed with attenuation correction) and FIR2 (without attenuation correction) for both simulation and real studies. For the simulation studies, 3DCOD yielded -2.3 ± 1.4% (mean ± standard deviation across all subjects and 11 brain regions) error in region of interest (ROI) uptake for18F-FDG (-3.4 ± 1.7% for11C-RAC across all subjects and 2 regions) as compared to Vicra (perfect correction) while NMC, FIR1, FIR2 and 1DCOD yielded -25.4 ± 11.1% (-34.5 ± 16.1% for11C- RAC), -13.4 ± 3.5% (-16.1 ± 4.6%), -5.7 ± 3.6% (-8.0 ± 4.5%) and -2.6 ± 1.5% (-5.1 ± 2.7%), respectively. For real HRRT studies, 3DCOD yielded -0.3 ± 2.8% difference for18F-FDG (-0.4 ± 3.2% for11C-RAC) as compared to Vicra while NMC, FIR1, FIR2 and 1DCOD yielded -14.9 ± 9.0% (-24.5 ± 14.6%), -3.6 ± 4.9% (-13.4 ± 14.3%), -0.6 ± 3.4% (-6.7 ± 5.3%) and -1.5 ± 4.2% (-2.2 ± 4.1%), respectively. In summary, the proposed motion correction method yielded comparable performance to the hardware-based motion tracking method for multiple tracers, including very challenging cases with large frequent head motion, in studies performed on a non-TOF scanner.

TITLE: Assessing privacy leakage in synthetic 3-D PET imaging using transversal GAN

AUTHORS: Robert V Bergen, Jean-Francois Rajotte, Fereshteh Yousefirizi, Arman Rahmim, Raymond T Ng

JOURNAL: Computer methods and programs in biomedicine

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Background and objective: Training computer-vision related algorithms on medical images for disease diagnosis or image segmentation is difficult in large part due to privacy concerns. For this reason, generative image models are highly sought after to facilitate data sharing. However, 3-D generative models are understudied, and investigation of their privacy leakage is needed.

Methods: We introduce our 3-D generative model, Transversal GAN (TrGAN), using head & neck PET images which are conditioned on tumor masks as a case study. We define quantitative measures of image fidelity and utility, and propose a novel framework for evaluating privacy-utility trade-off through membership inference attack. These metrics are evaluated in the course of training to identify ideal fidelity, utility and privacy trade-offs and establish the relationships between these parameters.

Results: We show that the discriminator of the TrGAN is vulnerable to attack, and that an attacker can identify which samples were used in training with almost perfect accuracy (AUC = 0.99). We also show that an attacker with access to only the generator cannot reliably classify whether a sample had been used for training (AUC = 0.51). We also propose and demonstrate a general decision procedure for any deep learning based generative model, which allows the user to quantify and evaluate the decision trade-off between downstream utility and privacy protection.

Conclusions: TrGAN can generate 3-D medical images that retain important image features and statistical properties of the training data set, with minimal privacy loss as determined by a membership inference attack. Our utility-privacy decision procedure may be beneficial to researchers who wish to share data or lack a sufficient number of large labeled image datasets.

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: This study was to develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) model with a residual learning framework to predict the full-time 18F-florbetaben (18F-FBB) PET/CT images from corresponding short-time scans.

Methods: In this retrospective study, we enrolled 22 cognitively normal subjects, 20 patients with mild cognitive impairment, and 42 patients with Alzheimer disease. Twenty minutes of list-mode PET/CT data were acquired and reconstructed as the ground-truth images. The short-time scans were made in either 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 minutes. The CNN with a residual learning framework was implemented to predict the ground-truth images of 18F-FBB PET/CT using short-time scans with either a single-slice or a 3-slice input layer. Model performance was evaluated by quantitative and qualitative analyses. Additionally, we quantified the amyloid load in the ground-truth and predicted images using the SUV ratio.

Results: On quantitative analyses, with increasing scan time, the normalized root-mean-squared error and the SUV ratio differences between predicted and ground-truth images gradually decreased, and the peak signal-to-noise ratio increased. On qualitative analysis, the predicted images from the 3-slice CNN model showed better image quality than those from the single-slice model. The 3-slice CNN model with a short-time scan of at least 2 minutes achieved comparable, quantitative prediction of full-time 18F-FBB PET/CT images, with adequate to excellent image quality.

Conclusions: The 3-slice CNN model with a residual learning framework is promising for the prediction of full-time 18F-FBB PET/CT images from short-time scans.

JOURNAL: NeuroImage

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Reducing the injected activity and/or the scanning time is a desirable goal to minimize radiation exposure and maximize patients' comfort. To achieve this goal, we developed a deep neural network (DNN) model for synthesizing full-dose (FD) time-of-flight (TOF) bin sinograms from their corresponding fast/low-dose (LD) TOF bin sinograms.

Methods: Clinical brain PET/CT raw data of 140 normal and abnormal patients were employed to create LD and FD TOF bin sinograms. The LD TOF sinograms were created through 5% undersampling of FD list-mode PET data. The TOF sinograms were split into seven time bins (0, ±1, ±2, ±3). Residual network (ResNet) algorithms were trained separately to generate FD bins from LD bins. An extra ResNet model was trained to synthesize FD images from LD images to compare the performance of DNN in sinogram space (SS) vs implementation in image space (IS). Comprehensive quantitative and statistical analysis was performed to assess the performance of the proposed model using established quantitative metrics, including the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index metric (SSIM) region-wise standardized uptake value (SUV) bias and statistical analysis for 83 brain regions.

Results: SSIM and PSNR values of 0.97 ± 0.01, 0.98 ± 0.01 and 33.70 ± 0.32, 39.36 ± 0.21 were obtained for IS and SS, respectively, compared to 0.86 ± 0.02and 31.12 ± 0.22 for reference LD images. The absolute average SUV bias was 0.96 ± 0.95% and 1.40 ± 0.72% for SS and IS implementations, respectively. The joint histogram analysis revealed the lowest mean square error (MSE) and highest correlation (R2= 0.99, MSE = 0.019) was achieved by SS compared to IS (R2= 0.97, MSE= 0.028). The Bland & Altman analysis showed that the lowest SUV bias (-0.4%) and minimum variance (95% CI: -2.6%, +1.9%) were achieved by SS images. The voxel-wise t-test analysis revealed the presence of voxels with statistically significantly lower values in LD, IS, and SS images compared to FD images respectively.

Conclusion: The results demonstrated that images reconstructed from the predicted TOF FD sinograms using the SS approach led to higher image quality and lower bias compared to images predicted from LD images.

TITLE: Evaluating the image quality of combined positron emission tomography-magnetic resonance images acquired in the pelvic radiotherapy position

AUTHORS: Jonathan J Wyatt, Elizabeth Howell, Maelene Lohezic, Hazel M McCallum, Ross J Maxwell

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Positron emission tomography-magnetic resonance (PET-MR) scanners could improve radiotherapy planning through combining PET and MR functional imaging. This depends on acquiring high quality and quantitatively accurate images in the radiotherapy position. This study evaluated PET-MR image quality using a flat couch and coil bridge for pelvic radiotherapy. MR and PET image quality phantoms were imaged in three setups: phantom on the PET-MR couch with anterior coil on top (diagnostic), phantom on a flat couch with coil on top (couch), and phantom on the flat couch with coil on a coil bridge (radiotherapy). PET images were also acquired in each setup without the anterior coil. PET attenuation correction of the flat couch and coil bridge were generated using kilovoltage computed tomography (CT) images and of the anterior coil using megavoltage CT images. MR image quality was substantially affected, with MR signal to noise ratio (SNR) relative to the diagnostic setup of 89% ± 2% (mean ± standard error of the mean, couch) and 54% ± 1% (radiotherapy), likely due to the increased distance between the patient and receive coils. The reduction impacted the low-contrast detectability score: 23 ± 1 (diagnostic), 19.7 ± 0.3 (couch) and 15 ± 1 (radiotherapy). All other MR metrics agreed within one standard error. PET quantitative accuracy was also affected, with measured activity with anterior coil being different to diagnostic without anterior coil by -16.7% ± 0.2% (couch) and -17.7 ± 0.1% (radiotherapy), without attenuation correction modification. Including the couch and coil bridge attenuation correction reduced this difference to -7.5% ± 0.1%, and including the anterior coil reduced this to -2.7% ± 0.1%. This was better than the diagnostic setup with anterior coil (difference -8.3% ± 0.2%). This translated into greater PET SNR performance for the fully corrected radiotherapy setup compared to diagnostic with coil. However contrast recovery was unchanged by the modified attenuation correction, with the diagnostic setup remaining ∼2% better. Quantitative PET in the radiotherapy setup is possible if appropriate attenuation correction is used. Pelvic radiotherapy PET-MR imaging protocols will need to consider the impact on PET-MR image quality.

TITLE: Reliability of Quantitative 18F-FDG PET/CT Imaging Biomarkers for Classifying Early Response to Chemoradiotherapy in Patients With Locally Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer

AUTHORS: Kevin P Horn, Hannah M T Thomas, Hubert J Vesselle, Paul E Kinahan, Robert S Miyaoka, Ramesh Rengan, Jing Zeng, Stephen R Bowen

JOURNAL: Clinical nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Purpose of the report: We evaluated the reliability of 18F-FDG PET imaging biomarkers to classify early response status across observers, scanners, and reconstruction algorithms in support of biologically adaptive radiation therapy for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer.

Patients and methods: Thirty-one patients with unresectable locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer were prospectively enrolled on a phase 2 trial (NCT02773238) and underwent 18F-FDG PET on GE Discovery STE (DSTE) or GE Discovery MI (DMI) PET/CT systems at baseline and during the third week external beam radiation therapy regimens. All PET scans were reconstructed using OSEM; GE-DMI scans were also reconstructed with BSREM-TOF (block sequential regularized expectation maximization reconstruction algorithm incorporating time of flight). Primary tumors were contoured by 3 observers using semiautomatic gradient-based segmentation. SUVmax, SUVmean, SUVpeak, MTV (metabolic tumor volume), and total lesion glycolysis were correlated with midtherapy multidisciplinary clinical response assessment. Dice similarity of contours and response classification areas under the curve were evaluated across observers, scanners, and reconstruction algorithms. LASSO logistic regression models were trained on DSTE PET patient data and independently tested on DMI PET patient data.

Results: Interobserver variability of PET contours was low for both OSEM and BSREM-TOF reconstructions; intraobserver variability between reconstructions was slightly higher. ΔSUVpeak was the most robust response predictor across observers and image reconstructions. LASSO models consistently selected ΔSUVpeak and ΔMTV as response predictors. Response classification models achieved high cross-validated performance on the DSTE cohort and more variable testing performance on the DMI cohort.

Conclusions: The variability FDG PET lesion contours and imaging biomarkers was relatively low across observers, scanners, and reconstructions. Objective midtreatment PET response assessment may lead to improved precision of biologically adaptive radiation therapy.

TITLE: PET/CT-based 3D multi-class semantic segmentation of ovarian cancer and the stability of the extracted radiomics features

AUTHORS: Mohammad Hossein Sadeghi, Sedigheh Sina, Mehrosadat Alavi, Francesco Giammarile, Chai Hong Yeong

JOURNAL: Physical and engineering sciences in medicine

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Accurate segmentation of ovarian cancer (OC) lesions in PET/CT images is essential for effective disease management, yet manual segmentation for radiomics analysis is labor-intensive and time-consuming. This study introduces the application of a 3D U-Net deep learning model, leveraging advanced 3D networks, for multi-class semantic segmentation of OC in PET/CT images and assesses the stability of the extracted radiomics features. Utilizing a dataset of 3120 PET/CT images from 39 OC patients, the dataset was divided into training (70%), validation (15%), and test (15%) subsets to optimize and evaluate the model's performance. The 3D U-Net model, especially with a VGG16 backbone, achieved notable segmentation accuracy with a Dice score of 0.74, Precision of 0.76, and Recall of 0.78. Additionally, the study demonstrated high stability in radiomics features, with over 85% of PET and 84% of CT image features showing high intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs > 0.8). These results underscore the potential of automated 3D U-Net-based segmentation to significantly enhance OC diagnosis and treatment planning. The reliability of the extracted radiomics features from automated segmentation supports its application in clinical decision-making and personalized medicine. This research marks a significant advancement in oncology diagnostics, providing a robust and efficient method for segmenting OC lesions in PET/CT images. By addressing the challenges of manual segmentation and demonstrating the effectiveness of 3D networks, this study contributes to the growing body of evidence supporting the application of artificial intelligence in improving diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes in oncology.

TITLE: 3D Compton image reconstruction method for whole gamma imaging

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

ABSTRACT:
Compton imaging or Compton camera imaging has been studied well, but its advantages in nuclear medicine and molecular imaging have not been demonstrated yet. Therefore, the aim of this work was to compare Compton imaging with positron emission tomography (PET) by using the same imaging platform of whole gamma imaging (WGI). WGI is a concept that combines PET with Compton imaging by inserting a scatterer ring into a PET ring. This concept utilizes diverse types of gamma rays for 3D tomographic imaging. In this paper, we remodeled our previous WGI prototype for small animal imaging, and we developed an image reconstruction method based on a list-mode ordered subset expectation maximization algorithm incorporating detector response function modeling, random correction and normalization (sensitivity correction) for either PET and Compton imaging. To the best of our knowledge, this is the world's first realization of a full-ring Compton imaging system. We selected89Zr as an imaging target because a89Zr nuclide emits a 909 keV single-gamma ray as well as a positron, and we can directly compare Compton imaging of 909 keV photons with PET, a well-established modality. We measured a cylindrical phantom and a small rod phantom filled with89Zr solutions of 10.3 MBq and 10.2 MBq activity, respectively, for 1 h each. The uniform radioactivity distribution of the cylindrical phantom was reconstructed with normalization in both PET and Compton imaging. Coefficients of variation for region-of-interest values were 4.2% for Compton imaging and 3.3% for PET; the difference might be explained by the difference in the detected count number. The small rod phantom experiment showed that the WGI Compton imaging had spatial resolution better than 3.0 mm at the peripheral region although the center region had lower resolution. PET resolved 2.2 mm rods clearly at any location. We measured a mouse for 1 h, 1 d after injection of 9.8 MBq89Zr oxalate. The89Zr assimilated in the mouse bony structures was clearly depicted, and Compton imaging results agreed well with PET images, especially for the region inside the scatterer ring. In conclusion, we demonstrated the performance of WGI using the developed Compton image reconstruction method. We realized Compton imaging with a quality approaching that of PET, which is supporting a future expectation that Compton imaging outperforms PET.

TITLE: Truncation compensation and metallic dental implant artefact reduction in PET/MRI attenuation correction using deep learning-based object completion

AUTHORS: Hossein Arabi, Habib Zaidi

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
The susceptibility of MRI to metallic objects leads to void MR signal and missing information around metallic implants. In addition, body truncation occurs in MR imaging for large patients who exceed the transaxial field-of-view of the scanner. Body truncation and metal artefacts translate to incomplete MRI-derived attenuation correction (AC) maps, consequently resulting in large quantification errors in PET imaging. In this work, we propose a deep learning-based approach to predict the missing information/regions in MR images affected by metallic artefacts and/or body truncation aiming at reducing quantification errors in PET/MRI. Twenty-five whole-body (WB) co-registered PET, CT, and MR images were used for training and evaluation of the object completion approach. CT-based attenuation corrected PET images were considered as reference for the quantitative evaluation of the proposed approach. Its performance was compared to the 3-class segmentation-based AC approach (containing background air, soft-tissue and lung) obtained from MR images. The metal-induced artefacts affected 8.1 ± 1.8% of the volume of the head region when using the 3-class AC maps. This error reduced to 0.9 ± 0.5% after application of object completion on MR images. Consequently, quantification errors in PET images reduced from -57.5 ± 11% to -18.5 ± 5% in the head region after metal artefact correction. The percentage of the torso volume affected by body truncation in the 3-class AC maps reduced from 9.8 ± 1.9% to 0.6 ± 0.3% after truncation compensation. PET quantification errors in the affected regions were also reduced from -45.5 ± 10% to -9.5 ± 3% after truncation compensation. The quantitative results demonstrated promising performance of the proposed approach towards the completion of MR images corrupted by metal artefacts and/or body truncation in the context of WB PET/MR imaging.

ABSTRACT:
The reliance of quantitative PET imaging on the arterial input function makes brain PET challenging to perform in certain populations, limiting the sample size. To address this challenge, a supervised clustering algorithm (SVCA) has been introduced as an alternative. Our objective was to validate SVCA's performance for brain PET with [11C]DPA-713 that targets a putative marker of brain injury and repair.Methods:This study included a composite dataset comprising 12 healthy volunteers (HVs), with 6 participants from Weill Cornell Medicine and 6 participants from Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. The minimum number of subjects required to define kinetic classes was identified. Next, the distribution volume ratio (DVR) was examined by comparing pseudoreference time-activity curves derived from SVCA (SVCA-DVR) with the conventional arterial input function-based DVR (AIF-DVR). Test-retest analysis was conducted to evaluate repeatability, considering volumes of interest (VOIs) of various sizes. Lastly, the research investigated differences in DVR values between the HVs and patients with multiple sclerosis.Results:The number of subjects necessary for the kinetic classes, which are critical to SVCA, was reduced to 7 from the existing minimum requirement of 10. This allowed for a more substantial independent validation within a defined dataset. Correlative analysis between SVCA-DVR and AIF-DVR demonstrated a strong relationship, with correlation coefficients of 0.86 for white matter and 0.95 for the thalamus. Furthermore, we noted a marked decline in absolute test-retest variability for SVCA-DVR, with reductions from 1.31% to 1.18% in white matter and 3.51% to 2.32% in the thalamus, relative to AIF-DVR. This pattern of reduced variability persisted across VOIs of disparate sizes, with the absolute test-retest variability remaining below 5% for SVCA-DVR, even in small VOIs (both high and low binding at 0.065 cm3). Analysis revealed a pronounced disparity in SVCA-DVR values of the thalamus when comparing HVs and patients with multiple sclerosis.Conclusion:The findings substantiate the pseudoreference time-activity curves derived from SVCA as a dependable and practical substitute for the quantification of [11C]DPA-713 PET scans of the brain.

TITLE: Incorporation of anatomical MRI knowledge for enhanced mapping of brain metabolism using functional PET

AUTHORS: Viswanath P Sudarshan, Shenpeng Li, Sharna D Jamadar, Gary F Egan, Suyash P Awate, Zhaolin Chen

JOURNAL: NeuroImage

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Functional positron emission tomography (fPET) imaging using continuous infusion of [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is a novel neuroimaging technique to track dynamic glucose utilization in the brain. In comparison to conventional static or dynamic bolus PET, fPET maintains a sustained supply of glucose in the blood plasma which improves sensitivity to measure dynamic glucose changes in the brain, and enables mapping of dynamic brain activity in task-based and resting-state fPET studies. However, there is a trade-off between temporal resolution and spatial noise due to the low concentration of FDG and the limited sensitivity of multi-ring PET scanners. Images from fPET studies suffer from partial volume errors and residual scatter noise that may cause the cerebral metabolic functional maps to be biased. Gaussian smoothing filters used to denoise the fPET images are suboptimal, as they introduce additional partial volume errors. In this work, a post-processing framework based on a magnetic resonance (MR) Bowsher-like prior was used to improve the spatial and temporal signal to noise characteristics of the fPET images. The performance of the MR guided method was compared with conventional denosing methods using both simulated and in vivo task fPET datasets. The results demonstrate that the MR-guided fPET framework denoises the fPET images and improves the partial volume correction, consequently enhancing the sensitivity to identify brain activation, and improving the anatomical accuracy for mapping changes of brain metabolism in response to a visual stimulation task. The framework extends the use of functional PET to investigate the dynamics of brain metabolic responses for faster presentation of brain activation tasks, and for applications in low dose PET imaging.

TITLE: Generation of synthetic PET/MR fusion images from MR images using a combination of generative adversarial networks and conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic models based on simultaneous 18F-FDG PET/MR image data of pyogenic spondylodiscitis

AUTHORS: Euijin Jung, Eunjung Kong, Dongwoo Yu, Heesung Yang, Philip Chicontwe, Sang Hyun Park, Ikchan Jeon

JOURNAL: The spine journal : official journal of the North American Spine Society

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Background context: Cross-modality image generation from magnetic resonance (MR) to positron emission tomography (PET) using the generative model can be expected to have complementary effects by addressing the limitations and maximizing the advantages inherent in each modality.

Purpose: This study aims to generate synthetic PET/MR fusion images from MR images using a combination of generative adversarial networks (GANs) and conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic models (cDDPMs) based on simultaneous18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) PET/MR image data.

Study design: Retrospective study with prospectively collected clinical and radiological data.

Patient sample: This study included 94 patients (60 men and 34 women) with thoraco-lumbar pyogenic spondylodiscitis (PSD) from February 2017 to January 2020 in a single tertiary institution.

Outcome measures: Quantitative and qualitative image similarity were analyzed between the real and synthetic PET/ T2-weighted fat saturation MR (T2FS) fusion images on the test data set.

Methods: We used paired spinal sagittal T2FS and PET/T2FS fusion images of simultaneous 18F-FDG PET/MR imaging examination in patients with PSD, which were employed to generate synthetic PET/T2FS fusion images from T2FS images using a combination of Pix2Pix (U-Net generator + Least Squares GANs discriminator) and cDDPMs algorithms. In the analyses of image similarity between the real and synthetic PET/T2FS fusion images, we adopted the values of mean peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR), mean structural similarity measurement (SSIM), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean squared error (MSE) for quantitative analysis, while the discrimination accuracy by three spine surgeons was applied for qualitative analysis.

Results: Total of 2,082 pairs of T2FS and PET/T2FS fusion images were obtained from 172 examinations on 94 patients, which were randomly assigned to training, validation, and test data sets in 8:1:1 ratio (1664, 209, and 209 pairs). The quantitative analysis revealed PSNR of 30.634 ± 3.437, SSIM of 0.910 ± 0.067, MAE of 0.017 ± 0.008, and MSE of 0.001 ± 0.001, respectively. The values of PSNR, MAE, and MSE significantly decreased as FDG uptake increased in real PET/T2FS fusion image, with no significant correlation on SSIM. In the qualitative analysis, the overall discrimination accuracy between real and synthetic PET/T2FS fusion images was 47.4%.

Conclusions: The combination of Pix2Pix and cDDPMs demonstrated the potential for cross-modal image generation from MR to PET images, with reliable quantitative and qualitative image similarities.

TITLE: Magnetic resonance imaging-based partial volume-corrected 18F-sodium fluoride positron emission tomography in the femoral neck

AUTHORS: Cyrus Ayubcha, William Y Raynor, Austin J Borja, Siavash M Seraj, Chaitanya Rojulpote, Thomas J Werner, Mona-Elisabeth Revheim, Chamith S Rajapakse, Abass Alavi

JOURNAL: Nuclear medicine communications

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Objectives: 18F-sodium fluoride (NaF) is a radiotracer used in PET that reflects calcium metabolism and osteoblastic activity. In this study, we assessed the construct validity of a novel application of global assessment to measure NaF uptake in the femoral neck as a method of evaluating physiologic changes in osteoblastic metabolism with age.

Methods: Whole-body NaF-PET/computed tomography (CT) images and MRI of 24 male patients with a history of nonmetastatic prostate cancer between the ages of 36 and 82 years (67.8 ± 9.6) were analyzed. A region of interest delineated the entire femoral neck on the PET/CT image to determine the mean standardized uptake value (SUVmean). Correction for the partial volume effect was performed by measuring the volume of inert yellow bone marrow by MRI segmentation. Multiple linear regression was used to assess the relationship of uptake with age and body weight.

Results: The SUVmean with and without partial volume correction decreased with respect to age (P = 0.001 and P = 0.002, respectively). Body weight was not significantly related to any measured PET parameter.

Conclusion: Our results support the use of global NaF uptake with magnetic resonance-derived partial volume correction in the femoral neck. Because osteoblastic metabolism is known to decrease with normal aging, the observed decrease in NaF uptake constitutes evidence for convergent validity, indicating that the proposed methodology likely reflects systemic osteoblastic activity. Future studies of this methodology are warranted in other instances of varying osteoblastic activity such as in metabolic bone diseases and for the evaluation of therapy targeting osteoblastic metabolism.

TITLE: Assessing PET Parameters in Oncologic 18F-FDG Studies

AUTHORS: Ismet Sarikaya, Ali Sarikaya

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear medicine technology

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
PET imaging, particularly oncologic applications of18F-FDG, has become a routine diagnostic study. To better describe malignancies, various PET parameters are used. In18F-FDG PET studies, SUVmaxis the most commonly used parameter to measure the metabolic activity of the tumor. In obese patients, SUV corrected by lean body mass (SUL), and in pediatric patients, SUV corrected by body surface area, are recommended. Metabolic tumor volume is an important parameter to determine the local and total tumor burden. Total lesion glycolysis (SUVmean× metabolic tumor volume) provides information about averages. Some treatment response assessment protocols recommend using the SUVpeakor SULpeakof the tumor. Tumor-to-liver ratio and tumor-to-blood-pool ratio are helpful when comparing studies for treatment response assessment. Dual-time-point PET imaging with retention index can help differentiate malignant from benign lesions and may help detect small lesions. Dynamic18F-FDG PET imaging and quantitative analysis can measure the metabolic, phosphorylation, and dephosphorylation rates of lesions but are mainly used for research purposes. In this article, we will review the currently available PET parameters in18F-FDG studies with their importance, uses, limitations, and reasons for erroneous results.

JOURNAL: Nuklearmedizin. Nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
To determine the value of radiomics data extraction from baseline 18F FDG PET/CT in the prediction of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) among patients with primary breast cancer (BC).We retrospectively evaluated 74 patients who underwent baseline 18F FDG PET/CT scans for BC evaluation between October 2020 and April 2022. Radiomics data extraction resulted in a total of 131 radiomic features from primary tumors. TILs status was defined based on histological analyses of surgical specimens and patients were categorized as having low TILs or moderate & high TILs. The relationships between TILs groups and tumor features, patient characteristics and molecular subtypes were examined. Features with a correlation coefficient of less than 0.6 were analyzed by logistic regression to create a predictive model. The diagnostic performance of the model was calculated via receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis.Menopausal status, histological grade, nuclear grade, and four radiomics features demonstrated significant differences between the two TILs groups. Multivariable logistic regression revealed that nuclear grade and three radiomics features (Morphological COMShift, GLCM Correlation, and GLSZM Small Zone Emphasis) were independently associated with TIL grouping. The diagnostic performance analysis of the model showed an AUC of 0.864 (95% CI: 0.776-0.953; p < 0.001). The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV and accuracy values of the model were 69.6%, 82.4%, 64%, 85.7% and 78.4%, respectivelyThe pathological TIL scores of BC patients can be predicted by using radiomics feature extraction from baseline 18F FDG PET/CT scans.

TITLE: Translating contrast enhanced computed tomography images to liver radioembolization dose distribution for more comprehensively indicating patients

AUTHORS: Brahim Mehadji, Carlos A Ruvalcaba, Andrew M Hernandez, Yasser G Abdelhafez, Roger Goldman, Emilie Roncali

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Objective.Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) is commonly used in the pre-treatment evaluation of liver Y-90 radioembolization feasibility. CECT provides detailed imaging of the liver and surrounding structures, allowing healthcare providers to assess the size, location, and characteristics of liver tumors prior to the treatment. Here we propose a method for translating CECT images to an expected dose distribution for tumor(s) and normal liver tissue.Approach.A pre-procedure CECT is used to obtain an iodine arterial-phase distribution by subtracting the non-contrast CT from the late arterial phase. The liver segments surrounding the targeted tumor are selected using Couinaud's method. The resolution of the resulting images is then degraded to match the resolution of the positron emission tomography (PET) images, which can image the Y-90 activity distribution post-treatment. The resulting images are then used in the same way as PET images to compute doses using the local deposition method. CECT images from three patients were used to test this method retrospectively and were compared with Y-90 PET-based dose distributions through dose volume histograms.Main results.Results show a concordance between predicted and delivered Y-90 dose distributions with less than 10% difference in terms of mean dose, for doses greater than 10% of the 98th percentile (D2%).Significance.CECT-derived predictions of Y-90 radioembolization dose distributions seem promising as a supplementary tool for physicians when assessing treatment feasibility. This dosimetry prediction method could provide a more comprehensive pre-treatment evaluation-offering greater insights than a basic assessment of tumor opacification on CT images.

ABSTRACT:
Lung cancer remains one of the most prevalent cancers globally and the leading cause of cancer-related deaths, accounting for nearly one-fifth of all cancer fatalities. Fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography ([18F]FDG PET/CT) plays a vital role in assessing lung cancer and managing disease progression. While traditional PET/CT imaging relies on qualitative analysis and basic quantitative parameters, radiomics offers a more advanced approach to analyzing tumor phenotypes. Recently, radiomics has gained attention for its potential to enhance the prognostic and diagnostic capabilities of [18F]FDG PET/CT in various cancers. This review explores the expanding role of [18F]FDG PET/CT-based radiomics, particularly when integrated with artificial intelligence (AI), in managing lung cancer, especially non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We review how radiomics and AI improve diagnostics, staging, tumor subtype identification, and molecular marker detection, which influence treatment decisions. Additionally, we address challenges in clinical integration, such as imaging protocol standardization, feature reproducibility, and the need for extensive prospective studies. Ultimately, radiomics and AI hold great promise for enabling more personalized and effective lung cancer treatments, potentially transforming disease management.

TITLE: Artificial intelligence based malignant lymphoma type prediction using enhanced super resolution image and hybrid feature extraction algorithm

AUTHORS: S K UmaMaheswaran, V Priyanka Brahmaiah, Chalumuru Suresh, S R Balaji, Faiyaz Ahmad

JOURNAL: Computers in biology and medicine

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
In the medical field, the most common and frequent type of blood cancer is lymphoma. Accurately predicting and early response to lymphoma treatment will be useful for initiating treatment plans to achieve a greater rate of cure or reduced risk of treatment-related morbidity and death. Numerous research studies have revealed several pre-treatment predictive variables, including age, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), Ann Arbor stage, and ECOG performance. The 18F-FDG PET imaging method makes it possible to assess human tissues' glycolytic activity at the cellular level. It has been extensively utilized for lymphoma staging and diagnosis. Its usefulness for evaluating the response to therapy in lymphoma patients has been demonstrated in a number of promising investigations. However, target training data are typically insufficient for deep neural network training in outcome prediction tasks, making it challenging to provide accurate prediction. Thus, the ensemble learning based target training model has been used with the hybrid feature extraction models, to train the model based on texture, colour and shape. The various types of malignant lymphoma images are gathered as a dataset and pre-processed using spatial image filtering procedures to remove specific unwanted spatial frequencies from an image. Contrast stretching is a technique used to enhance contrast in images and the NNU-Net has been employed to attain the super resolution images for learning in-depth information from the images. After pre-processing the images, the GLRLM, CLCM and HU-moment features extraction techniques are used for extracting the texture, shape and colour features from the images. In order to forecast the type of malignant lymphoma, the retrieved images are finally classified utilizing the Bi-LSTM, DBN, and RBFN by stacking and providing the gathered learning features from each algorithm to the Meta classifier. The proposed model's performance is compared with the most cutting-edge transfer learning techniques and validated using measures including classification Accuracy, Positive predictive value, Hit rate, Selectivity and NPV, whose values are 94.8 %, 91.0 %, 90.6 %, 93.30 % and 95.6 %. Thus, a malignant lymphoma type prediction based on an enhanced super resolution image and ensemble learning classifier outperforms the existing model.

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: To improve reproducibility and predictive performance of PET radiomic features in multicentric studies by cycle-consistent generative adversarial network (GAN) harmonization approaches.

Methods: GAN-harmonization was developed to harmonize whole-body PET scans to perform image style and texture translation between different centers and scanners. GAN-harmonization was evaluated by application to two retrospectively collected open datasets and different tasks. First, GAN-harmonization was performed on a dual-center lung cancer cohort (127 female, 138 male) where the reproducibility of radiomic features in healthy liver tissue was evaluated. Second, GAN-harmonization was applied to a head and neck cancer cohort (43 female, 154 male) acquired from three centers. Here, the clinical impact of GAN-harmonization was analyzed by predicting the development of distant metastases using a logistic regression model incorporating first-order statistics and texture features from baseline18F-FDG PET before and after harmonization.

Results: Image quality remained high (structural similarity: left kidney≥0.800, right kidney≥0.806, liver≥0.780, lung≥0.838, spleen≥0.793, whole-body≥0.832) after image harmonization across all utilized datasets. Using GAN-harmonization, inter-site reproducibility of radiomic features in healthy liver tissue increased at least by≥5 ± 14% (first-order),≥16 ± 7% (GLCM),≥19 ± 5% (GLRLM),≥16 ± 8% (GLSZM),≥17 ± 6% (GLDM), and≥23 ± 14% (NGTDM). In the head and neck cancer cohort, the outcome prediction improved from AUC 0.68 (95% CI 0.66-0.71) to AUC 0.73 (0.71-0.75) by application of GAN-harmonization.

Conclusions: GANs are capable of performing image harmonization and increase reproducibility and predictive performance of radiomic features derived from different centers and scanners.

TITLE: Cross-modality PET image synthesis for Parkinson's Disease diagnosis: a leap from [18F]FDG to [11C]CFT

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Dopamine transporter [11C]CFT PET is highly effective for diagnosing Parkinson's Disease (PD), whereas it is not widely available in most hospitals. To develop a deep learning framework to synthesize [11C]CFT PET images from real [18F]FDG PET images and leverage their cross-modal correlation to distinguish PD from normal control (NC).

Methods: We developed a deep learning framework to synthesize [11C]CFT PET images from real [18F]FDG PET images, and leveraged their cross-modal correlation to distinguish PD from NC. A total of 604 participants (274 with PD and 330 with NC) who underwent [11C]CFT and [18F]FDG PET scans were included. The quality of the synthetic [11C]CFT PET images was evaluated through quantitative comparison with the ground-truth images and radiologist visual assessment. The evaluations of PD diagnosis performance were conducted using biomarker-based quantitative analyses (using striatal binding ratios from synthetic [11C]CFT PET images) and the proposed PD classifier (incorporating both real [18F]FDG and synthetic [11C]CFT PET images).

Results: Visualization result shows that the synthetic [11C]CFT PET images resemble the real ones with no significant differences visible in the error maps. Quantitative evaluation demonstrated that synthetic [11C]CFT PET images exhibited a high peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR: 25.0-28.0) and structural similarity (SSIM: 0.87-0.96) across different unilateral striatal subregions. The radiologists achieved a diagnostic accuracy of 91.9% (± 2.02%) based on synthetic [11C]CFT PET images, while biomarker-based quantitative analysis of the posterior putamen yielded an AUC of 0.912 (95% CI, 0.889-0.936), and the proposed PD Classifier achieved an AUC of 0.937 (95% CI, 0.916-0.957).

Conclusion: By bridging the gap between [18F]FDG and [11C]CFT, our deep learning framework can significantly enhance PD diagnosis without the need for [11C]CFT tracers, thereby expanding the reach of advanced diagnostic tools to clinical settings where [11C]CFT PET imaging is inaccessible.

TITLE: A GPU-accelerated fully 3D OSEM image reconstruction for a high-resolution small animal PET scanner using dual-ended readout detectors

AUTHORS: Tianyi Zeng, Juan Gao, Dongfang Gao, Zhonghua Kuang, Ziru Sang, Xiaohui Wang, Lingzhi Hu, Qun Chen, Xu Chu, Dong Liang, Xin Liu, Yongfeng Yang, Hairong Zheng, Zhanli Hu

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
In this work, a GPU-accelerated fully 3D ordered-subset expectation maximization (OSEM) image reconstruction with point spread function (PSF) modeling was developed for a small animal PET scanner with a long axial field of view (FOV). Dual-ended readout detectors that provided high depth of interaction (DOI) resolution were used for the small animal PET scanner to simultaneously achieve uniform high spatial resolution and high sensitivity. First, we developed a novel sinogram generation method, in which the dimension of the sinogram was determined first and then an event was assigned to a few neighboring sinogram elements by using weights that are inversely proportional to the distance from the measured line of response (LOR) to the LOR of the sinogram elements. System geometric symmetry, precomputation of LOR-driven ray-tracing and texture memory were applied to accelerate the GPU-based reconstruction. We developed a spatially variant PSF model where the PSF parameters were obtained by using point source images measured at 18 positions in the FOV and a spatial invariant PSF model where the PSF parameters were obtained by using only one image measured at the center FOV. The performance of the image reconstruction method was evaluated by using simulated phantom data as well as phantom and in-vivo mouse data acquired on the scanner. The results showed that the proposed reconstruction method provided better spatial resolution, a higher contrast recovery coefficient and lower noise than the OSEM reconstruction and was more than 1000 times faster than the CPU-based reconstruction. The spatially variant PSF model did not result in any spatial resolution improvement compared to the spatial invariant PSF model, and thus, the latter that is much easier to implement in image reconstruction and can be used in a small animal PET scanner using detectors with very high DOI resolution. A whole body18F-FDG mouse image with high resolution and a high contrast to noise ratio was obtained by using the proposed reconstruction method.

TITLE: Clinical evaluation of deep learning-enhanced lymphoma pet imaging with accelerated acquisition

AUTHORS: Xu Li, Boyang Pan, Congxia Chen, Dongyue Yan, Zhenglin Pan, Tao Feng, Hui Liu, Nan-Jie Gong, Fugeng Liu

JOURNAL: Journal of applied clinical medical physics

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: This study aims to evaluate the clinical performance of a deep learning (DL)-enhanced two-fold accelerated PET imaging method in patients with lymphoma.

Methods: A total of 123 cases devoid of lymphoma underwent whole-body 18F-FDG-PET/CT scans to facilitate the development of an advanced SAU2Net model, which combines the advantages of U2Net and attention mechanism. This model integrated inputs from simulated 1/2-dose (0.07 mCi/kg) PET acquisition across multiple slices to generate an estimated standard dose (0.14 mCi/kg) PET scan. Additional 39 cases with confirmed lymphoma pathology were utilized to evaluate the model's clinical performance. Assessment criteria encompassed peak-signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index (SSIM), a 5-point Likert scale rated by two experienced physicians, SUV features, image noise in the liver, and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR). Diagnostic outcomes, including lesion numbers and Deauville score, were also compared.

Results: Images enhanced by the proposed DL method exhibited superior image quality (P < 0.001) in comparison to low-dose acquisition. Moreover, they illustrated equivalent image quality in terms of subjective image analysis and lesion maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) as compared to the standard acquisition method. A linear regression model with y = 1.017x + 0.110 () can be established between the enhanced scans and the standard acquisition for lesion SUVmax. With enhancement, increased signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), CNR, and reduced image noise were observed, surpassing those of the standard acquisition. DL-enhanced PET images got diagnostic results essentially equavalent to standard PET images according to two experienced readers.

Conclusion: The proposed DL method could facilitate a 50% reduction in PET imaging duration for lymphoma patients, while concurrently preserving image quality and diagnostic accuracy.

JOURNAL: Physica medica : PM : an international journal devoted to the applications of physics to medicine and biology : official journal of the Italian Association of Biomedical Physics (AIFB)

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: We aimed to investigate whether short dynamic PET imaging started at injection, complemented with routine clinical acquisition at 60-min post-injection (static), can achieve reliable kinetic analysis.

Methods: Dynamic and static 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) PET data were generated using realistic simulations to assess uncertainties due to statistical noise as well as bias. Following image reconstructions, kinetic parameters obtained from a 2-tissue-compartmental model (2TCM) were estimated, making use of the static image, and the time duration of dynamic PET data were incrementally shortened. We also investigated, in the first 2-min, different frame sampling rates, towards optimized dynamic PET imaging. Kinetic parameters from shortened dynamic datasets were additionally estimated for 9 patients (15 scans) with liver metastases of colorectal cancer, and were compared with those derived from full dynamic imaging using correlation and Passing-Bablok regression analyses.

Results: The results showed that by reduction of dynamic scan times from 60-min to as short as 5-min, while using static data at 60-min post-injection, bias and variability stayed comparable in estimated kinetic parameters. Early frame samplings of 5, 24 and 30 s yielded highest biases compared to other schemes. An early frame sampling of 10 s generally kept both bias and variability to a minimum. In clinical studies, strong correlation (r ≥ 0.97, P < 0.0001) existed between all kinetic parameters in full vs. shortened scan protocols.

Conclusions: Shortened 5-min dynamic scan, sampled as 12 × 10 + 6 × 30 s, followed by 3-min static image at 60-min post-injection, enables accurate and robust estimation of 2TCM parameters, while enabling generation of SUV estimates.

TITLE: The Use of Maximum-Intensity Projections and Deep Learning Adds Value to the Fully Automatic Segmentation of Lesions Avid for [18F]FDG and [68Ga]Ga-PSMA in PET/CT

AUTHORS: Cláudia S Constantino, Francisco P M Oliveira, Marisa Machado, Susana Vinga, Durval C Costa

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
This study investigated the added value of using maximum-intensity projection (MIP) images for fully automatic segmentation of lesions using deep learning (DL) in [18F]FDG and [68Ga]Ga-prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET/CT scans.Methods:We used 489 staging [18F]FDG PET/CT scans from patients diagnosed with melanoma, lymphoma, or lung cancer (391 scans for training and 98 for internal testing). As an external test set, 117 staging [18F]FDG PET/CT scans from lymphoma patients (another center, 2 scanners) were used. For [68Ga]Ga-PSMA, 355 whole-body [68Ga]Ga-PSMA PET/CT scans from patients with prostate cancer were used (285 scans for training and 70 scans for testing). All scans had corresponding expert-based segmentation (ground truth). Three approaches per radiopharmaceutical were used for fully automatic segmentation: 3-dimensional U-Net applied directly on PET images (standard-DL-based), 3-dimensional U-Net applied on multiangle MIP images (MIP-DL-based), and a combined approach (standard-DL+MIP-DL-based). The performance was evaluated in comparison with ground truth segmentation through lesion detection scores, voxelwise segmentation overlap metrics, and quantification of clinically relevant imaging features.Results:For [18F]FDG PET scans, the MIP-DL-based method showed a lower lesion false-discovery rate than did the standard-DL-based approach, although not significant in internal and external test sets. Sensitivity in lesion detection did not vary significantly, and a reduction in voxelwise metrics was observed (median Dice coefficient of 0.65 vs. 0.80 in the internal test set). Significantly increased performance was obtained with the combined approach in both test sets. In the internal test set, the median false-discovery rate was 0% (12% using the standard-DL), and a considerable increase in the agreement of lesion features was observed (intraclass correlation coefficient range, 0.42-0.94 for standard-DL-based and 0.80-0.94 for the combined approach). Similar results were observed in the external set. Regarding [68Ga]Ga-PSMA scans, there was no significant increase in the performance of MIP-DL-based and combined approaches compared with standard-DL, which was already outstanding in lesion detectability.Conclusion:Fully automatic segmentation of lesions in whole-body or total-body [18F]FDG PET/CT scans may benefit from the addition of the MIP-DL-based segmentation compared with the standard-DL-based method. It reduces the number of false-positive lesions and improves the patients' tumor burden quantification. In [68Ga]Ga-PSMA PET/CT scans, no benefits were observed compared with standard-DL-based segmentation.

TITLE: Deep learning-based multimodal image analysis for cervical cancer detection

AUTHORS: Yue Ming, Xiying Dong, Jihuai Zhao, Zefu Chen, Hao Wang, Nan Wu

JOURNAL: Methods (San Diego, Calif.)

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women, and its precise detection plays a critical role in disease treatment and prognosis prediction. Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography and computed tomography, i.e., FDG-PET/CT and PET/CT, have established roles with superior sensitivity and specificity in most cancer imaging applications. However, a typical FDG-PET/CT analysis involves the time-consuming process of interpreting hundreds of images, and the intense image screening work has greatly hindered clinicians. We propose a computer-aided deep learning-based framework to detect cervical cancer using multimodal medical images to increase the efficiency of clinical diagnosis. This framework has three components: image registration, multimodal image fusion, and lesion object detection. Compared to traditional approaches, our adaptive image fusion method fuses multimodal medical images. We discuss the performance of deep learning in each modality, and we conduct extensive experiments to compare the performance of different image fusion methods with some state-of-the-art (SOTA) object-detection deep learning-based methods in images with different modalities. Compared with PET, which has the highest recognition accuracy in single-modality images, the recognition accuracy of our proposed method on multiple object detection models is improved by an average of 6.06%. And compared with the best results of other multimodal fusion methods, our results have an average improvement of 8.9%.

TITLE: Optimizing MR-based attenuation correction in hybrid PET/MR using deep learning: validation with a flatbed insert and consistent patient positioning

AUTHORS: Hanzhong Wang, Yue Wang, Qiaoyi Xue, Yu Zhang, Xiaoya Qiao, Zengping Lin, Jiaxu Zheng, Zheng Zhang, Yang Yang, Min Zhang, Qiu Huang, Yanqi Huang, Tuoyu Cao, Jin Wang, Biao Li

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: To address the challenges of verifying MR-based attenuation correction (MRAC) in PET/MR due to CT positional mismatches and alignment issues, this study utilized a flatbed insert and arms-down positioning during PET/CT scans to achieve precise MR-CT matching for accurate MRAC evaluation.

Methods: A validation dataset of 21 patients underwent whole-body [18F]FDG PET/CT followed by [18F]FDG PET/MR. A flatbed insert ensured consistent positioning, allowing direct comparison of four MRAC methods-four-tissue and five-tissue models with discrete and continuous μ-maps-against CT-based attenuation correction (CTAC). A deep learning-based framework, trained on a dataset of 300 patients, was used to generate synthesized-CTs from MR images, forming the basis for all MRAC methods. Quantitative analyses were conducted at the whole-body, region of interest, and lesion levels, with lesion-distance analysis evaluating the impact of bone proximity on standardized uptake value (SUV) quantification.

Results: Distinct differences were observed among MRAC methods in spine and femur regions. Joint histogram analysis showed MRAC-4 (continuous μ-map) closely aligned with CTAC. Lesion-distance analysis revealed MRAC-4 minimized bone-induced SUV interference (r = 0.01, p = 0.8643). However, tissues prone to bone segmentation interference, such as the spine and liver, exhibited greater SUV variability and lower reproducibility in MRAC-4 compared to MRAC-2 (2D bone segmentation, discrete μ-map) and MRAC-3 (3D bone segmentation, discrete μ-map).

Conclusion: Using a flatbed insert, this study validated MRAC with high precision. Continuous μ-value MRAC method (MRAC-4) demonstrated superior accuracy and minimized bone-related SUV errors but faced challenges in reproducibility, particularly in bone-rich regions.

TITLE: A myocardial reorientation method based on feature point detection for quantitative analysis of PET myocardial perfusion imaging

AUTHORS: Fei Shang, Li Huo, Tan Gong, Peipei Wang, Ximin Shi, Xiaoying Tang, Shuai Liu

JOURNAL: Computer methods and programs in biomedicine

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Objective: Reorienting cardiac positron emission tomography (PET) images to the transaxial plane is essential for cardiac PET image analysis. This study aims to design a convolutional neural network (CNN) for automatic reorientation and evaluate its generalizability.

Methods: An artificial intelligence (AI) method integrating U-Net and the differentiable spatial to numeric transform module (DSNT-U) was proposed to automatically position three feature points (Papex, Pbase, and PRV), with these three points manually located by an experienced radiologist as the reference standard (RS). A second radiologist performed manual location for reproducibility evaluation. The DSNT-U, initially trained and tested on a [11C]acetate dataset (training/testing: 40/17), was further compared with a CNN-spatial transformer network (CNN-STN). The network fine-tuned with 4 subjects was tested on a [13N]ammonia dataset (n = 30). The performance of the DSNT-U was evaluated in terms of coordinates, volume, and quantitative indexes (pharmacokinetic parameters and total perfusion deficit).

Results: The proposed DSNT-U successfully achieved automatic myocardial reorientation for both [11C]acetate and [13N]ammonia datasets. For the former dataset, the intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) between the coordinates predicted by the DSNT-U and the RS exceeded 0.876. The average normalized mean squared error (NMSE) between the short-axis (SA) images obtained through DSNT-U-based reorientation and the reference SA images was 0.051 ± 0.043. For pharmacokinetic parameters, the R² between the DSNT-U and the RS was larger than 0.968. Compared with the CNN-STN, the DSNT-U demonstrated a higher ICC between the estimated rigid transformation parameters and the RS. After fine-tuning on the [13N]ammonia dataset, the average NMSE between the SA images reoriented by the DSNT-U and the reference SA images was 0.056 ± 0.046. The ICC between the total perfusion deficit (TPD) values computed from DSNT-U-derived images and the reference values was 0.981. Furthermore, no significant differences were observed in the performance of the DSNT-U prediction among subjects with different genders or varying myocardial perfusion defect (MPD) statuses.

Conclusions: The proposed DSNT-U can accurately position Papex, Pbase, and PRVon the [11C]acetate dataset. After fine-tuning, the positioning model can be applied to the [13N]ammonia perfusion dataset, demonstrating good generalization performance. This method can adapt to data of different genders (with or without MPD) and different tracers, displaying the potential to replace manual operations.

ABSTRACT:
Background: This study develops a deep learning-based automated lesion segmentation model for whole-body 3D18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-Position emission tomography (PET) with computed tomography (CT) images agnostic to disease location and site.

Method: A publicly available lesion-annotated dataset of 1014 whole-body FDG-PET/CT images was used to train, validate, and test (70:10:20) eight configurations with 3D U-Net as the backbone architecture. The best-performing model on the test set was further evaluated on 3 different unseen cohorts consisting of osteosarcoma or neuroblastoma (OS cohort) (n = 13), pediatric solid tumors (ST cohort) (n = 14), and adult Pheochromocytoma/Paraganglioma (PHEO cohort) (n = 40). Both lesion-level and patient-level statistical analyses were conducted to validate the performance of the model on different cohorts.

Results: The best performing 3D full resolution nnUNet model achieved a lesion-level sensitivity and DISC of 71.70 % and 0.40 for the test set, 97.83 % and 0.73 for ST, 40.15 % and 0.36 for OS, and 78.37 % and 0.50 for the PHEO cohort. For the test set and PHEO cohort, the model has missed small volume and lower uptake lesions (p < 0.01), whereas no statistically significant differences (p > 0.05) were found in the false positive (FP) and false negative lesions volume and uptake for the OS and ST cohort. The predicted total lesion glycolysis is slightly higher than the ground truth because of FP calls, which experts can easily check and reject.

Conclusion: The developed deep learning-based automated lesion segmentation AI model which utilizes 3D_FullRes configuration of the nnUNet framework showed promising and reliable performance for the whole-body FDG-PET/CT images.

JOURNAL: Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
We present a novel method for estimating respiratory motion using inertial measurement units (IMUs) based on microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technology. As an application of the method we consider the amplitude gating of positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, and compare the method against a clinically used respiration motion estimation technique. The presented method can be used to detect respiratory cycles and estimate their lengths with state-of-the-art accuracy when compared to other IMU-based methods, and is the first based on commercial MEMS devices, which can estimate quantitatively both the magnitude and the phase of respiratory motion from the abdomen and chest regions. For the considered test group consisting of eight subjects with acute myocardial infarction, our method achieved the absolute breathing rate error per minute of 0.44 ± 0.23 1/min, and the absolute amplitude error of 0.24 ± 0.09 cm, when compared to the clinically used respiratory motion estimation technique. The presented method could be used to simplify the logistics related to respiratory motion estimation in PET imaging studies, and also to enable multi-position motion measurements for advanced organ motion estimation.

TITLE: Evaluation of a motion correction algorithm in lung cancer PET/CT: Phantom validation and patient studies

AUTHORS: Ziyang Wang, Jianjing Liu, Di Lu, Guoqing Sui, Yaya Wang, Lina Tong, Xueyao Liu, Yan Zhang, Jie Fu, Wengui Xu, Dong Dai

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Background: Data-driven gating (DDG) is an emerging technology that can reduce the respiratory motion artifacts in positron emission tomography (PET) images.

Purpose: The aim of this study is to use phantom and patient data to validate the performance of DDG with a motion correction algorithm based on the reconstruct, register, and average (RRA) method.

Methods: A customized motion platform drove the phantom (five spheres with diameters of 10-28 mm) using a periodic motion that had a duration of 3-5 s and amplitudes of 2-4 cm. Normalized ratio of ungated and RRA PET relative to the ground-truth static PET was calculated for RSUVmax, RSUVmean, RSUVpeak, RVolume, and relative contrast-to-noise ratio (RCNR). Additionally, 30 lung cancer patients with 76 lung lesions less than 3 cm in diameter were prospectively studied. The overall image quality of patient examination was scored using a 5-point scale by two radiologists. SUVmax, SUVmean, SUVpeak, volume, and CNR of lesions measured in ungated and RRA PET were compared, and subgroup analysis was conducted.

Results: In RRA PET images, motion artifacts of the spheres in the phantom were effectively mitigated, regardless of changes in movement amplitudes or duration. For all spheres with different ranges of motion and cycles, RSUVmax, RSUVmean, RSUVpeak, and RCNR increased significantly (p ≤ 0.001) and RVolume decreased significantly (p < 0.001) in RRA PET images. The average radiologist scores of image quality were 3.90 ± 0.86 with RRA PET, and 3.03 ± 1.19 with ungated PET. In RRA PET images, the SUVmax (p < 0.001), SUVmean (p < 0.001), SUVpeak (p < 0.001), and CNR (p < 0.001) of the lesions increased, while the volume (p < 0.001) of the lesions decreased. Δ%SUVmax, Δ%SUVmean, Δ%SUVpeak, and Δ%CNR of the lesions increased by 3.9%, 6.5%, 5.6%, and 4.3%, respectively, while Δ%Volume of the lesions decreased by 18.4%. Subgroup analysis showed that in lesions in the upper and middle lobes, only SUVpeak (p < 0.001) significantly increased by 5.6% in RRA PET, while their volume (p < 0.001) notably decreased by 12.4% (p < 0.001).

Conclusion: DDG integrated with RRA motion correction algorithm can effectively mitigate motion artifacts, thus enhancing the quantification accuracy and visual quality of images in lung cancer PET/CT.

Objectives: PET/CT is a first-line tool for the diagnosis of lung cancer. The accuracy of quantification may suffer from various factors throughout the acquisition process. The dynamic PET parametric Kiprovides better quantification and improve specificity for cancer detection. However, parametric imaging is difficult to implement clinically due to the long acquisition time (~ 1 h). We propose a dynamic parametric imaging method based on conventional static PET using deep learning.

Methods: Based on the imaging data of 203 participants, an improved cycle generative adversarial network incorporated with squeeze-and-excitation attention block was introduced to learn the potential mapping relationship between static PET and Kiparametric images. The image quality of the synthesized images was qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated by using several physical and clinical metrics. Statistical analysis of correlation and consistency was also performed on the synthetic images.

Results: Compared with those of other networks, the images synthesized by our proposed network exhibited superior performance in both qualitative and quantitative evaluation, statistical analysis, and clinical scoring. Our synthesized Kiimages had significant correlation (Pearson correlation coefficient, 0.93), consistency, and excellent quantitative evaluation results with the Kiimages obtained in standard dynamic PET practice.

Conclusions: Our proposed deep learning method can be used to synthesize highly correlated and consistent dynamic parametric images obtained from static lung PET.

Key points: • Compared with conventional static PET, dynamic PET parametric Kiimaging has been shown to provide better quantification and improved specificity for cancer detection. • The purpose of this work was to develop a dynamic parametric imaging method based on static PET images using deep learning. • Our proposed network can synthesize highly correlated and consistent dynamic parametric images, providing an additional quantitative diagnostic reference for clinicians.

TITLE: Direct inference of Patlak parametric images in whole-body PET/CT imaging using convolutional neural networks

AUTHORS: Neda Zaker, Kamal Haddad, Reza Faghihi, Hossein Arabi, Habib Zaidi

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: This study proposed and investigated the feasibility of estimating Patlak-derived influx rate constant (Ki) from standardized uptake value (SUV) and/or dynamic PET image series.

Methods: Whole-body18F-FDG dynamic PET images of 19 subjects consisting of 13 frames or passes were employed for training a residual deep learning model with SUV and/or dynamic series as input and Ki-Patlak (slope) images as output. The training and evaluation were performed using a nine-fold cross-validation scheme. Owing to the availability of SUV images acquired 60 min post-injection (20 min total acquisition time), the data sets used for the training of the models were split into two groups: "With SUV" and "Without SUV." For "With SUV" group, the model was first trained using only SUV images and then the passes (starting from pass 13, the last pass, to pass 9) were added to the training of the model (one pass each time). For this group, 6 models were developed with input data consisting of SUV, SUV plus pass 13, SUV plus passes 13 and 12, SUV plus passes 13 to 11, SUV plus passes 13 to 10, and SUV plus passes 13 to 9. For the "Without SUV" group, the same trend was followed, but without using the SUV images (5 models were developed with input data of passes 13 to 9). For model performance evaluation, the mean absolute error (MAE), mean error (ME), mean relative absolute error (MRAE%), relative error (RE%), mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), and structural similarity index (SSIM) were calculated between the predicted Ki-Patlak images by the two groups and the reference Ki-Patlak images generated through Patlak analysis using the whole acquired data sets. For specific evaluation of the method, regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn on representative organs, including the lung, liver, brain, and heart and around the identified malignant lesions.

Results: The MRAE%, RE%, PSNR, and SSIM indices across all patients were estimated as 7.45 ± 0.94%, 4.54 ± 2.93%, 46.89 ± 2.93, and 1.00 ± 6.7 × 10-7, respectively, for models predicted using SUV plus passes 13 to 9 as input. The predicted parameters using passes 13 to 11 as input exhibited almost similar results compared to the predicted models using SUV plus passes 13 to 9 as input. Yet, the bias was continuously reduced by adding passes until pass 11, after which the magnitude of error reduction was negligible. Hence, the predicted model with SUV plus passes 13 to 9 had the lowest quantification bias. Lesions invisible in one or both of SUV and Ki-Patlak images appeared similarly through visual inspection in the predicted images with tolerable bias.

Conclusion: This study concluded the feasibility of direct deep learning-based approach to estimate Ki-Patlak parametric maps without requiring the input function and with a fewer number of passes. This would lead to shorter acquisition times for WB dynamic imaging with acceptable bias and comparable lesion detectability performance.

TITLE: Efficient model-informed co-segmentation of tumors on PET/CT driven by clustering and classification information

AUTHORS: Laquan Li, Chuangbo Jiang, Lei Yu, Xianhua Zeng, Shenhai Zheng

JOURNAL: Computers in biology and medicine

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Automatic tumor segmentation via positron emission tomography (PET) and computed tomography (CT) images plays a critical role in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of this disease via radiation oncology. However, segmenting these tumors is challenging due to the heterogeneity of grayscale levels and fuzzy boundaries. To address these issues, in this paper, an efficient model-informed PET/CT tumor co-segmentation method that combines fuzzy C-means clustering and Bayesian classification information is proposed. To alleviate the grayscale heterogeneity of multi-modal images, in this method, a novel grayscale similar region term is designed based on the background region information of PET and the foreground region information of CT. An edge stop function is innovatively presented to enhance the localization of fuzzy edges by incorporating the fuzzy C-means clustering strategy. To improve the segmentation accuracy further, a unique data fidelity term is introduced based on PET images by combining the distribution characteristics of pixel points in PET images. Finally, experimental validation on datasets of head and neck tumor (HECKTOR) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) demonstrated impressive values for three key evaluation metrics, including DSC, RVD and HD5, achieved impressive values of 0.85, 5.32, and 0.17, respectively. These compelling results indicate that image segmentation methods based on mathematical models exhibit outstanding performance in handling grayscale heterogeneity and fuzzy boundaries in multi-modal images.

TITLE: Robustness of [18F]FDG PET/CT radiomic analysis in the setting of drug-induced cardiotoxicity

AUTHORS: David Palomino-Fernández, Alexander P Seiffert, Adolfo Gómez-Grande, Carmen Jiménez López-Guarch, Guillermo Moreno, Héctor Bueno, Enrique J Gómez, Patricia Sánchez-González

JOURNAL: Computer methods and programs in biomedicine

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Background and objectives: Standardization of radiomic data acquisition protocols is still at a very early stage, revealing a strong need to work towards the definition of uniform image processing methodologies The aim of this study is to identify sources of variability in radiomic data derived from image discretization and resampling methodologies prior to image feature extraction. Furthermore, to identify robust potential image-based biomarkers for the early detection of cardiotoxicity.

Methods: Image post-acquisition processing, interpolation, and volume of interest (VOI) segmentation were performed. Four experiments were conducted to assess the reliability in terms of the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of the radiomic features and the effects of the variation of voxel size and gray level discretization. Statistical analysis was performed separating the patients according to cardiotoxicity diagnosis. Differences of texture features were studied with Mann-Whitney U test. P-values <0.05 after multiple testing correction were considered statistically significant. Additionally, a non-supervised k-Means clustering algorithm was evaluated.

Results: The effect of the variation in the voxel size demonstrated a non-dependency relationship with the values of the radiomic features, regardless of the chosen discretization method. The median ICC values were 0.306 and 0.872 for absolute agreement and consistency, respectively, when varying the discretization bin number. The median ICC values were 0.678 and 0.878 for absolute agreement and consistency, respectively, when varying the discretization bin size. A total of 16 first order, 6 Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM), 4 Gray Level Dependence Matrix (GLDM) and 4 Gray Level Run Length Matrix (GLRLM) features demonstrated statistically significant differences between the diagnosis groups for interim scans (P<0.05) for the fixed bin size (FBS) discretization methodology. However, no statistically significant differences between diagnostic groups were found for the fixed bin number (FBN) discretization methodology. Two clusters based on the radiomic features were identified.

Conclusions: Gray level discretization has a major impact on the repeatability of the radiomic features. The selection of the optimal processing methodology has led to the identification of texture-based patterns for the differentiation of early cardiac damage profiles.

TITLE: Improved Correlation of 18F-Flortaucipir PET SUVRs and Clinical Stages in the Alzheimer Disease Continuum with the MUBADA/PERSI-Based Analysis

AUTHORS: Yasuhiko Ikari, Go Akamatsu, Keiichi Matsumoto, Tomohiko Yamane, Michio Senda, Kazuki Fukuchi, AMED Preclinical AD Study Investigators, and Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative Investigators

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear medicine technology

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
The Alzheimer disease (AD) continuum is a neurodegenerative disorder with cognitive decline and pathologic changes. Tau PET imaging can detect tau pathology, and18F-flortaucipir PET imaging is expected to visualize progression through the stages of AD, for which quantitative assessment is essential. Two measurement methods, statistically defined multiblock barycentric discriminant analysis (MUBADA)/parametric estimation of reference signal intensity (PERSI) and anatomically defined tau meta-volume of interest (VOI)/cerebellar gray matter (CGM) for SUV ratio (SUVR), were compared in this study to assess their relationship to AD clinical stage using 2 open multicenter PET databases.Methods:Data were selected for 106 cases from 2 databases, AMED Preclinical AD study (AMED-PRE) (n= 15) and Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 3 (n= 91). The data of the participants were categorized into 4 groups based on the clinical criteria. Tau PET imaging was conducted using18F-flortaucipir, and the 2 SUVR measurement methods, MUBADA/PERSI and tau meta-VOI/CGM, were compared among different clinical categories: amyloid-negative cognitively normal, preclinical AD, amyloid-negative mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and amyloid-positive MCI.Results:Significant differences were found between cognitively normal and preclinical AD, as well as between cognitively normal and amyloid-positive MCI and between amyloid-negative MCI and -positive MCI in SUVR derived by MUBADA/PERSI, whereas SUVR by tau meta-VOI/CGM did not provide significant differences between any pair. The tau meta-VOI/CGM method consistently provided higher SUVRs and larger individual variations than MUBADA/PERSI, with a mean SUVR difference of 0.136 for the studied databases.Conclusion:MUBADA/PERSI provided the SUVR of18F-flortaucipir uptake with better association with the clinical severity of the AD continuum and with smaller variability. The results support the usefulness of MUBADA/PERSI as a quantitative measure of18F-flortaucipir uptake in multicenter studies using different PET systems and scanning methods. However, limitations of the study include the small sample size and the unbalanced distribution among clinical categories in the AMED Preclinical AD study database.

TITLE: MRLA-Net: A tumor segmentation network embedded with a multiple receptive-field lesion attention module in PET-CT images

AUTHORS: Yang Zhou, Huiyan Jiang, Zhaoshuo Diao, Guoyu Tong, Qiu Luan, Yaming Li, Xuena Li

JOURNAL: Computers in biology and medicine

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
The tumor image segmentation is an important basis for doctors to diagnose and formulate treatment planning. PET-CT is an extremely important technology for recognizing the systemic situation of diseases due to the complementary advantages of their respective modal information. However, current PET-CT tumor segmentation methods generally focus on the fusion of PET and CT features. The fusion of features will weaken the characteristics of the modality itself. Therefore, enhancing the modal features of the lesions can obtain optimized feature sets, which is extremely necessary to improve the segmentation results. This paper proposed an attention module that integrates the PET-CT diagnostic visual field and the modality characteristics of the lesion, that is, the multiple receptive-field lesion attention module. This paper made full use of the spatial domain, frequency domain, and channel attention, and proposed a large receptive-field lesion localization module and a small receptive-field lesion enhancement module, which together constitute the multiple receptive-field lesion attention module. In addition, a network embedded with a multiple receptive-field lesion attention module has been proposed for tumor segmentation. This paper conducted experiments on a private liver tumor dataset as well as two publicly available datasets, the soft tissue sarcoma dataset, and the head and neck tumor segmentation dataset. The experimental results showed that the proposed method achieves excellent performance on multiple datasets, and has a significant improvement compared with DenseUNet, and the tumor segmentation results on the above three PET/CT datasets were improved by 7.25%, 6.5%, 5.29% in Dice per case. Compared with the latest PET-CT liver tumor segmentation research, the proposed method improves by 8.32%.

TITLE: Enhancing voxel-based dosimetry accuracy with an unsupervised deep learning approach for hybrid medical image registration

AUTHORS: Keon Min Kim, Minseok Suh, Haniff Shazwan Muhd Safwan Selvam, Teik Hin Tan, Gi Jeong Cheon, Keon Wook Kang, Jae Sung Lee

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Background: Deformable registration is required to generate a time-integrated activity (TIA) map which is essential for voxel-based dosimetry. The conventional iterative registration algorithm using anatomical images (e.g., computed tomography (CT)) could result in registration errors in functional images (e.g., single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) or positron emission tomography (PET)). Various deep learning-based registration tools have been proposed, but studies specifically focused on the registration of serial hybrid images were not found.

Purpose: In this study, we introduce CoRX-NET, a novel unsupervised deep learning network designed for deformable registration of hybrid medical images. The CoRX-NET structure is based on the Swin-transformer (ST), allowing for the representation of complex spatial connections in images. Its self-attention mechanism aids in the effective exchange and integration of information across diverse image regions. To augment the amalgamation of SPECT and CT features, cross-stitch layers have been integrated into the network.

Methods: Two different177Lu DOTATATE SPECT/CT datasets were acquired at different medical centers. 22 sets from Seoul National University and 14 sets from Sunway Medical Centre are used for training/internal validation and external validation respectively. The CoRX-NET architecture builds upon the ST, enabling the modeling of intricate spatial relationships within images. To further enhance the fusion of SPECT and CT features, cross-stitch layers have been incorporated within the network. The network takes a pair of SPECT/CT images (e.g., fixed and moving images) and generates a deformed SPECT/CT image. The performance of the network was compared with Elastix and TransMorph using L1 loss and structural similarity index measure (SSIM) of CT, SSIM of normalized SPECT, and local normalized cross correlation (LNCC) of SPECT as metrics. The voxel-wise root mean square errors (RMSE) of TIA were compared among the different methods.

Results: The ablation study revealed that cross-stitch layers improved SPECT/CT registration performance. The cross-stitch layers notably enhance SSIM (internal validation: 0.9614 vs. 0.9653, external validation: 0.9159 vs. 0.9189) and LNCC of normalized SPECT images (internal validation: 0.7512 vs. 0.7670, external validation: 0.8027 vs. 0.8027). CoRX-NET with the cross-stitch layer achieved superior performance metrics compared to Elastix and TransMorph, except for CT SSIM in the external dataset. When qualitatively analyzed for both internal and external validation cases, CoRX-NET consistently demonstrated superior SPECT registration results. In addition, CoRX-NET accomplished SPECT/CT image registration in less than 6 s, whereas Elastix required approximately 50 s using the same PC's CPU. When employing CoRX-NET, it was observed that the voxel-wise RMSE values for TIA were approximately 27% lower for the kidney and 33% lower for the tumor, compared to when Elastix was used.

Conclusion: This study represents a major advancement in achieving precise SPECT/CT registration using an unsupervised deep learning network. It outperforms conventional methods like Elastix and TransMorph, reducing uncertainties in TIA maps for more accurate dose assessments.

TITLE: Physically informed deep neural networks for metabolite-corrected plasma input function estimation in dynamic PET imaging

AUTHORS: Matteo Ferrante, Marianna Inglese, Ludovica Brusaferri, Alexander C Whitehead, Lucia Maccioni, Federico E Turkheimer, Maria A Nettis, Valeria Mondelli, Oliver Howes, Marco L Loggia, Mattia Veronese, Nicola Toschi

JOURNAL: Computer methods and programs in biomedicine

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Introduction: We propose a novel approach for the non-invasive quantification of dynamic PET imaging data, focusing on the arterial input function (AIF) without the need for invasive arterial cannulation.

Methods: Our method utilizes a combination of three-dimensional depth-wise separable convolutional layers and a physically informed deep neural network to incorporatea priori knowledge about the AIF's functional form and shape, enabling precise predictions of the concentrations of [11C]PBR28 in whole blood and the free tracer in metabolite-corrected plasma.

Results: We found a robust linear correlation between our model's predicted AIF curves and those obtained through traditional, invasive measurements. We achieved an average cross-validated Pearson correlation of 0.86 for whole blood and 0.89 for parent plasma curves. Moreover, our method's ability to estimate the volumes of distribution across several key brain regions - without significant differences between the use of predicted versus actual AIFs in a two-tissue compartmental model - successfully captures the intrinsic variability related to sex, the binding affinity of the translocator protein (18 kDa), and age.

Conclusions: These results not only validate our method's accuracy and reliability but also establish a foundation for a streamlined, non-invasive approach to dynamic PET data quantification. By offering a precise and less invasive alternative to traditional quantification methods, our technique holds significant promise for expanding the applicability of PET imaging across a wider range of tracers, thereby enhancing its utility in both clinical research and diagnostic settings.

TITLE: Locally Adaptive Total p-Variation Regularization for Non-Rigid Image Registration With Sliding Motion

AUTHORS: Lun Gong, Luwen Duan, Yakang Dai, Qi He, Siyang Zuo, Tianxiao Fu, Xiaodong Yang, Jian Zheng

JOURNAL: IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Due to the complicated thoracic movements which contain both sliding motion occurring at lung surfaces and smooth motion within individual organs, respiratory estimation is still an intrinsically challenging task. In this paper, we propose a novel regularization term called locally adaptive total p-variation (LaTpV) and embed it into a parametric registration framework to accurately recover lung motion. LaTpV originates from a modified Lp-norm constraint (1 < p < 2), where a prior distribution of p modeled by the Dirac-shaped function is constructed to specifically assign different values to voxels. LaTpV adaptively balances the smoothness and discontinuity of the displacement field to encourage an expected sliding interface. Additionally, we also analytically deduce the gradient of the cost function with respect to transformation parameters. To validate the performance of LaTpV, we not only test it on two mono-modal databases including synthetic images and pulmonary computed tomography (CT) images, but also on a more difficult thoracic CT and positron emission tomography (PET) dataset for the first time. For all experiments, both the quantitative and qualitative results indicate that LaTpV significantly surpasses some existing regularizers such as bending energy and parametric total variation. The proposed LaTpV based registration scheme might be more superior for sliding motion correction and more potential for clinical applications such as the diagnosis of pleural mesothelioma and the adjustment of radiotherapy plans.

TITLE: Uncertainty quantification for deep learning-based metastatic lesion segmentation on whole body PET/CT

AUTHORS: Brayden Schott, Victor Santoro-Fernandes, Žan Klaneček, Scott Perlman, Robert Jeraj

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Objective.Deep learning models are increasingly being implemented for automated medical image analysis to inform patient care. Most models, however, lack uncertainty information, without which the reliability of model outputs cannot be ensured. Several uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods exist to capture model uncertainty. Yet, it is not clear which method is optimal for a given task. The purpose of this work was to investigate several commonly used UQ methods for the critical yet understudied task of metastatic lesion segmentation on whole body PET/CT.Approach.59 whole body68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT images of patients undergoing theranostic treatment of metastatic neuroendocrine tumors were used in this work. A 3D U-Net was trained for lesion segmentation following five-fold cross validation. Uncertainty measures derived from four UQ methods-probability entropy, Monte Carlo dropout, deep ensembles, and test time augmentation-were investigated. Each uncertainty measure was assessed across four quantitative evaluations: (1) its ability to detect artificially degraded image data at low, medium, and high degradation magnitudes; (2) to detect false-positive (FP) predicted regions; (3) to recover false-negative (FN) predicted regions; and (4) to establish correlations with model biomarker extraction and segmentation performance metrics.Mainresults.Test time augmentation and probability entropy respectively achieved the highest and lowest degraded image detection at low (AUC = 0.54 vs. 0.68), medium (AUC = 0.70 vs. 0.82), and high (AUC = 0.83 vs. 0.90) degradation magnitudes. For detecting FPs, all UQ methods achieve strong performance, with AUC values ranging narrowly between 0.77 and 0.81. FN region recovery performance was strongest for test time augmentation and weakest for probability entropy. Performance for the correlation analysis was mixed, where the strongest performance was achieved by test time augmentation for SUVtotalcapture (ρ= 0.57) and segmentation Dice coefficient (ρ= 0.72), by Monte Carlo dropout for SUVmeancapture (ρ= 0.35), and by probability entropy for segmentation cross entropy (ρ= 0.96).Significance.Overall, test time augmentation demonstrated superior UQ performance and is recommended for use in metastatic lesion segmentation task. It also offers the advantage of being post hoc and computationally efficient. In contrast, probability entropy performed the worst, highlighting the need for advanced UQ approaches for this task.

ABSTRACT:
The numerous and varied forms of neurodegenerative illnesses provide a considerable challenge to contemporary healthcare. The emergence of artificial intelligence has fundamentally changed the diagnostic picture by providing effective and early means of identifying these crippling illnesses. As a subset of computational intelligence, machine-learning algorithms have become very effective tools for the analysis of large datasets that include genetic, imaging, and clinical data. Moreover, multi-modal data integration, which includes information from brain imaging (MRI, PET scans), genetic profiles, and clinical evaluations, is made easier by computational intelligence. A thorough knowledge of the course of the illness is made possible by this consolidative method, which also facilitates the creation of predictive models for early medical evaluation and outcome prediction. Furthermore, there has been a great deal of promise shown by the use of artificial intelligence to neuroimaging analysis. Sophisticated image processing methods combined with machine learning algorithms make it possible to identify functional and structural anomalies in the brain, which often act as early indicators of neurodegenerative diseases. This chapter examines how computational intelligence plays a critical role in improving the diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, etc. To sum up, computational intelligence provides a revolutionary approach for improving the identification of neurodegenerative illnesses. In the battle against these difficult disorders, embracing and improving these computational techniques will surely pave the path for more individualized therapy and more therapies that are successful.

TITLE: Deep-learning-based estimation of attenuation map improves attenuation correction performance over direct attenuation estimation for myocardial perfusion SPECT

AUTHORS: Yu Du, Jingjie Shang, Jingzhang Sun, Lu Wang, Yi-Hwa Liu, Hao Xu, Greta S P Mok

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear cardiology : official publication of the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Background: Deep learning (DL)-based attenuation correction (AC) is promising to improve myocardial perfusion (MP) SPECT. We aimed to optimize and compare the DL-based direct and indirect AC methods, with and without SPECT and CT mismatch.

Methods: One hundred patients with different99mTc-sestamibi activity distributions and anatomical variations were simulated by a population of XCAT phantoms. Additionally, 34 patients99mTc-sestamibi stress/rest SPECT/CT scans were retrospectively recruited. Projections were reconstructed by OS-EM method with or without AC. Mismatch between SPECT and CT images was modeled. A 3D conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) was optimized for two DL-based AC methods: (i) indirect approach, i.e., non-attenuation corrected (NAC) SPECT paired with the corresponding attenuation map for training. The projections were reconstructed with the DL-generated attenuation map for AC; (ii) direct approach, i.e., NAC SPECT paired with the corresponding AC SPECT for training to perform direct AC.

Results: Mismatch between SPECT and CT degraded DL-based AC performance. The indirect approach is superior to direct approach for various physical and clinical indices, even with mismatch modeled.

Conclusion: DL-based estimation of attenuation map for AC is superior and more robust to direct generation of AC SPECT.

ABSTRACT:
A standardized approach to acquiring amyloid PET images increases their value as disease and drug response biomarkers. Most18F PET amyloid brain scans often are assessed only visually (per regulatory labels), with a binary decision indicating the presence or absence of Alzheimer disease amyloid pathology. Minimizing technical variance allows precise, quantitative SUV ratios (SUVRs) for early detection of β-amyloid plaques and allows the effectiveness of antiamyloid treatments to be assessed with serial studies.Methods:The Quantitative Imaging Biomarkers Alliance amyloid PET biomarker committee developed and validated a profile to characterize and reduce the variability of SUVRs, increasing statistical power for these assessments.Results:On achieving conformance, sites can justify a claim that brain amyloid burden reflected by the SUVR is measurable to a within-subject coefficient of variation of no more than 1.94% when the same radiopharmaceutical, scanner, acquisition, and analysis protocols are used.Conclusion:This overview explains the claim, requirements, barriers, and potential future developments of the profile to achieve precision in clinical and research amyloid PET imaging.

TITLE: Lesion detection in 18F-sodium fluoride bone imaging: a comparison of attenuation-corrected versus nonattenuation-corrected PET reconstructions from modern PET-CT systems

AUTHORS: Natalie Anne Bebbington, Helle Damgaard Zacho, Paw Christian Holdgaard

JOURNAL: Nuclear medicine communications

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Objectives: An earlier study demonstrated comparable lesion detection between attenuation-corrected (AC) and nonattenuation-corrected (NAC) 18F-sodium fluoride (NaF) PET images, which is relevant for computed tomography (CT) radiation dose-saving. However, this finding may not be applicable to newer systems. The aim was to compare lesion detection between AC and NAC NaF PET images on modern PET-CT systems.

Methods: One expert and one nonexpert observer retrospectively surveyed NaF PET data in 25 breast cancer patients. At both lesion and patient level, each observer classified bone abnormalities as malignant, equivocal or benign, from NAC and AC PET images in the absence of CT. Expert interpretation of NaF PET-CT with the review of all diagnostic imaging/pathology reports for at least the subsequent 12 months provided reference standard metastases status at the patient level. Two-tailed Wilcoxon signed-rank tests measured statistically significant differences in total lesion detection between AC and NAC PET. Quadratic-weighted kappa score measured agreement in patient metastases status between observers.

Results: On a lesion-basis, AC PET images showed significantly more lesions than NAC for both the expert (122 versus 96; P = 0.002) and nonexpert (146 versus 132; P = 0.036) observers, with a large number of patients demonstrating disparity between AC and NAC images. For metastases status at the patient level without CT, NAC PET showed slightly better diagnostic accuracy than AC due to fewer false-positive results, as fewer lesions were identified.

Conclusion: AC PET data provided superior lesion detection to NAC in NaF bone examinations and are thus required for clinical interpretation.

TITLE: AW-SDRLSE: Adaptive Weighting and Scalable Distance Regularized Level Set Evolution for Lymphoma Segmentation on PET Images

AUTHORS: Siqi Li, Huiyan Jiang, Haoming Li, Yu-Dong Yao

JOURNAL: IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Accurate lymphoma segmentation on Positron Emission Tomography (PET) images is of great importance for medical diagnoses, such as for distinguishing benign and malignant. To this end, this paper proposes an adaptive weighting and scalable distance regularized level set evolution (AW-SDRLSE) method for delineating lymphoma boundaries on 2D PET slices. There are three important characteristics with respect to AW-SDRLSE: 1) A scalable distance regularization term is proposed and a parameter q can control the contour's convergence rate and precision in theory. 2) A novel dynamic annular mask is proposed to calculate mean intensities of local interior and exterior regions and further define the region energy term. 3) As the level set method is sensitive to parameters, we thus propose an adaptive weighting strategy for the length and area energy terms using local region intensity and boundary direction information. AW-SDRLSE is evaluated on 90 cases of real PET data with a mean Dice coefficient of 0.8796. Comparative results demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of AW-SDRLSE as well as its performance advantages as compared with related level set methods. In addition, experimental results indicate that AW-SDRLSE can be a fine segmentation method for improving the lymphoma segmentation results obtained by deep learning (DL) methods significantly.

TITLE: PSMA-Hornet: Fully-automated, multi-target segmentation of healthy organs in PSMA PET/CT images

AUTHORS: Ivan S Klyuzhin, Guillaume Chaussé, Ingrid Bloise, Sara Harsini, Juan Lavista Ferres, Carlos Uribe, Arman Rahmim

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Background: Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET imaging represents a valuable source of information reflecting disease stage, response rate, and treatment optimization options, particularly with PSMA radioligand therapy. Quantification of radiopharmaceutical uptake in healthy organs from PSMA images has the potential to minimize toxicity by extrapolation of the radiation dose delivery towards personalization of therapy. However, segmentation and quantification of uptake in organs requires labor-intensive organ delineations that are often not feasible in the clinic nor scalable for large clinical trials.

Purpose: In this work we develop and test the PSMA Healthy organ segmentation network (PSMA-Hornet), a fully-automated deep neural net for simultaneous segmentation of 14 healthy organs representing the normal biodistribution of [18F]DCFPyL on PET/CT images. We also propose a modified U-net architecture, a self-supervised pre-training method for PET/CT images, a multi-target Dice loss, and multi-target batch balancing to effectively train PSMA-Hornet and similar networks.

Methods: The study used manually-segmented [18F]DCFPyL PET/CT images from 100 subjects, and 526 similar images without segmentations. The unsegmented images were used for self-supervised model pretraining. For supervised training, Monte-Carlo cross-validation was used to evaluate the network performance, with 85 subjects in each trial reserved for model training, 5 for validation, and 10 for testing. Image segmentation and quantification metrics were evaluated on the test folds with respect to manual segmentations by a nuclear medicine physician, and compared to inter-rater agreement. The model's segmentation performance was also evaluated on a separate set of 19 images with high tumor load.

Results: With our best model, the lowest mean Dice coefficient on the test set was 0.826 for the sublingual gland, and the highest was 0.964 for liver. The highest mean error in tracer uptake quantification was 13.9% in the sublingual gland. Self-supervised pretraining improved training convergence, train-to-test generalization, and segmentation quality. In addition, we found that a multi-target network produced significantly higher segmentation accuracy than single-organ networks.

Conclusions: The developed network can be used to automatically obtain high-quality organ segmentations for PSMA image analysis tasks. It can be used to reproducibly extract imaging data, and holds promise for clinical applications such as personalized radiation dosimetry and improved radioligand therapy.

TITLE: Automated brain structures segmentation from PET/CT images based on landmark-constrained dual-modality atlas registration

AUTHORS: Zhaofeng Chen, Tianshuang Qiu, Yang Tian, Hongbo Feng, Yanjun Zhang, Hongkai Wang

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Automated brain structures segmentation in positron emission tomography (PET) images has been widely investigated to help brain disease diagnosis and follow-up. To relieve the burden of a manual definition of volume of interest (VOI), automated atlas-based VOI definition algorithms were developed, but these algorithms mostly adopted a global optimization strategy which may not be particularly accurate for local small structures (especially the deep brain structures). This paper presents a PET/CT-based brain VOI segmentation algorithm combining anatomical atlas, local landmarks, and dual-modality information. The method incorporates local deep brain landmarks detected by the Deep Q-Network (DQN) to constrain the atlas registration process. Dual-modality PET/CT image information is also combined to improve the registration accuracy of the extracerebral contour. We compare our algorithm with the representative brain atlas registration methods based on 86 clinical PET/CT images. The proposed algorithm obtained accurate delineation of brain VOIs with an average Dice similarity score of 0.79, an average surface distance of 0.97 mm (sub-pixel level), and a volume recovery coefficient close to 1. The main advantage of our method is that it optimizes both global-scale brain matching and local-scale small structure alignment around the key landmarks, it is fully automated and produces high-quality parcellation of the brain structures from brain PET/CT images.

TITLE: The impact of data-driven respiratory gating in clinical F-18 FDG PET/CT: comparison of free breathing and deep-expiration breath-hold CT protocol

AUTHORS: Seo Young Kang, Byung Seok Moon, Hye Ok Kim, Hai-Jeon Yoon, Bom Sahn Kim

JOURNAL: Annals of nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Background: Respiratory motion can diminish PET image quality and lead to inaccurate lesion quantifications. Data-driven gating (DDG) was recently introduced as an effective respiratory gating technique for PET. In the current study, we investigated the clinical impact of DDG on respiratory movement in18F-FDG PET/CT.

Method: PET list-mode data were collected for each subject and DDG software was utilized for extracting respiratory waveforms. PET images was reconstructed using Q.clear and Q.clear + DDG, respectively. We evaluated SUVmax, SUVmean, the coefficient of variance (CoV), metabolic tumor volume (MTV), and tumor heterogeneity using the area under the curve of cumulative SUV histogram (AUC-CSH). Metabolic parameter changes were compared between each reconstruction method. The Deep-Expiration Breath Hold (DEBH) protocol was introduced for CT scans to correct spatial misalignment between PET and CT and compared with conventional free breathing. The DEBH and free breathing (FB) protocol comparison was made in a separate matching cohort using propensity core matching rather than the same patient.

Results: Total 147 PET/CT scans with excessive respiratory movements were used to study DDG-mediated correction. After DDG application, SUVmax (P < 0.0001; 8.15 ± 4.77 vs. 9.03 ± 5.02) and SUVmean (P < 0.0001; 4.91 ± 2.44 vs. 5.49 ± 2.68) of lung and upper abdomen lesions increased, while MTV significantly decreased (P < 0.0001; 7.07 ± 15.46 vs. 6.58 ± 15.14). In addition, the percent change of SUVs was greater in lower lung lesions compared to upper lobe lesions. Likewise, the MTV reduction was significantly greater in lower lobe lesions. No significant difference dependent on location was observed in liver lesions. DEBH-mediated CT breathing correction did not make a significant difference in lesion metabolic parameters compared to conventional free breathing.

Conclusions: These results suggest that DDG correction enables more corrected quantification from respiratory movements for lesions located in the lung and upper abdomen. Therefore, we suggest that DDG is worth using as a standard protocol during18F-FDG PET/CT imaging.

TITLE: Automated lung tumor delineation on positron emission tomography/computed tomography via a hybrid regional network

AUTHORS: Yang Lei, Tonghe Wang, Jiwoong J Jeong, James Janopaul-Naylor, Aparna H Kesarwala, Justin Roper, Sibo Tian, Jeffrey D Bradley, Tian Liu, Kristin Higgins, Xiaofeng Yang

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Background: Multimodality positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging combines the anatomical information of CT with the functional information of PET. In the diagnosis and treatment of many cancers, such as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), PET/CT imaging allows more accurate delineation of tumor or involved lymph nodes for radiation planning.

Purpose: In this paper, we propose a hybrid regional network method of automatically segmenting lung tumors from PET/CT images.

Methods: The hybrid regional network architecture synthesizes the functional and anatomical information from the two image modalities, whereas the mask regional convolutional neural network (R-CNN) and scoring fine-tune the regional location and quality of the output segmentation. This model consists of five major subnetworks, that is, a dual feature representation network (DFRN), a regional proposal network (RPN), a specific tumor-wise R-CNN, a mask-Net, and a score head. Given a PET/CT image as inputs, the DFRN extracts feature maps from the PET and CT images. Then, the RPN and R-CNN work together to localize lung tumors and reduce the image size and feature map size by removing irrelevant regions. The mask-Net is used to segment tumor within a volume-of-interest (VOI) with a score head evaluating the segmentation performed by the mask-Net. Finally, the segmented tumor within the VOI was mapped back to the volumetric coordinate system based on the location information derived via the RPN and R-CNN. We trained, validated, and tested the proposed neural network using 100 PET/CT images of patients with NSCLC. A fivefold cross-validation study was performed. The segmentation was evaluated with two indicators: (1) multiple metrics, including the Dice similarity coefficient, Jacard, 95th percentile Hausdorff distance, mean surface distance (MSD), residual mean square distance, and center-of-mass distance; (2) Bland-Altman analysis and volumetric Pearson correlation analysis.

Results: In fivefold cross-validation, this method achieved Dice and MSD of 0.84 ± 0.15 and 1.38 ± 2.2 mm, respectively. A new PET/CT can be segmented in 1 s by this model. External validation on The Cancer Imaging Archive dataset (63 PET/CT images) indicates that the proposed model has superior performance compared to other methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method shows great promise to automatically delineate NSCLC tumors on PET/CT images, thereby allowing for a more streamlined clinical workflow that is faster and reduces physician effort.

TITLE: Deep learning-based binary classification of beta-amyloid plaques using 18 F florapronol PET

AUTHORS: Eui Jung An, Jin Beom Kim, Junik Son, Shin Young Jeong, Sang-Woo Lee, Byeong-Cheol Ahn, Pan-Woo Ko, Chae Moon Hong

JOURNAL: Nuclear medicine communications

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: This study aimed to investigate a deep learning model to classify amyloid plaque deposition in the brain PET images of patients suspected of Alzheimer's disease.

Methods: A retrospective study was conducted on patients who were suspected of having a mild cognitive impairment or dementia, and brain amyloid 18 F florapronol PET/computed tomography images were obtained from 2019 to 2022. Brain PET images were visually assessed by two nuclear medicine specialists, who classified them as either positive or negative. Image rotation was applied for data augmentation. The dataset was split into training and testing sets at a ratio of 8 : 2. For the convolutional neural network (CNN) analysis, stratified k-fold ( k = 5) cross-validation was applied using training set. Trained model was evaluated using testing set.

Results: A total of 175 patients were included in this study. The average age at the time of PET imaging was 70.4 ± 9.3 years and included 77 men and 98 women (44.0% and 56.0%, respectively). The visual assessment revealed positivity in 62 patients (35.4%) and negativity in 113 patients (64.6%). After stratified k-fold cross-validation, the CNN model showed an average accuracy of 0.917 ± 0.027. The model exhibited an accuracy of 0.914 and an area under the curve of 0.958 in the testing set. These findings affirm the model's high reliability in distinguishing between positive and negative cases.

Conclusion: The study verifies the potential of the CNN model to classify amyloid positive and negative cases using brain PET images. This model may serve as a supplementary tool to enhance the accuracy of clinical diagnoses.

TITLE: [Improvement of Cold Artifacts in Body Trunk 18F-FDG PET/CT by Absolute-single scatter simulation: Validation in an Out-of-body High-accumulation Phantom]

AUTHORS: Mizuki Kawarai, Toshiki Owaki, Kiyotaka Nakajima

JOURNAL: Nihon Hoshasen Gijutsu Gakkai zasshi

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: This study aimed to verify whether cold artifacts caused by the gap state between attenuation correction computed tomography (ACCT) and positron emission tomography (PET) data (so-called hot-in-air (HIA) state) in body trunk PET/computer tomography (CT) examinations can be improved by the Absolute-single scatter simulation (SSS), which is a scatter correction method in a phantom experiment using the high-accumulation syringe of out-of-body phantom.

Method: PET imaging profile curves in the HIA state were evaluated using a high-accumulation syringe that simulated a urinary tract pouch encapsulated with18F-FDG solution. The hot syringe-to-background ratio (HBR) of the syringe was changed to 5, 7, and 10. Moreover, PET image quality evaluation of the HIA state was performed with a syringe placed on the top of a NEMA IEC body phantom. Six spheres (10-37 mm in diameter) were placed inside the phantom and filled with18F-FDG solution with a sphere-to-background ratio of 4. The evaluation items of image quality were N10 mm, QH, 10 mm/ N10 mm, and recovery coefficient (RC).

Result: The image quality tended to deteriorate as the HBR of the syringe increased in the relative-SSS, while the effect was small in the Absolute-SSS and the lowest at HBR 10. The RC10 mmof HBR 5 was 0.33 for the Relative-SSS, which was below the criterion for the Relative-SSS, but was 0.5 for the Absolute-SSS, which met the criterion.

Conclusion: Absolute-SSS significantly improved cold artifacts caused by HIA states on body trunk PET/CT examinations, suggesting that it is highly useful both visually and quantitatively.

TITLE: Improving the fidelity of CT image colorization based on pseudo-intensity model and tumor metabolism enhancement

AUTHORS: Zexu Zhang, Huiyan Jiang, Jiaji Liu, Tianyu Shi

JOURNAL: Computers in biology and medicine

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Background: Subject to the principle of imaging, most medical images are gray-scale images. Human eyes are more sensitive to color images compared to gray-scale images. The state-of-the-art medical image colorization results are unnatural and unrealistic, especially in some organs, such as the lung field.

Method: We propose a CT image colorization network that consists of a pseudo-intensity model, tumor metabolic enhancement, and MemoPainter-cGAN colorization network. First, the distributions of both the density of CT images and the intensity of anatomical images are analyzed with the aim of building a pseudo-intensity model. Then, the PET images, which are sensitive to tumor metabolism, are used to highlight the tumor regions. Finally, the MemoPainter-cGAN is used to generate colorized anatomical images.

Results: Our experiment verified that the mean structural similarity between the colorized images and the original color images is 0.995, which indicates that the colorized image maintains the features of the original images enormously. The average image information entropy is 6.62, which is 13.4% higher than that of the images before metabolism enhancement and colorization. It indicates that the image fidelity is significantly improved.

Conclusions: Our method can generate vivid and fresh anatomical images based on prior knowledge of tissue or organ intensity. The colorized PET/CT images with abundant anatomical knowledge and high sensitivity of metabolic information provide radiologists with access to a new modality that offers additional reference information.

TITLE: Phantom study of an in-house amplitude-gating respiratory method with silicon photomultiplier technology positron emission tomography/computed tomography

AUTHORS: Pascal Bailly, Roger Bouzerar, Romain Galan, Marc-Etienne Meyer

JOURNAL: Computer methods and programs in biomedicine

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: The objective of this phantom study was to determine whether breathing-synchronized, silicon photomultiplier (SiPM)-based PET/CT has a suitable acquisition time for routine clinical use.

Methods: Acquisitions were performed in list mode on a 4-ring SiPM-based PET/CT system. The experimental setup consisted of an external respiratory tracking device placed on a commercial dynamic thorax phantom containing a sphere filled with [F-18]-fluorodeoxyglucose. Three-dimensional sinusoidal motion was imposed on the sphere. Data were processed using frequency binning and amplitude binning (the "DMI" and "OFFLINE" methods, respectively). PET sinograms were reconstructed with a Bayesian penalized likelihood algorithm.

Results: Respiratory gating from a 150‑sec acquisition was successful. The DMI and OFFLINE methods gave similar activity profiles but both were slightly shifted in space; the latter profile was closest to the reference acquisition.

Conclusion: With SiPM PET/CT systems, the amplitude-based processing of breathing-synchronized data is likely to be feasible in routine clinical practice.

ABSTRACT:
Objective.Target volumes for radiotherapy are usually contoured manually, which can be time-consuming and prone to inter- and intra-observer variability. Automatic contouring by convolutional neural networks (CNN) can be fast and consistent but may produce unrealistic contours or miss relevant structures. We evaluate approaches for increasing the quality and assessing the uncertainty of CNN-generated contours of head and neck cancers with PET/CT as input.Approach.Two patient cohorts with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and baseline18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography and computed tomography images (FDG-PET/CT) were collected retrospectively from two centers. The union of manual contours of the gross primary tumor and involved nodes was used to train CNN models for generating automatic contours. The impact of image preprocessing, image augmentation, transfer learning and CNN complexity, architecture, and dimension (2D or 3D) on model performance and generalizability across centers was evaluated. A Monte Carlo dropout technique was used to quantify and visualize the uncertainty of the automatic contours.Main results. CNN models provided contours with good overlap with the manually contoured ground truth (median Dice Similarity Coefficient: 0.75-0.77), consistent with reported inter-observer variations and previous auto-contouring studies. Image augmentation and model dimension, rather than model complexity, architecture, or advanced image preprocessing, had the largest impact on model performance and cross-center generalizability. Transfer learning on a limited number of patients from a separate center increased model generalizability without decreasing model performance on the original training cohort. High model uncertainty was associated with false positive and false negative voxels as well as low Dice coefficients.Significance.High quality automatic contours can be obtained using deep learning architectures that are not overly complex. Uncertainty estimation of the predicted contours shows potential for highlighting regions of the contour requiring manual revision or flagging segmentations requiring manual inspection and intervention.

AUTHORS: Zhongliang Xue, Ping Li, Liang Zhang, Xiaoyuan Lu, Guangming Zhu, Peiyi Shen, Syed Afaq Ali Shah, Mohammed Bennamoun

JOURNAL: IEEE transactions on medical imaging

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Liver lesion segmentation is an essential process to assist doctors in hepatocellular carcinoma diagnosis and treatment planning. Multi-modal positron emission tomography and computed tomography (PET-CT) scans are widely utilized due to their complementary feature information for this purpose. However, current methods ignore the interaction of information across the two modalities during feature extraction, omit the co-learning of the feature maps of different resolutions, and do not ensure that shallow and deep features complement each others sufficiently. In this paper, our proposed model can achieve feature interaction across multi-modal channels by sharing the down-sampling blocks between two encoding branches to eliminate misleading features. Furthermore, we combine feature maps of different resolutions to derive spatially varying fusion maps and enhance the lesions information. In addition, we introduce a similarity loss function for consistency constraint in case that predictions of separated refactoring branches for the same regions vary a lot. We evaluate our model for liver tumor segmentation using a PET-CT scans dataset, compare our method with the baseline techniques for multi-modal (multi-branches, multi-channels and cascaded networks) and then demonstrate that our method has a significantly higher accuracy ( ) than the baseline models.

TITLE: Advances in Neuroimaging and Multiple Post-Processing Techniques for Epileptogenic Zone Detection of Drug-Resistant Epilepsy

AUTHORS: Lei Yao, Nan Cheng, An-Qiang Chen, Xun Wang, Ming Gao, Qing-Xia Kong, Yu Kong

JOURNAL: Journal of magnetic resonance imaging : JMRI

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Among the approximately 20 million patients with drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) worldwide, the vast majority can benefit from surgery to minimize seizure reduction and neurological impairment. Precise preoperative localization of epileptogenic zone (EZ) and complete resection of the lesions can influence the postoperative prognosis. However, precise localization of EZ is difficult, and the structural and functional alterations in the brain caused by DRE vary by etiology. Neuroimaging has emerged as an approach to identify the seizure-inducing structural and functional changes in the brain, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) have become routine noninvasive imaging tools for preoperative evaluation of DRE in many epilepsy treatment centers. Multimodal neuroimaging offers unique advantages in detecting EZ, especially in improving the detection rate of patients with negative MRI or PET findings. This approach can characterize the brain imaging characteristics of patients with DRE caused by different etiologies, serving as a bridge between clinical and pathological findings and providing a basis for individualized clinical treatment plans. In addition to the integration of multimodal imaging modalities and the development of special scanning sequences and image post-processing techniques for early and precise localization of EZ, the application of deep machine learning for extracting image features and deep learning-based artificial intelligence have gradually improved diagnostic efficiency and accuracy. These improvements can provide clinical assistance for precisely outlining the scope of EZ and indicating the relationship between EZ and functional brain areas, thereby enabling standardized and precise surgery and ensuring good prognosis. However, most existing studies have limitations imposed by factors such as their small sample sizes or hypothesis-based study designs. Therefore, we believe that the application of neuroimaging and post-processing techniques in DRE requires further development and that more efficient and accurate imaging techniques are urgently needed in clinical practice. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 5 TECHNICAL EFFICACY: Stage 2.

JOURNAL: Molecular imaging and biology

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Preclinical imaging, with translational potential, lacks a standardized method for defining volumes of interest (VOIs), impacting data reproducibility. The aim of this study was to determine the interobserver variability of VOI sizes and standard uptake values (SUVmeanand SUVmax) of different organs using the same [18F]FDG-PET and PET/CT datasets analyzed by multiple observers. In addition, the effect of a standardized analysis approach was evaluated.

Procedures: In total, 12 observers (4 beginners and 8 experts) analyzed identical preclinical [18F]FDG-PET-only and PET/CT datasets according to their local default image analysis protocols for multiple organs. Furthermore, a standardized protocol was defined, including detailed information on the respective VOI size and position for multiple organs, and all observers reanalyzed the PET/CT datasets following this protocol.

Results: Without standardization, significant differences in the SUVmeanand SUVmaxwere found among the observers. Coregistering CT images with PET images improved the comparability to a limited extent. The introduction of a standardized protocol that details the VOI size and position for multiple organs reduced interobserver variability and enhanced comparability.

Conclusions: The protocol offered clear guidelines and was particularly beneficial for beginners, resulting in improved comparability of SUVmeanand SUVmaxvalues for various organs. The study suggested that incorporating an additional VOI template could further enhance the comparability of the findings in preclinical imaging analyses.

TITLE: Eliminating the second CT scan of dual-tracer total-body PET/CT via deep learning-based image synthesis and registration

AUTHORS: Yu Lin, Kang Wang, Zhe Zheng, Haojun Yu, Shuguang Chen, WenXin Tang, Yibo He, Huaping Gao, Runjun Yang, Yunzhe Xie, Junjie Yang, Xiaoguang Hou, Shuo Wang, Hongcheng Shi

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: This study aims to develop and validate a deep learning framework designed to eliminate the second CT scan of dual-tracer total-body PET/CT imaging.

Methods: We retrospectively included three cohorts of 247 patients who underwent dual-tracer total-body PET/CT imaging on two separate days (time interval:1-11 days). Out of these, 167 underwent [68Ga]Ga-DOTATATE/[18F]FDG, 50 underwent [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11/[18F]FDG, and 30 underwent [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04/[18F]FDG. A deep learning framework was developed that integrates a registration generative adversarial network (RegGAN) with non-rigid registration techniques. This approach allows for the transformation of attenuation-correction CT (ACCT) images from the first scan into pseudo-ACCT images for the second scan, which are then used for attenuation and scatter correction (ASC) of the second tracer PET images. Additionally, the derived registration transform facilitates dual-tracer image fusion and analysis. The deep learning-based ASC PET images were evaluated using quantitative metrics, including mean absolute error (MAE), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), and structural similarity index measure (SSIM) across the whole body and specific regions. Furthermore, the quantitative accuracy of PET images was assessed by calculating standardized uptake value (SUV) bias in normal organs and lesions.

Results: The MAE for whole-body pseudo-ACCT images ranged from 97.64 to 112.59 HU across four tracers. The deep learning-based ASC PET images demonstrated high similarity to the ground-truth PET images. The MAE of SUV for whole-body PET images was 0.06 for [68Ga]Ga-DOTATATE, 0.08 for [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11, 0.06 for [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04, and 0.05 for [18F]FDG, respectively. Additionally, the median absolute percent deviation of SUV was less than 2.6% for all normal organs, while the mean absolute percent deviation of SUV was less than 3.6% for lesions across four tracers.

Conclusion: The proposed deep learning framework, combining RegGAN and non-rigid registration, shows promise in reducing CT radiation dose for dual-tracer total-body PET/CT imaging, with successful validation across multiple tracers.

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear cardiology : official publication of the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Background: We aim to assess the spill-in effect and the benefit in quantitative accuracy for [18F]-NaF PET/CT imaging of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) using the background correction (BC) technique.

Methods: Seventy-two datasets of patients diagnosed with AAA were reconstructed with ordered subset expectation maximization algorithm incorporating point spread function (PSF). Spill-in effect was investigated for the entire aneurysm (AAA), and part of the aneurysm excluding the region close to the bone (AAAexc). Quantifications of PSF and PSF+BC images using different thresholds (% of max. SUV in target regions-of-interest) to derive target-to-background (TBR) values (TBRmax, TBR90, TBR70and TBR50) were compared at 3 and 10 iterations.

Results: TBR differences were observed between AAA and AAAexcdue to spill-in effect from the bone into the aneurysm. TBRmaxshowed the highest sensitivity to the spill-in effect while TBR50showed the least. The spill-in effect was reduced at 10 iterations compared to 3 iterations, but at the expense of reduced contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR). TBR50yielded the best trade-off between increased CNR and reduced spill-in effect. PSF+BC method reduced TBR sensitivity to spill-in effect, especially at 3 iterations, compared to PSF (P-value ≤ 0.05).

Conclusion: TBR50is robust metric for reduced spill-in and increased CNR.

TITLE: Automatic Inter-Frame Patient Motion Correction for Dynamic Cardiac PET Using Deep Learning

AUTHORS: Luyao Shi, Yihuan Lu, Nicha Dvornek, Christopher A Weyman, Edward J Miller, Albert J Sinusas, Chi Liu

JOURNAL: IEEE transactions on medical imaging

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Patient motion during dynamic PET imaging can induce errors in myocardial blood flow (MBF) estimation. Motion correction for dynamic cardiac PET is challenging because the rapid tracer kinetics of 82Rb leads to substantial tracer distribution change across different dynamic frames over time, which can cause difficulties for image registration-based motion correction, particularly for early dynamic frames. In this paper, we developed an automatic deep learning-based motion correction (DeepMC) method for dynamic cardiac PET. In this study we focused on the detection and correction of inter-frame rigid translational motion caused by voluntary body movement and pattern change of respiratory motion. A bidirectional-3D LSTM network was developed to fully utilize both local and nonlocal temporal information in the 4D dynamic image data for motion detection. The network was trained and evaluated over motion-free patient scans with simulated motion so that the motion ground-truths are available, where one million samples based on 65 patient scans were used in training, and 600 samples based on 20 patient scans were used in evaluation. The proposed method was also evaluated using additional 10 patient datasets with real motion. We demonstrated that the proposed DeepMC obtained superior performance compared to conventional registration-based methods and other convolutional neural networks (CNN), in terms of motion estimation and MBF quantification accuracy. Once trained, DeepMC is much faster than the registration-based methods and can be easily integrated into the clinical workflow. In the future work, additional investigation is needed to evaluate this approach in a clinical context with realistic patient motion.

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Accurate delineation of the intraprostatic gross tumor volume (GTV) is a prerequisite for treatment approaches in patients with primary prostate cancer (PCa). Prostate-specific membrane antigen PET (PSMA PET) may outperform MRI in GTV detection. However, visual GTV delineation underlies interobserver heterogeneity and is time consuming. The aim of this study was to develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) for automated segmentation of intraprostatic tumor (GTV-CNN) in PSMA PET.Methods:The CNN (3D U-Net) was trained on the68Ga-PSMA PET images of 152 patients from 2 different institutions, and the training labels were generated manually using a validated technique. The CNN was tested on 2 independent internal (cohort 1:68Ga-PSMA PET,n= 18 and cohort 2:18F-PSMA PET,n= 19) and 1 external (cohort 3:68Ga-PSMA PET,n= 20) test datasets. Accordance between manual contours and GTV-CNN was assessed with the Dice-Sørensen coefficient (DSC). Sensitivity and specificity were calculated for the 2 internal test datasets (cohort 1:n= 18, cohort 2:n= 11) using whole-mount histology.Results:The median DSCs for cohorts 1-3 were 0.84 (range: 0.32-0.95), 0.81 (range: 0.28-0.93), and 0.83 (range: 0.32-0.93), respectively. Sensitivities and specificities for the GTV-CNN were comparable with manual expert contours: 0.98 and 0.76 (cohort 1) and 1 and 0.57 (cohort 2), respectively. Computation time was around 6 s for a standard dataset.Conclusion:The application of a CNN for automated contouring of intraprostatic GTV in68Ga-PSMA and18F-PSMA PET images resulted in a high concordance with expert contours and in high sensitivities and specificities in comparison with histology as a reference. This robust, accurate and fast technique may be implemented for treatment concepts in primary prostate cancer. The trained model and the study's source code are available in an open source repository.

TITLE: GeSeNet: A General Semantic-Guided Network With Couple Mask Ensemble for Medical Image Fusion

AUTHORS: Jiawei Li, Jinyuan Liu, Shihua Zhou, Qiang Zhang, Nikola K Kasabov

JOURNAL: IEEE transactions on neural networks and learning systems

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
At present, multimodal medical image fusion technology has become an essential means for researchers and doctors to predict diseases and study pathology. Nevertheless, how to reserve more unique features from different modal source images on the premise of ensuring time efficiency is a tricky problem. To handle this issue, we propose a flexible semantic-guided architecture with a mask-optimized framework in an end-to-end manner, termed as GeSeNet. Specifically, a region mask module is devised to deepen the learning of important information while pruning redundant computation for reducing the runtime. An edge enhancement module and a global refinement module are presented to modify the extracted features for boosting the edge textures and adjusting overall visual performance. In addition, we introduce a semantic module that is cascaded with the proposed fusion network to deliver semantic information into our generated results. Sufficient qualitative and quantitative comparative experiments (i.e., MRI-CT, MRI-PET, and MRI-SPECT) are deployed between our proposed method and ten state-of-the-art methods, which shows our generated images lead the way. Moreover, we also conduct operational efficiency comparisons and ablation experiments to prove that our proposed method can perform excellently in the field of multimodal medical image fusion. The code is available at https://github.com/lok-18/GeSeNet.

JOURNAL: Physical and engineering sciences in medicine

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Segmentation of organs and lesions could be employed for the express purpose of dosimetry in nuclear medicine, assisted image interpretations, and mass image processing studies. Deep leaning created liver and liver lesion segmentation on clinical 3D MRI data has not been fully addressed in previous experiments. To this end, the required data were collected from 128 patients, including their T1w and T2w MRI images, and ground truth labels of the liver and liver lesions were generated. The collection of 110 T1w-T2w MRI image sets was divided, with 94 designated for training and 16 for validation. Furthermore, 18 more datasets were separately allocated for use as hold-out test datasets. The T1w and T2w MRI images were preprocessed into a two-channel format so that they were used as inputs to the deep learning model based on the Isensee 2017 network. To calculate the final Dice coefficient of the network performance on test datasets, the binary average of T1w and T2w predicted images was used. The deep learning model could segment all 18 test cases, with an average Dice coefficient of 88% for the liver and 53% for the liver tumor. Liver segmentation was carried out with rather a high accuracy; this could be achieved for liver dosimetry during systemic or selective radiation therapies as well as for attenuation correction in PET/MRI scanners. Nevertheless, the delineation of liver lesions was not optimal; therefore, tumor detection was not practical by the proposed method on clinical data.

JOURNAL: Clinical nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Rationale: We evaluated K-means clustering to classify amyloid brain PETs as positive or negative.

Patients and methods: Sixty-six participants (31 men, 35 women; age range, 52-81 years) were recruited through a multicenter observational study: 19 cognitively normal, 25 mild cognitive impairment, and 22 dementia (11 Alzheimer disease, 3 subcortical vascular cognitive impairment, and 8 Parkinson-Lewy Body spectrum disorder). As part of the neurocognitive and imaging evaluation, each participant had an 18F-flutemetamol (Vizamyl, GE Healthcare) brain PET. All studies were processed using Cortex ID software (General Electric Company, Boston, MA) to calculate SUV ratios in 19 regions of interest and clinically interpreted by 2 dual-certified radiologists/nuclear medicine physicians, using MIM software (MIM Software Inc, Cleveland, OH), blinded to the quantitative analysis, with final interpretation based on consensus. K-means clustering was retrospectively used to classify the studies from the quantitative data.

Results: Based on clinical interpretation, 46 brain PETs were negative and 20 were positive for amyloid deposition. Of 19 cognitively normal participants, 1 (5%) had a positive 18F-flutemetamol brain PET. Of 25 participants with mild cognitive impairment, 9 (36%) had a positive 18F-flutemetamol brain PET. Of 22 participants with dementia, 10 (45%) had a positive 18F-flutemetamol brain PET; 7 of 11 participants with Alzheimer disease (64%), 1 of 3 participants with vascular cognitive impairment (33%), and 2 of 8 participants with Parkinson-Lewy Body spectrum disorder (25%) had a positive 18F-flutemetamol brain PET. Using clinical interpretation as the criterion standard, K-means clustering (K = 2) gave sensitivity of 95%, specificity of 98%, and accuracy of 97%.

Conclusions: K-means clustering may be a powerful algorithm for classifying amyloid brain PET.

TITLE: Deep learning-based segmentation of ultra-low-dose CT images using an optimized nnU-Net model

JOURNAL: La Radiologia medica

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Low-dose CT protocols are widely used for emergency imaging, follow-ups, and attenuation correction in hybrid PET/CT and SPECT/CT imaging. However, low-dose CT images often suffer from reduced quality depending on acquisition and patient attenuation parameters. Deep learning (DL)-based organ segmentation models are typically trained on high-quality images, with limited dedicated models for noisy CT images. This study aimed to develop a DL pipeline for organ segmentation on ultra-low-dose CT images.

Materials and methods: 274 CT raw datasets were reconstructed using Siemens ReconCT software with ADMIRE iterative algorithm, generating full-dose (FD-CT) and simulated low-dose (LD-CT) images at 1%, 2%, 5%, and 10% of the original tube current. Existing FD-nnU-Net models segmented 22 organs on FD-CT images, serving as reference masks for training new LD-nnU-Net models using LD-CT images. Three models were trained for bony tissue (6 organs), soft-tissue (15 organs), and body contour segmentation. The segmented masks from LD-CT were compared to FD-CT as standard of reference. External datasets with actual LD-CT images were also segmented and compared.

Results: FD-nnU-Net performance declined with reduced radiation dose, especially below 10% (5 mAs). LD-nnU-Net achieved average Dice scores of 0.937 ± 0.049 (bony tissues), 0.905 ± 0.117 (soft-tissues), and 0.984 ± 0.023 (body contour). LD models outperformed FD models on external datasets.

Conclusion: Conventional FD-nnU-Net models performed poorly on LD-CT images. Dedicated LD-nnU-Net models demonstrated superior performance across cross-validation and external evaluations, enabling accurate segmentation of ultra-low-dose CT images. The trained models are available on our GitHub page.

TITLE: Organomics: A Concept Reflecting the Importance of PET/CT Healthy Organ Radiomics in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Prognosis Prediction Using Machine Learning

AUTHORS: Yazdan Salimi, Ghasem Hajianfar, Zahra Mansouri, Amirhosein Sanaat, Mehdi Amini, Isaac Shiri, Habib Zaidi

JOURNAL: Clinical nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Non-small cell lung cancer is the most common subtype of lung cancer. Patient survival prediction using machine learning (ML) and radiomics analysis proved to provide promising outcomes. However, most studies reported in the literature focused on information extracted from malignant lesions. This study aims to explore the relevance and additional value of information extracted from healthy organs in addition to tumoral tissue using ML algorithms.

Patients and methods: This study included PET/CT images of 154 patients collected from available online databases. The gross tumor volume and 33 volumes of interest defined on healthy organs were segmented using nnU-Net deep learning-based segmentation. Subsequently, 107 radiomic features were extracted from PET and CT images (Organomics). Clinical information was combined with PET and CT radiomics from organs and gross tumor volumes considering 19 different combinations of inputs. Finally, different feature selection (FS; 5 methods) and ML (6 algorithms) algorithms were tested in a 3-fold data split cross-validation scheme. The performance of the models was quantified in terms of the concordance index (C-index) metric.

Results: For an input combination of all radiomics information, most of the selected features belonged to PET Organomics and CT Organomics. The highest C-index (0.68) was achieved using univariate C-index FS method and random survival forest ML model using CT Organomics + PET Organomics as input as well as minimum depth FS method and CoxPH ML model using PET Organomics as input. Considering all 17 combinations with C-index higher than 0.65, Organomics from PET or CT images were used as input in 16 of them.

Conclusions: The selected features and C-indices demonstrated that the additional information extracted from healthy organs of both PET and CT imaging modalities improved the ML performance. Organomics could be a step toward exploiting the whole information available from multimodality medical images, contributing to the emerging field of digital twins in health care.

JOURNAL: Clinical nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
A 51-year-old man with severe multifactorial neurocognitive disorders subsequent to delirium, benzodiazepine withdrawal, and preexisting psychiatric illness was referred for 18 F-FDG PET/CT brain imaging in order to rule out an underlying neurodegenerative cause of the symptoms, particularly frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Imaging was impaired by severe motion artifacts, leading to a false-positive result. However, utilizing retrospective data-driven motion correction facilitated a change in diagnosis, ruling out the presence of neurodegenerative disease. The implementation of motion correction of the 18 F-FDG PET dataset proved crucial for the patient, as the exclusion of frontotemporal lobar degeneration formed the basis for continuing psychiatric and psychotherapeutic treatment.

TITLE: Patch-Wise Deep Learning Method for Intracranial Stenosis and Aneurysm Detection-the Tromsø Study

AUTHORS: Luca Bernecker, Ellisiv B Mathiesen, Tor Ingebrigtsen, Jørgen Isaksen, Liv-Hege Johnsen, Torgil Riise Vangberg

JOURNAL: Neuroinformatics

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis (ICAS) and intracranial aneurysms are prevalent conditions in the cerebrovascular system. ICAS causes a narrowing of the arterial lumen, thereby restricting blood flow, while aneurysms involve the ballooning of blood vessels. Both conditions can lead to severe outcomes, such as stroke or vessel rupture, which can be fatal. Early detection is crucial for effective intervention. In this study, we introduced a method that combines classical computer vision techniques with deep learning to detect intracranial aneurysms and ICAS in time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography images. The process began with skull-stripping, followed by an affine transformation to align the images to a common atlas space. We then focused on the region of interest, including the circle of Willis, by cropping the relevant area. A segmentation algorithm was used to isolate the arteries, after which a patch-wise residual neural network was applied across the image. A voting mechanism was then employed to identify the presence of atrophies. Our method achieved accuracies of 76.5% for aneurysms and 82.4% for ICAS. Notably, when occlusions were not considered, the accuracy for ICAS detection improved to 85.7%. While the algorithm performed well for localized pathological findings, it was less effective at detecting occlusions, which involved long-range dependencies in the MRIs. This limitation was due to the architectural design of the patch-wise deep learning approach. Regardless, this can, in the future, be mitigated in a multi-scale patch-wise algorithm.

TITLE: PET/CT Myocardial Perfusion Imaging Acquisition and Processing: Ten Tips and Tricks to Help You Succeed

AUTHORS: Talal Alnabelsi, Akanksha Thakkar, Ahmed Ibrahim Ahmed, Yushui Han, Mouaz H Al-Mallah

JOURNAL: Current cardiology reports

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Purpose of review: Positron emission tomography (PET) is a leading non-invasive modality for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease due to its diagnostic accuracy and high image quality. With the latest advances in PET systems, clinicians are able to assess for myocardial ischemia and myocardial blood flow while exposing patients to extremely low radiation doses. This review will focus on the basics of acquisition and processing of hybrid PET/CT systems from appropriate patient selection to common artifacts and pitfalls.

Recent findings: The continued development of hybrid PET/CT technology is producing scanners with exquisite sensitivity capable of generating high-quality images while exposing patients to low radiation doses. List mode acquisition is an essential component in all modern PET/CT scanners allowing simultaneous dynamic and ECG-gated imaging without lengthening scan duration. Various PET radiotracers are currently being developed but rubidium-82 and 13N-ammonia remain the most commonly used perfusion radiotracers. The development of mini 13N-ammonia cyclotrons is a promising tool that should increase access to this radiotracer. Misregistration, attenuation from extra-cardiac activity, and patient motion are the most common causes of artifacts during perfusion imaging. Techniques to automatically realign images and correct respiratory or patient motion artifacts continue to evolve. Despite the continuous evolution of PET imaging techniques, basic knowledge of scan parameters, acquisition techniques, and post processing tools remains essential to ensure high-quality images are produced and artifacts are recognized and corrected. Future research should focus on optimizing scanners to allow for shorter scan protocols and lower radiation exposure as well as continue developing techniques to minimize and correct for motion and misregistration artifacts.

TITLE: Effects of data-driven respiratory gating on visualization and quantification of breast and upper abdominal cancers in FDG PET/CT examinations

AUTHORS: Mitsuaki Tatsumi, Naomi Morita, Akira Kida, Risa Momoi, Kayako Isohashi, Atsuya Okada, Noriyuki Tomiyama

JOURNAL: Annals of nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Objective: Data-driven respiratory gating (DDG) has recently been introduced to improve image quality in the PET portion of PET/CT examinations. The latest DDG system does not require any external equipment or extended examination time. In this study, we investigated the effects of the new DDG system on the visualization and quantification of breast and upper abdominal cancers, comparing the results with those obtained using the standard free-breathing (STD) PET protocol.

Methods: A total of 223 cancer lesions (138 breast and 85 upper abdominal) evaluated with FDG PET/CT were included in this study. PET images were reconstructed using the STD and DDG algorithms. Lesion blurring and conspicuity were each visually graded on a three-point scale. The longest diameter (LD), SUVmax, and metabolic tumor volume (MTV) of the lesions were used for quantitative analysis. % change in SUVmax or MTV was calculated from the metrics in STD and DDG images. Fifty-six texture features (TFs) were also evaluated. Visual scores and quantitative metrics were compared between STD and DDG images. % change in SUVmax or MTV was compared in the lesion location groups or in the high and low groups based on LD, SUVmax, or MTV in STD images.

Results: Visual scores for lesion blurring and conspicuity were both significantly higher in DDG than in STD PET images. SUVmax and MTV were significantly higher and lower, respectively, in DDG than in STD images. An increase in SUVmax and a decrease in MTV were observed in 96% and 86% of all lesions, respectively. Group analysis revealed that % change in SUVmax was greater in the upper abdominal than the breast lesions and % change in MTV was greater in the high LD and high MTV groups than in the low LD and low MTV groups, respectively. Quantitative changes in TFs were observed between STD and DDG images for most of the features.

Conclusion: This study demonstrated that DDG improved visualization and quantification of breast and upper abdominal cancers in FDG PET/CT examinations. DDG PET images exhibited an increase in SUVmax, a decrease in MTV, and changes in TFs.

TITLE: Comparison of deep learning synthesis of synthetic CTs using clinical MRI inputs

AUTHORS: Haley A Massa, Jacob M Johnson, Alan B McMillan

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
There has been substantial interest in developing techniques for synthesizing CT-like images from MRI inputs, with important applications in simultaneous PET/MR and radiotherapy planning. Deep learning has recently shown great potential for solving this problem. The goal of this research was to investigate the capability of four common clinical MRI sequences (T1-weighted gradient-echo [T1], T2-weighted fat-suppressed fast spin-echo [T2-FatSat], post-contrast T1-weighted gradient-echo [T1-Post], and fast spin-echo T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery [CUBE-FLAIR]) as inputs into a deep CT synthesis pipeline. Data were obtained retrospectively in 92 subjects who had undergone an MRI and CT scan on the same day. The patient's MR and CT scans were registered to one another using affine registration. The deep learning model was a convolutional neural network encoder-decoder with skip connections similar to the U-net architecture and Inception V3 inspired blocks instead of sequential convolution blocks. After training with 150 epochs and a batch size of 6, the model was evaluated using structural similarity index (SSIM), peak SNR (PSNR), mean absolute error (MAE), and dice coefficient. We found that feasible results were attainable for each image type, and no single image type was superior for all analyses. The MAE (in HU) of the resulting synthesized CT in the whole brain was 51.236 ± 4.504 for CUBE-FLAIR, 45.432 ± 8.517 for T1, 44.558 ± 7.478 for T1-Post, and 45.721 ± 8.7767 for T2, showing not only feasible, but also very compelling results on clinical images. Deep learning-based synthesis of CT images from MRI is possible with a wide range of inputs, suggesting that viable images can be created from a wide range of clinical input types.

TITLE: Bridging the gap between structural and metabolic neuroimaging via MRI-to-PET synthesis: A tri-attention enhanced GAN approach

AUTHORS: Jinhua Sheng, Haodi Zhu, Rougang Zhou, Qiao Zhang, Jialei Wang, Ziyi Ying

JOURNAL: Brain research

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) are two essential neuroimaging modalities that provide complementary structural and metabolic information about the brain, thereby enhancing diagnostic precision for brain disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). To address the limitations of missing modality data, we propose a novel 3D GAN-based framework for MRI-to-PET neuroimage synthesis, incorporating a Tri-Attention module to integrate spatial, channel, and frequency attention across multiple scales. The proposed method enables the generation of complementary metabolism information by synthesizing PET scans, effectively bridging the modality gap. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated on a subset of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our approach, achieving significant improvements in image quality metrics (SSIM: 0.882, PSNR: 26.508) and clinical metrics (SUVR), outperforming state-of-the-art methods. These findings underscore the potential of our framework to bridge the gap between structural and metabolic information, offering a promising tool for cross-modality neuroimage synthesis and clinical applications.

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Develop a universal lesion recognition algorithm for PET/CT and PET/MRI, validate it, and explore factors affecting performance.

Procedures: The 2022 AutoPet Challenge's 1014 PET/CT dataset was used to train the lesion detection model based on 2D and 3D fractional-residual (F-Res) models. To extend this to PET/MRI, a network for converting MR images to synthetic CT (sCT) was developed, using 41 sets of whole-body MR and corresponding CT data. 38 patients' PET/CT and PET/MRI data were used to verify the universal lesion recognition algorithm. Image quality was assessed using signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR). Total lesion glycolysis (TLG), metabolic tumor volume (MTV), and lesion count were calculated from the resultant lesion masks. Experienced physicians reviewed and corrected the model's outputs, establishing the ground truth. The performance of the lesion detection deep-learning model on different PET images was assessed by detection accuracy, precision, recall, and dice coefficients. Data with a detection accuracy score (DAS) less than 1 was used for analysis of outliers.

Results: Compared to PET/CT, PET/MRI scans had a significantly longer delay time (135 ± 45 min vs 61 ± 12 min) and lower SNR (6.17 ± 1.11 vs 9.27 ± 2.77). However, CNR values were similar (7.37 ± 5.40 vs 5.86 ± 6.69). PET/MRI detected more lesions (with a mean difference of -3.184). TLG and MTV showed no significant differences between PET/CT and PET/MRI (TLG: 119.18 ± 203.15 vs 123.57 ± 151.58, p = 0.41; MTV: 36.58 ± 57.00 vs 39.16 ± 48.34, p = 0.33). A total of 12 PET/CT and 14 PET/MRI datasets were included in the analysis of outliers. Outlier analysis revealed PET/CT anomalies in intestines, ureters, and muscles, while PET/MRI anomalies were in intestines, testicles, and low tracer uptake regions, with false positives in ureters (PET/CT) and intestines/testicles (PET/MRI).

Conclusion: The deep learning lesion detection model performs well with both PET/CT and PET/MRI. SNR, CNR and reconstruction parameters minimally impact recognition accuracy, but delay time post-injection is significant.

TITLE: Role of textural and radiomic analysis parameters in predicting histopathological parameters of the tumor in breast cancer patients

AUTHORS: Rutuja Kote, Mudalsha Ravina, Harish Goyal, Debajyoti Mohanty, Rakesh Gupta, Arvind Kumar Shukla, Moulish Reddy, Pratheek N Prasanth

JOURNAL: Nuclear medicine communications

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Introduction: Texture and radiomic analysis characterizes the tumor's phenotype and evaluates its microenvironment in quantitative terms. This study aims to investigate the role of textural and radiomic analysis parameters in predicting histopathological factors in breast cancer patients.

Materials and methods: Two hundred and twelve primary breast cancer patients underwent 18 F-FDG PET/computed tomography for staging. The images were processed in a commercially available textural analysis software. ROI was drawn over the primary tumor with a 40% threshold and was processed further to derive textural and radiomic parameters. These parameters were then compared with histopathological factors of tumor. Receiver-operating characteristic analysis was performed with a P -value <0.05 for statistical significance. The significant parameters were subsequently utilized in various machine learning models to assess their predictive accuracy.

Results: A retrospective study of 212 primary breast cancer patients was done. Among all the significant parameters, SUVmin, SUVmean, SUVstd, SUVmax, discretized HISTO_Entropy, and gray level co-occurrence matrix_Contrast were found to be significantly associated with ductal carcinoma type. Four parameters (SUVmin, SUVmean, SUVstd, and SUVmax) were significant in differentiating the luminal subtypes of the tumor. Five parameters (SUVmin, SUVmean, SUVstd, SUVmax, and SUV kurtosis) were significant in predicting the grade of the tumor. These parameters showcased robust capabilities in predicting multiple histopathological parameters when tested using machine learning algorithms.

Conclusion: Though textural analysis could not predict hormonal receptor status, lymphovascular invasion status, perineural invasion status, microcalcification status of tumor, and all the molecular subtypes of the tumor, it could predict the tumor's histologic type, triple-negative subtype, and score of the tumor noninvasively.

TITLE: Radiomics on spatial-temporal manifolds via Fokker-Planck dynamics

AUTHORS: Jack B Stevens, Breylon A Riley, Jihyeon Je, Yuan Gao, Chunhao Wang, Yvonne M Mowery, David M Brizel, Fang-Fang Yin, Jian-Guo Liu, Kyle J Lafata

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Background: Delta radiomics is a high-throughput computational technique used to describe quantitative changes in serial, time-series imaging by considering the relative change in radiomic features of images extracted at two distinct time points. Recent work has demonstrated a lack of prognostic signal of radiomic features extracted using this technique. We hypothesize that this lack of signal is due to the fundamental assumptions made when extracting features via delta radiomics, and that other methods should be investigated.

Purpose: The purpose of this work was to show a proof-of-concept of a new radiomics paradigm for sparse, time-series imaging data, where features are extracted from a spatial-temporal manifold modeling the time evolution between images, and to assess the prognostic value on patients with oropharyngeal cancer (OPC).

Methods: To accomplish this, we developed an algorithm to mathematically describe the relationship between two images acquired at timeand. These images serve as boundary conditions of a partial differential equation describing the transition from one image to the other. To solve this equation, we propagate the position and momentum of each voxel according to Fokker-Planck dynamics (i.e., a technique common in statistical mechanics). This transformation is driven by an underlying potential force uniquely determined by the equilibrium image. The solution generates a spatial-temporal manifold (3 spatial dimensions + time) from which we define dynamic radiomic features. First, our approach was numerically verified by stochastically sampling dynamic Gaussian processes of monotonically decreasing noise. The transformation from high to low noise was compared between our Fokker-Planck estimation and simulated ground-truth. To demonstrate feasibility and clinical impact, we applied our approach to18F-FDG-PET images to estimate early metabolic response of patients (n = 57) undergoing definitive (chemo)radiation for OPC. Images were acquired pre-treatment and 2-weeks intra-treatment (after 20 Gy). Dynamic radiomic features capturing changes in texture and morphology were then extracted. Patients were partitioned into two groups based on similar dynamic radiomic feature expression via k-means clustering and compared by Kaplan-Meier analyses with log-rank tests (p < 0.05). These results were compared to conventional delta radiomics to test the added value of our approach.

Results: Numerical results confirmed our technique can recover image noise characteristics given sparse input data as boundary conditions. Our technique was able to model tumor shrinkage and metabolic response. While no delta radiomics features proved prognostic, Kaplan-Meier analyses identified nine significant dynamic radiomic features. The most significant feature was Gray-Level-Size-Zone-Matrix gray-level variance (p = 0.011), which demonstrated prognostic improvement over its corresponding delta radiomic feature (p = 0.722).

Conclusions: We developed, verified, and demonstrated the prognostic value of a novel, physics-based radiomics approach over conventional delta radiomics via data assimilation of quantitative imaging and differential equations.

TITLE: The effect of harmonization on the variability of PET radiomic features extracted using various segmentation methods

AUTHORS: Seyyed Ali Hosseini, Isaac Shiri, Pardis Ghaffarian, Ghasem Hajianfar, Atlas Haddadi Avval, Milad Seyfi, Stijn Servaes, Pedro Rosa-Neto, Habib Zaidi, Mohammad Reza Ay

JOURNAL: Annals of nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: This study aimed to examine the robustness of positron emission tomography (PET) radiomic features extracted via different segmentation methods before and after ComBat harmonization in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

Methods: We included 120 patients (positive recurrence = 46 and negative recurrence = 74) referred for PET scanning as a routine part of their care. All patients had a biopsy-proven NSCLC. Nine segmentation methods were applied to each image, including manual delineation, K-means (KM), watershed, fuzzy-C-mean, region-growing, local active contour (LAC), and iterative thresholding (IT) with 40, 45, and 50% thresholds. Diverse image discretizations, both without a filter and with different wavelet decompositions, were applied to PET images. Overall, 6741 radiomic features were extracted from each image (749 radiomic features from each segmented area). Non-parametric empirical Bayes (NPEB) ComBat harmonization was used to harmonize the features. Linear Support Vector Classifier (LinearSVC) with L1 regularization For feature selection and Support Vector Machine classifier (SVM) with fivefold nested cross-validation was performed using StratifiedKFold with 'n_splits' set to 5 to predict recurrence in NSCLC patients and assess the impact of ComBat harmonization on the outcome.

Results: From 749 extracted radiomic features, 206 (27%) and 389 (51%) features showed excellent reliability (ICC ≥ 0.90) against segmentation method variation before and after NPEB ComBat harmonization, respectively. Among all, 39 features demonstrated poor reliability, which declined to 10 after ComBat harmonization. The 64 fixed bin widths (without any filter) and wavelets (LLL)-based radiomic features set achieved the best performance in terms of robustness against diverse segmentation techniques before and after ComBat harmonization. The first-order and GLRLM and also first-order and NGTDM feature families showed the largest number of robust features before and after ComBat harmonization, respectively. In terms of predicting recurrence in NSCLC, our findings indicate that using ComBat harmonization can significantly enhance machine learning outcomes, particularly improving the accuracy of watershed segmentation, which initially had fewer reliable features than manual contouring. Following the application of ComBat harmonization, the majority of cases saw substantial increase in sensitivity and specificity.

Conclusion: Radiomic features are vulnerable to different segmentation methods. ComBat harmonization might be considered a solution to overcome the poor reliability of radiomic features.

TITLE: Anatomical-guided attention enhances unsupervised PET image denoising performance

AUTHORS: Yuya Onishi, Fumio Hashimoto, Kibo Ote, Hiroyuki Ohba, Ryosuke Ota, Etsuji Yoshikawa, Yasuomi Ouchi

JOURNAL: Medical image analysis

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Although supervised convolutional neural networks (CNNs) often outperform conventional alternatives for denoising positron emission tomography (PET) images, they require many low- and high-quality reference PET image pairs. Herein, we propose an unsupervised 3D PET image denoising method based on an anatomical information-guided attention mechanism. The proposed magnetic resonance-guided deep decoder (MR-GDD) utilizes the spatial details and semantic features of MR-guidance image more effectively by introducing encoder-decoder and deep decoder subnetworks. Moreover, the specific shapes and patterns of the guidance image do not affect the denoised PET image, because the guidance image is input to the network through an attention gate. In a Monte Carlo simulation of [18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG), the proposed method achieved the highest peak signal-to-noise ratio and structural similarity (27.92 ± 0.44 dB/0.886 ± 0.007), as compared with Gaussian filtering (26.68 ± 0.10 dB/0.807 ± 0.004), image guided filtering (27.40 ± 0.11 dB/0.849 ± 0.003), deep image prior (DIP) (24.22 ± 0.43 dB/0.737 ± 0.017), and MR-DIP (27.65 ± 0.42 dB/0.879 ± 0.007). Furthermore, we experimentally visualized the behavior of the optimization process, which is often unknown in unsupervised CNN-based restoration problems. For preclinical (using [18F]FDG and [11C]raclopride) and clinical (using [18F]florbetapir) studies, the proposed method demonstrates state-of-the-art denoising performance while retaining spatial resolution and quantitative accuracy, despite using a common network architecture for various noisy PET images with 1/10th of the full counts. These results suggest that the proposed MR-GDD can reduce PET scan times and PET tracer doses considerably without impacting patients.

TITLE: Synthesis of pseudo-PET/CT fusion images in radiotherapy based on a new transformer model

AUTHORS: Hongfei Sun, Liting Chen, Jie Li, Zhi Yang, Jiarui Zhu, Zhongfei Wang, Ge Ren, Jing Cai, Lina Zhao

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Background: PET/CT and planning CT are commonly used medical images in radiotherapy for esophageal and nasopharyngeal cancer. However, repeated scans will expose patients to additional radiation doses and also introduce registration errors. This multimodal treatment approach is expected to be further improved.

Purpose: A new Transformer model is proposed to obtain pseudo-PET/CT fusion images for esophageal and nasopharyngeal cancer radiotherapy.

Methods: The data of 129 cases of esophageal cancer and 141 cases of nasopharyngeal cancer were retrospectively selected for training, validation, and testing. PET and CT images are used as input. Based on the Transformer model with a "focus-disperse" attention mechanism and multi-consistency loss constraints, the feature information in two images is effectively captured. This ultimately results in the synthesis of pseudo-PET/CT fusion images with enhanced tumor region imaging. During the testing phase, the accuracy of pseudo-PET/CT fusion images was verified in anatomy and dosimetry, and two prospective cases were selected for further dose verification.

Results: In terms of anatomical verification, the PET/CT fusion image obtained using the wavelet fusion algorithm was used as the ground truth image after correction by clinicians. The evaluation metrics, including peak signal-to-noise ratio, structural similarity index, mean absolute error, and normalized root mean square error, between the pseudo-fused images obtained based on the proposed model and ground truth, are represented by means (standard deviation). They are 37.82 (1.57), 95.23 (2.60), 29.70 (2.49), and 9.48 (0.32), respectively. These numerical values outperform those of the state-of-the-art deep learning comparative models. In terms of dosimetry validation, based on a 3%/2 mm gamma analysis, the average passing rates of global and tumor regions between the pseudo-fused images (with a PET/CT weight ratio of 2:8) and the planning CT images are 97.2% and 95.5%, respectively. These numerical outcomes are superior to those of pseudo-PET/CT fusion images with other weight ratios.

Conclusions: This pseudo-PET/CT fusion images obtained based on the proposed model hold promise as a new modality in the radiotherapy for esophageal and nasopharyngeal cancer.

TITLE: Hybrid method for estimating lung ventilation from CT by combining intensity and motion information

AUTHORS: Paris Tzitzimpasis, Mario Ries, Bas W Raaymakers, Cornel Zachiu

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Background: Functional lung imaging modalities allow for capturing regional lung ventilation information. Computed Tomography based ventilation imaging (CTVI) has been proposed as a surrogate modality that relies on time-resolved anatomical data and image processing. However, generating accurate ventilation maps using solely computed tomography (CT) image information remains a challenging task, due to the need to derive functional information of ventilation from anatomical observations.

Purpose: We introduce the hybrid estimation of computed tomography obtained respiratory function (HECTOR) method that consists of two components: a volume- and a density-based ventilation estimate. For the first component, a deformable image registration (DIR)-based solution for accurate volumetric CTVI generation is proposed, integrating the physical characteristics of the lung deformations in its design. For the second component, an already established air-tissue density model is used. Furthermore, a novel method is developed for combining the two components.

Methods: The proposed method consists of four principal steps: (1) Application of a specially tailored DIR algorithm to estimate respiratory motion between inhale and exhale phases. (2) Conversion of the motion information to volumetric change maps using a variation of the Jacobian determinant method. (3) Computation of a HU-based method that estimates the local product of air-tissue densities. (4) Combination of the metrics estimated in steps 2 and 3 by means of a smooth minimum function. The proposed approach is validated using the publicly available VAMPIRE dataset consisting of two subgroups: 25 subjects scanned with Galligas 4DPET/CT and 21 subjects scanned with DTPA-SPECT. Another dataset of 18 patients available at The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) was used for further validation. All datasets contain inhale/exhale CT scans paired with ground-truth ventilation images (RefVIs). The CTVIs generated by the proposed HECTOR method were tested against the RefVIs using the Spearman correlation coefficient and Dice overlap of low- and high-function lung (DSC-low and DSC-high, respectively).

Results: The proposed method achieved mean Spearman, DSC-high and DSC-low coefficients of 0.62, 0.55, and 0.59 on the Galligas PET subgroup and 0.49,0,48, and 0.50 on the DTPA-SPECT subgroup of the VAMPIRE dataset. This performance was better than the highest performing method reported in the original challenge. The same metrics for the TCIA dataset were 0.66, 0.60, and 0.60. The proposed hybrid ventilation method achieved higher Spearman correlation scores than the individual volume- and density-based components in all datasets. Additionally, the use of the specially tailored DIR algorithm was found to achieve higher scores than previously reported volume-based methods.

Conclusions: Our work provides a novel processing workflow for CT ventilation imaging that can consistently generate ventilation maps with high fidelity compared to reference approaches. This study also provides further insights into the benefits of combining different types of information to model the complex dynamics of respiratory function. Such information can be useful for potential applications in radiation therapy treatment planning and thoracic dose-response assessment.

TITLE: Using the coefficient of determination to identify injury regions after stroke in pre-clinical FDG-PET images

AUTHORS: Wuxian He, Hongtu Tang, Jia Li, Xiaoyan Shen, Xuechen Zhang, Chenrui Li, Huafeng Liu, Weichuan Yu

JOURNAL: Computers in biology and medicine

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Background: In the analysis of brain fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) images, intensity normalization is a necessary step to reduce inter-subject variability. However, the choice of the most appropriate normalization method in stroke studies remains unclear, as demonstrated by inconsistent findings in the literature.

Materials and methods: Here, we propose a regression- and single-subject-based model for analyzing FDG-PET images without intensity normalization. Two independent data sets were collected before and after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), with one comprising 120 rats and the other 96 rats. After data preprocessing, voxel intensities in the same region and hemisphere were paired before and after the MCAO scan. A linear regression model was applied to the paired data, and the coefficient of determination R2was calculated to measure the linearity. The R2values between the ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres were compared, and significant regions were defined as those with reduced linearity. Our method was compared with voxel-wise analysis under different intensity normalization methods and validated using the triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining data.

Results: The significant regions identified by the proposed method showed a large degree of overlap with the infarcted regions identified by TTC data, as measured by the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC). The average DSC of the proposed method was 59.7%, whereas the DSCs of the existing approaches ranged from 41.4%∼51.3%. Additional validation using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) demonstrated that the area under the curve (AUC) of the average ROC curves reached 0.84 using the proposed method, whereas existing methods achieved AUCs ranging from 0.77∼0.79. The identified regions were consistent across the two independent data sets, and some findings were corroborated by other publications.

Conclusions: The proposed model presents a novel quantitative approach for identifying injury regions post-stroke using FDG-PET images. The calculation does not require intensity normalization and can be applied to individual subjects. The method yields more sensitive results compared to existing identification methods.

ABSTRACT:
Dynamic 2-[18F] fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography (dFDG-PET) for human brain imaging has considerable clinical potential, yet its utilization remains limited. A key challenge in the quantitative analysis of dFDG-PET is characterizing a patient-specific blood input function, traditionally reliant on invasive arterial blood sampling. This research introduces a novel approach employing non-invasive deep learning model-based computations from the internal carotid arteries (ICA) with partial volume (PV) corrections, thereby eliminating the need for invasive arterial sampling. We present an end-to-end pipeline incorporating a 3D U-Net based ICA-net for ICA segmentation, alongside a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based MCIF-net for the derivation of a model-corrected blood input function (MCIF) with PV corrections. The developed 3D U-Net and RNN was trained and validated using a 5-fold cross-validation approach on 50 human brain FDG PET scans. The ICA-net achieved an average Dice score of 82.18% and an Intersection over Union of 68.54% across all tested scans. Furthermore, the MCIF-net exhibited a minimal root mean squared error of 0.0052. The application of this pipeline to ground truth data for dFDG-PET brain scans resulted in the precise localization of seizure onset regions, which contributed to a successful clinical outcome, with the patient achieving a seizure-free state after treatment. These results underscore the efficacy of the ICA-net and MCIF-net deep learning pipeline in learning the ICA structure's distribution and automating MCIF computation with PV corrections. This advancement marks a significant leap in non-invasive neuroimaging.

JOURNAL: Abdominal radiology (New York)

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: To evaluate robustness of a radiomics-based support vector machine (SVM) model for detection of visually occult PDA on pre-diagnostic CTs by simulating common variations in image acquisition and radiomics workflow using image perturbation methods.

Methods: Eighteen algorithmically generated-perturbations, which simulated variations in image noise levels (σ, 2σ, 3σ, 5σ), image rotation [both CT image and the corresponding pancreas segmentation mask by 45° and 90° in axial plane], voxel resampling (isotropic and anisotropic), gray-level discretization [bin width (BW) 32 and 64)], and pancreas segmentation (sequential erosions by 3, 4, 6, and 8 pixels and dilations by 3, 4, and 6 pixels from the boundary), were introduced to the original (unperturbed) test subset (n = 128; 45 pre-diagnostic CTs, 83 control CTs with normal pancreas). Radiomic features were extracted from pancreas masks of these additional test subsets, and the model's performance was compared vis-a-vis the unperturbed test subset.

Results: The model correctly classified 43 out of 45 pre-diagnostic CTs and 75 out of 83 control CTs in the unperturbed test subset, achieving 92.2% accuracy and 0.98 AUC. Model's performance was unaffected by a three-fold increase in noise level except for sensitivity declining to 80% at 3σ (p = 0.02). Performance remained comparable vis-a-vis the unperturbed test subset despite variations in image rotation (p = 0.99), voxel resampling (p = 0.25-0.31), change in gray-level BW to 32 (p = 0.31-0.99), and erosions/dilations up to 4 pixels from the pancreas boundary (p = 0.12-0.34).

Conclusion: The model's high performance for detection of visually occult PDA was robust within a broad range of clinically relevant variations in image acquisition and radiomics workflow.

TITLE: Performance assessment of the ALBIRA II pre-clinical SPECT S102 system for 99mTc imaging

AUTHORS: Ali Asgar Attarwala, Deni Hardiansyah, Chiara Romanó, Luis David Jiménez-Franco, Mareike Roscher, Björn Wängler, Gerhard Glatting

JOURNAL: Annals of nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Objective: The performance characteristics of the SPECT sub-system S102 of the ALBIRA II PET/SPECT/CT are analyzed for the 80 mm field of view (FOV) to evaluate the potential in-vivo imaging in rats, based on measurements of the system response for the commonly used Technetium-99 m (99mTc) in small animal imaging.

Methods: The ALBIRA II tri-modal µPET/SPECT/CT pre-clinical system (Bruker BioSpin, Ettlingen, Germany) was used. The SPECT modality is made up of two opposite gamma cameras (Version S102) with Sodium doped Cesium Iodide (CsI(Na)) single continuous crystal detectors coupled to position-sensitive photomultipliers (PSPMTs). Imaging was performed with the NEMA NU-4 image quality phantom (Data Spectrum Corporation, Durham, USA). Measurements were performed with a starting activity concentration of 4.76 MBq/mL99mTc. An energy window of 20% at 140 keV was selected in this study. The system offers a 20 mm, 40 mm, 60 mm and an 80 mm field of view (FOV) and in this study the 80 mm FOV was used for all the acquisitions. The data were reconstructed with an ordered subset expectation maximization (OSEM) algorithm. Sensitivity, spatial resolution, count rate linearity, convergence of the algorithm and the recovery coefficients (RC) were analyzed. All analyses were performed with PMOD and MATLAB software.

Results: The sensitivities measured at the center of the 80 mm FOV with the point source were 23.1 ± 0.3 cps/MBq (single pinhole SPH) and 105.6 ± 5.5 cps/MBq (multi pinhole MPH). The values for the axial, tangential and radial full width at half maximum (FWHM) were 2.51, 2.54, and 2.55 mm with SPH and 2.35, 2.44 and 2.32 mm with MPH, respectively. The corresponding RC values for the 5 mm, 4 mm, 3 mm and 2 mm rods were 0.60 ± 0.28, 0.61 ± 0.24, 0.29 ± 0.11 and 0.20 ± 0.06 with SPH and 0.56 ± 0.20, 0.50 ± 0.18, 0.38 ± 0.09 and 0.23 ± 0.06 with MPH. To obtain quantitative imaging data, the image reconstructions should be performed with 12 iterations.

Conclusion: The ALBIRA II preclinical SPECT sub-system S102 has a favorable sensitivity and spatial resolution for the 80 mm FOV setting for both the SPH and MPH configurations and is a valuable tool for small animal imaging.

TITLE: Image Denoising of Low-Dose PET Mouse Scans with Deep Learning: Validation Study for Preclinical Imaging Applicability

AUTHORS: Florence M Muller, Boris Vervenne, Jens Maebe, Eric Blankemeyer, Mark A Sellmyer, Rong Zhou, Joel S Karp, Christian Vanhove, Stefaan Vandenberghe

JOURNAL: Molecular imaging and biology

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Positron emission tomography (PET) image quality can be improved by higher injected activity and/or longer acquisition time, but both may often not be practical in preclinical imaging. Common preclinical radioactive doses (10 MBq) have been shown to cause deterministic changes in biological pathways. Reducing the injected tracer activity and/or shortening the scan time inevitably results in low-count acquisitions which poses a challenge because of the inherent noise introduction. We present an image-based deep learning (DL) framework for denoising lower count micro-PET images.

Procedures: For 36 mice, a 15-min [18F]FDG (8.15 ± 1.34 MBq) PET scan was acquired at 40 min post-injection on the Molecubes β-CUBE (in list mode). The 15-min acquisition (high-count) was parsed into smaller time fractions of 7.50, 3.75, 1.50, and 0.75 min to emulate images reconstructed at 50, 25, 10, and 5% of the full counts, respectively. A 2D U-Net was trained with mean-squared-error loss on 28 high-low count image pairs.

Results: The DL algorithms were visually and quantitatively compared to spatial and edge-preserving denoising filters; the DL-based methods effectively removed image noise and recovered image details much better while keeping quantitative (SUV) accuracy. The largest improvement in image quality was seen in the images reconstructed with 10 and 5% of the counts (equivalent to sub-1 MBq or sub-1 min mouse imaging). The DL-based denoising framework was also successfully applied on the NEMA-NU4 phantom and different tracer studies ([18F]PSMA, [18F]FAPI, and [68Ga]FAPI).

Conclusion: Visual and quantitative results support the superior performance and robustness in image denoising of the implemented DL models for low statistics micro-PET. This offers much more flexibility in optimizing preclinical, longitudinal imaging protocols with reduced tracer doses or shorter durations.

ABSTRACT:
Over the last years, the amount, variety, and complexity of neuroimaging data acquired in patients with brain tumors for routine clinical purposes and the resulting number of imaging parameters have substantially increased. Consequently, a timely and cost-effective evaluation of imaging data is hardly feasible without the support of methods from the field of artificial intelligence (AI). AI can facilitate and shorten various time-consuming steps in the image processing workflow, e.g., tumor segmentation, thereby optimizing productivity. Besides, the automated and computer-based analysis of imaging data may help to increase data comparability as it is independent of the experience level of the evaluating clinician. Importantly, AI offers the potential to extract new features from the routinely acquired neuroimages of brain tumor patients. In combination with patient data such as survival, molecular markers, or genomics, mathematical models can be generated that allow, for example, the prediction of treatment response or prognosis, as well as the noninvasive assessment of molecular markers. The subdiscipline of AI dealing with the computation, identification, and extraction of image features, as well as the generation of prognostic or predictive mathematical models, is termed radiomics. This review article summarizes the basics, the current workflow, and methods used in radiomics with a focus on feature-based radiomics in neuro-oncology and provides selected examples of its clinical application.

TITLE: TauIQ: A Canonical Image Based Algorithm to Quantify Tau PET Scans

AUTHORS: Alex Whittington, Roger N Gunn, Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Recently, AmyloidIQwas introduced as a new canonical image-based algorithm to quantify amyloid PET scans and demonstrated increased power over traditional SUV ratio (SUVR) approaches when assessed in cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses. We build further on this mathematical framework to develop a TauIQalgorithm for the quantitative analysis of the more complex spatial distribution displayed by tau PET radiotracers.Methods:Cross-sectional (n= 615) and longitudinal (n= 149)18F-flortaucipir data were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative along with necessary adjunct amyloid PET and T1-weighted structural MRI data. A subset of these data were used to derive a chronological tau dataset, using AmyloidIQanalysis of associated amyloid PET data to calculate the subject's temporal position in the canonical AD disease process, from which canonical images for the nonspecific and specific binding components of18F-flortaucipir in AD were calculated. These 2 canonical images were incorporated into the TauIQalgorithm that enables the quantification of both global and local tau outcome measures using an image-based regression and statistical parametric analysis of the initial residual image. Performance of the TauIQalgorithm was compared with SUVR approaches for cross-sectional analyses, longitudinal analyses, and correlation with clinical measures (Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale [ADAS-Cog], Clinical Dementia Rating scale-sum of boxes [CDR-SB], and Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE]).Results:TauIQsuccessfully calculated global tau load (TauL) in all 791 scans analyzed (range, -3.5% to 185.2%; mean ± SD, 23% ± 20.5%) with a nonzero additional local tau component being required in 31% of all scans (cognitively normal [CN], 22%; mild cognitive impairment [MCI], 35%; dementia, 72%). TauIQwas compared with the best SUVR approach in the cross-sectional analysis (TauLincrease in effect size: CN- vs. CN+, +45%; CN- vs. MCI+, -5.6%; CN- vs. dementia+, +2.3%) (+/- indicates amyloid-positive or -negative) and correlation with clinical scores (TauLincrease inr2: CDR-SB+, 7%; MMSE+, 38%; ADAS-Cog+, 0%). TauIQsubstantially outperformed SUVR approaches in the longitudinal analysis (TauIQincrease in power: CN+, >3.2-fold; MCI+, >2.2-fold; dementia+, >2.9-fold).Conclusion:TauLas calculated by TauIQprovides a superior approach for the quantification of tau PET data. In particular, it provides a substantial improvement in power for longitudinal analyses and the early detection of tau deposition and thus should have significant value for clinical imaging trials in AD that are investigating the attenuation of tau deposition with novel therapies.

TITLE: A computational approach for analysis of intratumoral heterogeneity and standardized uptake value in PET/CT images1

AUTHORS: Khalaf Alshamrani, Hassan A Alshamrani

JOURNAL: Journal of X-ray science and technology

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Background: By providing both functional and anatomical information from a single scan, digital imaging technologies like PET/CT and PET/MRI hybrids are gaining popularity in medical imaging industry. In clinical practice, the median value (SUVmed) receives less attention owing to disagreements surrounding what defines a lesion, but the SUVmax value, which is a semi-quantitative statistic used to analyse PET and PET/CT images, is commonly used to evaluate lesions.

Objective: This study aims to build an image processing technique with the purpose of automatically detecting and isolating lesions in PET/CT images, as well as measuring and assessing the SUVmed.

Methods: The pictures are separated into their respective lesions using mathematical morphology and the crescent region, which are both part of the image processing method. In this research, a total of 18 different pictures of lesions were evaluated.

Results: The findings of the study reveal that the threshold is satisfied by both the SUVmax and the SUVmed for most of the lesion types. However, in six instances, the SUVmax and SUVmed values are found to be in different courts.

Conclusion: The new information revealed by this study needs to be further investigated to determine if it has any practical value in diagnosing and monitoring lesions. However, results of this study suggest that SUVmed should receive more attention in the evaluation of lesions in PET and CT images.

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Center-specific effects in PET brain scans arise due to differences in technical and procedural aspects. This restricts the merging of data between centers and introduces source-specific bias.

Methods: We demonstrate the use of the recently proposed machine learning method Iterated Relevance Matrix Analysis (IRMA) for harmonization of center-specific effects in brainF-Fluorodeoxyglucose (F-FDG) PET scans. The center difference is learned by applying IRMA on PCA-based feature vectors of healthy controls (HC), resulting in a subspace, representing information not comparable between centers, and the remaining subspace, where no center differences are present. In this proof-of-concept study, we demonstrate the properties of the method using data from four centers. After center-harmonization, a Generalized Matrix Learning Vector Quantization (GMLVQ) model was trained to discriminate between Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and Dementia with Lewy Bodies.

Results: At the initial IRMA iteration, the system was able to determine the center origin of the four HC cohorts almost perfectly. The method required six iterations, corresponding to a six-dimensional subspace, to determine the entire center difference. An uncorrected disease classification model was highly biased to center-specific effects, creating a falsely inflated performance when applying internal (cross-) validation. The cross-validation performance of the center-harmonized model remained high, while it generalized significantly better to unseen test cohorts. Furthermore, the framework is highly transparent, providing analytic reconstructions of the correction and visualizations of the data in voxel space.

Conclusion: IRMA can be used to learn and disregard center-specific information in features extracted from brainF-FDG PET scans, while retaining disease-specific information.

TITLE: Age-related sensitivity deterioration evaluation of positron emission tomography utilizing cross-calibration factor measurement data

AUTHORS: Asuka Kikuchi, Shoichi Watanuki, Hiroshi Watabe, Manabu Tashiro

JOURNAL: Radiological physics and technology

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Age-related deterioration in positron emission tomography (PET) systems can be monitored using cross-calibration scans for scanner calibration. This study aimed to evaluate changes in the sensitivity of a PET system over time using routinely collected cross-calibration factor (CCF) measurement data and NEMA sensitivity measurement data acquired at our facility. We used CCF measurement data acquired over eight years, from 2016 to 2023. The count rates were calculated from raw data. The NEMA sensitivity measurements were also performed in 2017 and 2024 to compare with the sensitivities obtained from the CCF measurements. The PET images were reconstructed using the CCF data. A region of interest (ROI) was placed at the center of the PET images and count rates from the PET images were obtained. The sensitivity changes in the CCF data showed a linear decrease in sensitivity over eight years, with a mean annual reduction rate of approximately 2.0%. A comparison of the NEMA sensitivity measurements indicated a decrease in sensitivity, with a 12% reduction over eight eight years. The sensitivity was higher at the center of the axial field of view than at the edges. The ROI data also showed a linear decrease in sensitivity. This is consistent with the CCF data. Additionally, the coefficient of variation increased towards the edge of the slice. By utilizing the CCF measurement data, we obtained age-related changes in the PET system, suggesting that the PET system used in our facility may experience an annual sensitivity deterioration of approximately 2.0%.

TITLE: C2BA-UNet: A context-coordination multi-atlas boundary-aware UNet-like method for PET/CT images based tumor segmentation

AUTHORS: Shijie Luo, Huiyan Jiang, Meng Wang

JOURNAL: Computerized medical imaging and graphics : the official journal of the Computerized Medical Imaging Society

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Tumor segmentation is a necessary step in clinical processing that can help doctors diagnose tumors and plan surgical treatments. Since tumors are usually small, the locations and appearances vary substantially across individuals, and the contrast between tumors and adjacent normal tissues is low, tumor segmentation is still a challenging task. Although convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved good results in tumor segmentation, the information about tumor boundaries has been rarely explored. To solve the problem, this paper proposes a new method for automatic tumor segmentation in PET/CT images based on context-coordination and boundary-aware, termed as C2BA-UNet. We employ a UNet-like backbone network and replace the encoder with EfficientNet-B0 for efficiency. To acquire potential tumor boundaries, we propose a new multi-atlas boundary-aware (MABA) module based on gradient atlas, uncertainty atlas, and level set atlas, that focuses on uncertain regions between tumors and adjacent tissues. Furthermore, we propose a new context coordination module (CCM) to combine multi-scale context information with attention mechanism to optimize skip connection in high-level layers. To validate the superiority of our method, we conduct experiments on a publicly available soft tissue sarcoma (STS) dataset and a lymphoma dataset, and the results show our method is competitive with other comparison methods.

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Dose escalation to dominant intraprostatic lesions (DILs) is a novel treatment strategy to improve the treatment outcome of prostate radiation therapy. Treatment planning requires accurate and fast delineation of the prostate and DILs. In this study, a 3D cascaded scoring convolutional neural network is proposed to automatically segment the prostate and DILs from MRI.

Methods and materials: The proposed cascaded scoring convolutional neural network performs end-to-end segmentation by locating a region-of-interest (ROI), identifying the object within the ROI, and defining the target. A scoring strategy, which is learned to judge the segmentation quality of DIL, is integrated into cascaded convolutional neural network to solve the challenge of segmenting the irregular shapes of the DIL. To evaluate the proposed method, 77 patients who underwent MRI and PET/CT were retrospectively investigated. The prostate and DIL ground truth contours were delineated by experienced radiologists. The proposed method was evaluated with fivefold cross-validation and holdout testing.

Results: The average centroid distance, volume difference, and Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) value for prostate/DIL are 4.3 ± 7.5/3.73 ± 3.78 mm, 4.5 ± 7.9/0.41 ± 0.59 cc, and 89.6 ± 8.9/84.3 ± 11.9%, respectively. Comparable results were obtained in the holdout test. Similar or superior segmentation outcomes were seen when compared the results of the proposed method to those of competing segmentation approaches.

Conclusions: The proposed automatic segmentation method can accurately and simultaneously segment both the prostate and DILs. The intended future use for this algorithm is focal boost prostate radiation therapy.

TITLE: Texture Feature Comparison Between Step-and-Shoot and Continuous-Bed-Motion 18F-FDG PET

AUTHORS: Shozo Yamashita, Koichi Okuda, Tetsu Nakaichi, Haruki Yamamoto, Kunihiko Yokoyama

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear medicine technology

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Our objective was to investigate the differences in texture features between step-and-shoot (SS) and continuous-bed-motion (CBM) imaging in phantom and clinical studies.Methods:A National Electrical Manufacturers Association body phantom was filled with18F-FDG solution at a sphere-to-background ratio of 4:1. SS and CBM were performed using the same acquisition duration, and the data were reconstructed using 3-dimensional ordered-subset expectation maximization with time-of-flight algorithms. Texture features were extracted using the software LIFEx. A volume of interest was delineated on the 22-, 28-, and 37-mm spheres with a threshold of 42% of the maximum SUV. The voxel intensities were discretized using 2 resampling methods, namely a fixed bin size and a fixed bin number discretization. The discrete resampling values were set to 64 and 128. In total, 31 texture features were calculated with gray-level cooccurrence matrix (GLCM), gray-level run length matrix, neighborhood gray-level different matrix, and gray-level zone length matrix. The texture features of the SS and CBM images were compared for all settings using the pairedttest and the coefficient of variation. In a clinical study, 27 lesions from 20 patients were examined using the same acquisition and image processing as were used during the phantom study. The percentage difference (%Diff) and correlation between the texture features from SS and CBM images were calculated to evaluate agreement between the 2 scanning techniques.Results:In the phantom study, the 11 features exhibited no significant difference between SS and CBM images, and the coefficient of variation was no more than 10%, depending on resampling conditions, whereas entropy and dissimilarity from GLCM fulfilled the criteria for all settings. In the clinical study, the entropy and dissimilarity from GLCM exhibited a low %Diff and excellent correlation in all resampling conditions. The %Diff of entropy was lower than that of dissimilarity.Conclusion:Differences between the texture features of SS and CBM images varied depending on the type of feature. Because entropy for GLCM exhibits minimal differences between SS and CBM images irrespective of resampling conditions, entropy may be the optimal feature to reduce the differences between the 2 scanning techniques.

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) with [18F]florbetaben (FBB) is an established tool for detecting Aβ deposition in the brain in vivo based on visual assessment of PET scans. Quantitative measures are commonly used in the research context and allow continuous measurement of amyloid burden. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the robustness of FBB PET quantification.

Methods: This is a retrospective analysis of FBB PET images from 589 subjects. PET scans were quantified with 15 analytical methods using nine software packages (MIMneuro, Hermes BRASS, Neurocloud, Neurology Toolkit, statistical parametric mapping (SPM8), PMOD Neuro, CapAIBL, non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), AmyloidIQ) that used several metrics to estimate Aβ load (SUVR, centiloid, amyloid load, and amyloid index). Six analytical methods reported centiloid (MIMneuro, standard centiloid, Neurology Toolkit, SPM8 (PET only), CapAIBL, NMF). All results were quality controlled.

Results: The mean sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 96.1 ± 1.6%, 96.9 ± 1.0%, and 96.4 ± 1.1%, respectively, for all quantitative methods tested when compared to histopathology, where available. The mean percentage of agreement between binary quantitative assessment across all 15 methods and visual majority assessment was 92.4 ± 1.5%. Assessments of reliability, correlation analyses, and comparisons across software packages showed excellent performance and consistent results between analytical methods.

Conclusion: This study demonstrated that quantitative methods using both CE marked software and other widely available processing tools provided comparable results to visual assessments of FBB PET scans. Software quantification methods, such as centiloid analysis, can complement visual assessment of FBB PET images and could be used in the future for identification of early amyloid deposition, monitoring disease progression and treatment effectiveness.

TITLE: MSRA-Net: Tumor segmentation network based on Multi-scale Residual Attention

AUTHORS: Yuxuan Wu, Huiyan Jiang, Wenbo Pang

JOURNAL: Computers in biology and medicine

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Automatic Medical segmentation of medical images is an important part in the field of computer medical diagnosis, among which tumor segmentation is an important branch of medical image segmentation. Accurate automatic segmentation method is very important in medical diagnosis and treatment. Positron emission computed tomography (PET) and X-ray computed tomography (CT) images are widely used in medical image segmentation to help doctors accurately locate information such as tumor location and shape, providing metabolic and anatomical information, respectively. At present, PET/CT images have not been effectively combined in the research of medical image segmentation, and the complementary semantic information between the superficial and deep layers of neural network has not been ensured. To solve the above problems, this paper proposed a Multi-scale Residual Attention network (MSRA-Net) for tumor segmentation of PET/CT. We first use an attention-fusion based approach to automatically learn the tumor-related areas of PET images and weaken the irrelevant area. Then, the segmentation results of PET branch are processed to optimize the segmentation results of CT branch by using attention mechanism. The proposed neural network (MSRA-Net) can effectively fuse PET image and CT image, which can improve the precision of tumor segmentation by using complementary information of the multi-modal image, and reduce the uncertainty of single modal image segmentation. Proposed model uses multi-scale attention mechanism and residual module, which fuse multi-scale features to form complementary features of different scales. We compare with state-of-the-art medical image segmentation methods. The experiment showed that the Dice coefficient of the proposed network in soft tissue sarcoma and lymphoma datasets increased by 8.5% and 6.1% respectively compared with UNet, showing a significant improvement.

JOURNAL: Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Pancreatic cancer is a highly lethal disease with a poor prognosis. Its early diagnosis and accurate treatment mainly rely on medical imaging, so accurate medical image analysis is especially vital for pancreatic cancer patients. However, medical image analysis of pancreatic cancer is facing challenges due to ambiguous symptoms, high misdiagnosis rates, and significant financial costs. Artificial intelligence (AI) offers a promising solution by relieving medical personnel's workload, improving clinical decision-making, and reducing patient costs. This study focuses on AI applications such as segmentation, classification, object detection, and prognosis prediction across five types of medical imaging: CT, MRI, EUS, PET, and pathological images, as well as integrating these imaging modalities to boost diagnostic accuracy and treatment efficiency. In addition, this study discusses current hot topics and future directions aimed at overcoming the challenges in AI-enabled automated pancreatic cancer diagnosis algorithms.

TITLE: A different overview of staging PET/CT images in patients with esophageal cancer: the role of textural analysis with machine learning methods

AUTHORS: Nazlı Pınar Karahan Şen, Ayşegül Aksu, Gamze Çapa Kaya

JOURNAL: Annals of nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Objective: This study evaluates the ability of several machine learning (ML) algorithms, developed using volumetric and texture data extracted from baseline18F-FDG PET/CT studies performed initial staging of patient with esophageal cancer (EC), to predict survival and histopathology.

Methods: The initial staging18F-FDG PET/CT images obtained on newly diagnosed EC patients between January 2008 and June 2019 were evaluated using LIFEx software. A region of interest (ROI) of the primary tumor was created and volumetric and textural features were obtained. A significant relationship between these features and pathological subtypes, 1-year, and 5-year survival was investigated. Due to the nonhomogeneity of the data, nonparametric test (The Mann-Whitney U test) was used for each feature, in pairwise comparisons of independent variables. A p value of < 0.05 was considered significant. Receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis was performed for features with p < 0.05. Correlation between the significant features was evaluated with Spearman correlation test; features with correlation coefficient < 0.8 were evaluated with several ML algorithms.

Results: In predicting survival in a 1-year follow-up J48 was obtained as the most successful algorithm (AUC: 0.581, PRC: 0.565, MCC: 0.258, acc: 64.29%). 5-year survival results were more promising than 1-year survival results with (AUC: 0.820, PRC: 0.860, MCC: 271, acc: 81.36%) by logistic regression. It is revealed that the most successful algorithm was naive bayes (AUC: 0.680 PRC: 0.776, MCC: 0.298, acc: 82.66%) in the histopathological discrimination.

Conclusion: Texture analysis with ML algorithms could be predictive of overall survival and discriminating histopathological subtypes of EC.

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Spatial intratumoral heterogeneity poses a significant challenge for accurate response assessment in glioblastoma. Multimodal imaging coupled with advanced image analysis has the potential to unravel this response heterogeneity.

Methods: Based on automated tumor segmentation and longitudinal registration with follow-up imaging, we categorized contrast-enhancing voxels of 61 patients with suspected recurrence of glioblastoma into either true tumor progression (TP) or pseudoprogression (PsP). To allow the unbiased analysis of semantically related image regions, adjacent voxels with similar values of cerebral blood volume (CBV), FET-PET, and contrast-enhanced T1w were automatically grouped into supervoxels. We then extracted first-order statistics as well as texture features from each supervoxel. With these features, a Random Forest classifier was trained and validated employing a 10-fold cross-validation scheme. For model evaluation, the area under the receiver operating curve, as well as classification performance metrics were calculated.

Results: Our image analysis pipeline enabled reliable spatial assessment of tumor response. The predictive model reached an accuracy of 80.0% and a macro-weighted AUC of 0.875, which takes class imbalance into account, in the hold-out samples from cross-validation on supervoxel level. Analysis of feature importances confirmed the significant role of FET-PET-derived features. Accordingly, TP- and PsP-labeled supervoxels differed significantly in their 10th and 90th percentile, as well as the median of tumor-to-background normalized FET-PET. However, CBV- and T1c-related features also relevantly contributed to the model's performance.

Conclusion: Disentangling the intratumoral heterogeneity in glioblastoma holds immense promise for advancing precise local response evaluation and thereby also informing more personalized and localized treatment strategies in the future.

TITLE: Automatic cervical tumors segmentation in PET/MRI by parallel encoder U-net

AUTHORS: Shuai Liu, Zheng Tan, Tan Gong, Xiaoying Tang, Hongzan Sun, Fei Shang

JOURNAL: Radiation oncology (London, England)

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Background: Automatic segmentation of cervical tumors is important in quantitative analysis and radiotherapy planning.

Methods: A parallel encoder U-Net (PEU-Net) integrating the multi-modality information of PET/MRI was proposed to segment cervical tumor, which consisted of two parallel encoders with the same structure for PET and MR images. The features of the two modalities were extracted separately and fused at each layer of the decoder. Res2Net module on skip connection aggregated the features of various scales and refined the segmentation performance. PET/MRI images of 165 patients with cervical cancer were included in this study. U-Net, TransUNet, and nnU-Net with single or multi-modality (PET or/and T2WI) input were used for comparison. The Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) with volume data, DSC and the 95th percentile of Hausdorff distance (HD95) with tumor slices were calculated to evaluate the performance.

Results: The proposed PEU-Net exhibited the best performance (DSC3d: 0.726 ± 0.204, HD95: 4.603 ± 4.579 mm), DSC2d(0.871 ± 0.113) was comparable to the best result of TransUNet with PET/MRI (0.873 ± 0.125).

Conclusions: The networks with multi-modality input outperformed those with single-modality images as input. The results showed that the proposed PEU-Net could use multi-modality information more effectively through the redesigned structure and achieved competitive performance.

AUTHORS: Jun Yeon Won, Guen Bae Ko, Kyeong Yun Kim, Haewook Park, Seungeun Lee, Jeong-Whan Son, Jae Sung Lee

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
In this study, we propose a linear field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-based charge measurement method by combining a charge-to-time converter (QTC) with a single-ended memory interface (SeMI) input receiver. The QTC automatically converts the input charge into a dual-slope pulse, which has a width proportional to the input charge. Dual-slope pulses are directly digitized by the FPGA input/output (I/O) buffers configured with SeMI input receivers. A proof-of-concept comparator-less QTC/SeMI data acquisition (DAQ) system, consisting of 132 energy and 33 timing channels, was developed and applied to a prototype brain-dedicated positron emission tomography (PET) scanner. The PET scanner consisted of 14 sectors, each containing 2 × 1 block detectors, and each block detector yielded four energy signals and one timing signal. Because a single QTC/SeMI DAQ system can receive signals from up to eight sectors, two QTC/SeMI DAQ systems connected using high-speed gigabit transceivers were used to acquire data from the PET scanner. All crystals in the PET block detectors, consisting of dual-layer stacked lutetium oxyorthosilicate (LSO) scintillation crystal and silicon photomultiplier arrays, were clearly resolved in the flood maps with an excellent energy resolution. The PET images of hot-rod, cylindrical, and two-dimensional Hoffman brain phantoms were also acquired using the prototype PET scanner and two QTC/SeMI DAQ systems.

ABSTRACT:
Multi-modal medical image segmentation is a crucial task in oncology that enables the precise localization and quantification of tumors. The aim of this work is to present a meta-analysis of the use of multi-modal medical Transformers for medical image segmentation in oncology, specifically focusing on multi-parametric MR brain tumor segmentation (BraTS2021), and head and neck tumor segmentation using PET-CT images (HECKTOR2021). The multi-modal medical Transformer architectures presented in this work exploit the idea of modality interaction schemes based on visio-linguistic representations: (i) single-stream, where modalities are jointly processed by one Transformer encoder, and (ii) multiple-stream, where the inputs are encoded separately before being jointly modeled. A total of fourteen multi-modal architectures are evaluated using different ranking strategies based on dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and average symmetric surface distance (ASSD) metrics. In addition, cost indicators such as the number of trainable parameters and the number of multiply-accumulate operations (MACs) are reported. The results demonstrate that multi-path hybrid CNN-Transformer-based models improve segmentation accuracy when compared to traditional methods, but come at the cost of increased computation time and potentially larger model size.

JOURNAL: Annals of nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: To investigate the optimal dual-time-point (DTP) approaches using dynamic68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT imaging to generate parametric images for prostate cancer patients.

Methods: Fifteen patients with prostate cancer were intravenously administered68Ga-PSMA-11 of 181.9 ± 47.2 MBq, followed by an immediate 60 min dynamic PET/CT scan. List-mode data were reconstructed into 25 timeframes (6 × 10 s, 8 × 30 s, and 11 × 300 s) and corrected for motion and partial volume effect. DTP parametric images were generated using different interval time points of 5 min and 10 min, with a minimum of 30 min time interval. Net influx rates (Ki) were calculated through the fitting of a single irreversible two-tissue compartmental model. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) values between DTP protocols and 60 min Kiwere obtained. Lesion-to-background ratios (LBRs) of Kiand standardized uptake value (SUV) images in each DTP protocol were determined.

Results: The DTP protocol of 5-10 min with a 40-45 min interval showed the highest ICC of 0.988 compared with the 60 min Ki, whereas the ICC values for the intervals of 0-5 min with 55-60 min and 0-10 min with 50-60 min were 0.941. The LBRs of the 60 min Ki, 5-10 min with 40-45 min Ki, 0-5 min with 55-60 min Ki, 0-10 min with 50-60 min Ki, SUVmean, and SUVmaximages were 29.53 ± 27.33, 13.05 ± 15.28, 45.15 ± 53.11, 45.52 ± 70.31, 19.77 ± 23.43, and 25.06 ± 30.07, respectively.

Conclusion: The 0-5 min with 55-60 min DTP parametric imaging exhibits a comparable Kito 60 min parametric imaging and remarkable image quality and contrast than SUV imaging, enhancing prostate cancer diagnosis while maintaining time efficiency.

TITLE: AI-driven attenuation correction for brain PET/MRI: Clinical evaluation of a dementia cohort and importance of the training group size

AUTHORS: Claes Nøhr Ladefoged, Adam Espe Hansen, Otto Mølby Henriksen, Frederik Jager Bruun, Live Eikenes, Silje Kjærnes Øen, Anna Karlberg, Liselotte Højgaard, Ian Law, Flemming Littrup Andersen

JOURNAL: NeuroImage

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Introduction: Robust and reliable attenuation correction (AC) is a prerequisite for accurate quantification of activity concentration. In combined PET/MRI, AC is challenged by the lack of bone signal in the MRI from which the AC maps has to be derived. Deep learning-based image-to-image translation networks present itself as an optimal solution for MRI-derived AC (MR-AC). High robustness and generalizability of these networks are expected to be achieved through large training cohorts. In this study, we implemented an MR-AC method based on deep learning, and investigated how training cohort size, transfer learning, and MR input affected robustness, and subsequently evaluated the method in a clinical setup, with the overall aim to explore if this method could be implemented in clinical routine for PET/MRI examinations.

Methods: A total cohort of 1037 adult subjects from the Siemens Biograph mMR with two different software versions (VB20P and VE11P) was used. The software upgrade included updates to all MRI sequences. The impact of training group size was investigated by training a convolutional neural network (CNN) on an increasing training group size from 10 to 403. The ability to adapt to changes in the input images between software versions were evaluated using transfer learning from a large cohort to a smaller cohort, by varying training group size from 5 to 91 subjects. The impact of MRI sequence was evaluated by training three networks based on the Dixon VIBE sequence (DeepDixon), T1-weighted MPRAGE (DeepT1), and ultra-short echo time (UTE) sequence (DeepUTE). Blinded clinical evaluation relative to the reference low-dose CT (CT-AC) was performed for DeepDixon in 104 independent 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose ([18F]FDG) PET patient studies performed for suspected neurodegenerative disorder using statistical surface projections.

Results: Robustness increased with group size in the training data set: 100 subjects were required to reduce the number of outliers compared to a state-of-the-art segmentation-based method, and a cohort >400 subjects further increased robustness in terms of reduced variation and number of outliers. When using transfer learning to adapt to changes in the MRI input, as few as five subjects were sufficient to minimize outliers. Full robustness was achieved at 20 subjects. Comparable robust and accurate results were obtained using all three types of MRI input with a bias below 1% relative to CT-AC in any brain region. The clinical PET evaluation using DeepDixon showed no clinically relevant differences compared to CT-AC.

Conclusion: Deep learning based AC requires a large training cohort to achieve accurate and robust performance. Using transfer learning, only five subjects were needed to fine-tune the method to large changes to the input images. No clinically relevant differences were found compared to CT-AC, indicating that clinical implementation of our deep learning-based MR-AC method will be feasible across MRI system types using transfer learning and a limited number of subjects.

TITLE: Real-time marker-less tumor tracking with TOF PET: in silico feasibility study

AUTHORS: Xinyi Cheng, Dongxu Yang, Yuncheng Zhong, Yiping Shao

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Purpose.Although positron emission tomography (PET) can provide a functional image of static tumors for RT guidance, it's conventionally very challenging for PET to track a moving tumor in real-time with a multiple frame/s sampling rate. In this study, we developed a novel method to enable PET based three-dimension (3D) real-time marker-less tumor tracking (RMTT) and demonstrated its feasibility with a simulation study.Methods.For each line-of-response (LOR) acquired, its positron-electron annihilation position is calculated based on the time difference between the two gamma interactions detected by the TOF PET detectors. The accumulation of these annihilation positions from data acquired within a single sampling frame forms a coarsely measured 3D distribution of positron-emitter radiotracer uptakes of the lung tumor and other organs and tissues (background). With clinically relevant tumor size and sufficient differential radiotracer uptake concentrations between the tumor and background, the high-uptake tumor can be differentiated from the surrounding low-uptake background in the measured distribution of radiotracer uptakes. With a volume-of-interest (VOI) that closely encloses the tumor, the count-weighted centroid of the annihilation positions within the VOI can be calculated as the tumor position. All these data processes can be conducted online. The feasibility of the new method was investigated with a simulated cardiac-torso digital phantom and stationary dual-panel TOF PET detectors to track a 28 mm diameter lung tumor with a 4:1 tumor-to-background18FDG activity concentration ratio.Results.The initial study shows TOF PET based RMTT can achieve <2.0 mm tumor tracking accuracy with 5 frame s-1sampling rate under the simulated conditions. In comparison, using reconstructed PET images to track a similar size tumor would require >30 s acquisition time to achieve the same tracking accuracy.Conclusion.With the demonstrated feasibility, the new method may enable TOF PET based RMTT for practical RT applications.

TITLE: Test for shortening the computation time for imaging of appearance time for cerebral blood using H215O and positron emission tomography

ABSTRACT:
Objective: Delayed appearance of blood in the brain may be a pathophysiological indicator of stenosis or occlusion. Image computation for blood appearance generally requires considerable time. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to shorten the computation time using several algorithms and tested their accuracy and precision using examination data and simulations, as well as the computation time.

Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the images of patients with suspected cerebrovascular disorders who underwent PET study with15O-labeled tracers. The blood appearance time images were computed by fitting a stepwise time-shifted tissue curve and applying a single-tissue compartment model with several modes of fixing or not fixing the washout rate and/or blood volume terms. The appearance times in images for these modes were compared with the time obtained by ROI-based non-linear fitting in several brain regions. The effects of noise and parameter fixation are assessed using a simulation study.

Results: The computation time was 28.2 ± 6.2 min, 16.6 ± 3.9 min, and 2.6 ± 1.1 min for modes without fixing, with fixing blood volume, and washout rate, respectively. The mean difference in the appearance time against ROI-based non-linear fitting was less than 1 s with a standard deviation (SD) of approximately 2.5 s for those modes. The images obtained were similar for all three modes. The simulation showed that SD on the estimated appearance times were acceptable, namely < 1.5 s, for these modes.

Conclusion: This study suggests the possibility of visualizing appearance time images in the brain with a reasonable computation time of approximately 2.5 min at the minimum and 30 min at the most.

TITLE: Development of a deep learning method for CT-free correction for an ultra-long axial field of view PET scanner

AUTHORS: Song Xue, Karl Peter Bohn, Rui Guo, Hasan Sari, Marco Viscione, Axel Rominger, Biao Li, Kuangyu Shi

JOURNAL: Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society. IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society. Annual International Conference

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Introduction: The possibility of low-dose positron emission tomography (PET) imaging using high sensitivity long axial field of view (FOV) PET/computed tomography (CT) scanners makes CT a critical radiation burden in clinical applications. Artificial intelligence has shown the potential to generate PET images from non-corrected PET images. Our aim in this work is to develop a CT-free correction for a long axial FOV PET scanner.

Methods: Whole body PET images of 165 patients scanned with a digital regular FOV PET scanner (Biograph Vision 600 (Siemens Healthineers) in Shanghai and Bern) was included for the development and testing of the deep learning methods. Furthermore, the developed algorithm was tested on data of 7 patients scanned with a long axial FOV scanner (Biograph Vision Quadra, Siemens Healthineers). A 2D generative adversarial network (GAN) was developed featuring a residual dense block, which enables the model to fully exploit hierarchical features from all network layers. The normalized root mean squared error (NRMSE) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), were calculated to evaluate the results generated by deep learning.

Results: The preliminary results showed that, the developed deep learning method achieved an average NRMSE of 0.4±0.3% and PSNR of 51.4±6.4 for the test on Biograph Vision, and an average NRMSE of 0.5±0.4% and PSNR of 47.9±9.4 for the validation on Biograph Vision Quadra, after applied transfer learning.

Conclusion: The developed deep learning method shows the potential for CT-free AI-correction for a long axial FOV PET scanner. Work in progress includes clinical assessment of PET images by independent nuclear medicine physicians. Training and fine-tuning with more datasets will be performed to further consolidate the development.

JOURNAL: Nuclear medicine communications

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: This study demonstrates the feasibility and benefits of using a deep learning-based approach for attenuation correction in [ 68 Ga]Ga-PSMA PET scans.

Methods: A dataset of 700 prostate cancer patients (mean age: 67.6 ± 5.9 years, range: 45-85 years) who underwent [ 68 Ga]Ga-PSMA PET/computed tomography was collected. A deep learning model was trained to perform attenuation correction on these images. Quantitative accuracy was assessed using clinical data from 92 patients, comparing the deep learning-based attenuation correction (DLAC) to computed tomography-based PET attenuation correction (PET-CTAC) using mean error, mean absolute error, and root mean square error based on standard uptake value. Clinical evaluation was conducted by three specialists who performed a blinded assessment of lesion detectability and overall image quality in a subset of 50 subjects, comparing DLAC and PET-CTAC images.

Results: The DLAC model yielded mean error, mean absolute error, and root mean square error values of -0.007 ± 0.032, 0.08 ± 0.033, and 0.252 ± 125 standard uptake value, respectively. Regarding lesion detection and image quality, DLAC showed superior performance in 16 of the 50 cases, while in 56% of the cases, the images generated by DLAC and PET-CTAC were found to have closely comparable quality and lesion detectability.

Conclusion: This study highlights significant improvements in image quality and lesion detection capabilities through the integration of DLAC in [ 68 Ga]Ga-PSMA PET imaging. This innovative approach not only addresses challenges such as bladder radioactivity but also represents a promising method to minimize patient radiation exposure by integrating low-dose computed tomography and DLAC, ultimately improving diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes.

TITLE: Diagnostic performance of a deep-learning model using 18F-FDG PET/CT for evaluating recurrence after radiation therapy in patients with lung cancer

AUTHORS: Changhwan Sung, Jungsu S Oh, Byung Soo Park, Su Ssan Kim, Si Yeol Song, Jong Jin Lee

JOURNAL: Annals of nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Objective: We developed a deep learning model for distinguishing radiation therapy (RT)-related changes and tumour recurrence in patients with lung cancer who underwent RT, and evaluated its performance.

Methods: We retrospectively recruited 308 patients with lung cancer with RT-related changes observed on18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT) performed after RT. Patients were labelled as positive or negative for tumour recurrence through histologic diagnosis or clinical follow-up after18F-FDG PET/CT. A two-dimensional (2D) slice-based convolutional neural network (CNN) model was created with a total of 3329 slices as input, and performance was evaluated with five independent test sets.

Results: For the five independent test sets, the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic curve, sensitivity, and specificity were in the range of 0.98-0.99, 95-98%, and 87-95%, respectively. The region determined by the model was confirmed as an actual recurred tumour through the explainable artificial intelligence (AI) using gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM).

Conclusion: The 2D slice-based CNN model using18F-FDG PET imaging was able to distinguish well between RT-related changes and tumour recurrence in patients with lung cancer.

TITLE: APU-Net: An Attention Mechanism Parallel U-Net for Lung Tumor Segmentation

AUTHORS: Tao Zhou, YaLi Dong, HuiLing Lu, XiaoMin Zheng, Shi Qiu, SenBao Hou

JOURNAL: BioMed research international

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Lung cancer is one of the malignant tumors with high morbidity and mortality, and lung nodules are the early stages of lung cancer. The symptoms of pulmonary nodules are not obvious in the clinic, and the optimal treatment time is missed due to the missed diagnosis in the clinic. A parallel U-Net network called APU-Net is proposed. Firstly, two parallel U-Net networks are used to extract the features of different modalities. Among them, the subnetwork UNet_B extracts the CT image features, and the subnetwork UNet_A consists of two encoders to extract the PET/CT and PET image features. Secondly, multimodal feature extraction blocks are used to extract features for PET/CT and PET images in UNet_B network. Thirdly, a hybrid attention mechanism is added to the encoding paths of the UNet_A and UNet_B. Finally, a multiscale feature aggregation block is used for extracting feature maps of different scales of decoding path. On the lung tumor18FDGPET/CT multimodal medical images dataset, experiments' results show that the DSC, Recall, VOE, and RVD coefficients of APU-Net are 96.86%, 97.53%, 3.18%, and 3.29%, respectively. APU-Net can improve the segmentation accuracy of the adhesion between the lesion of complex shape and the normal tissue. This has positive significance for computer-aided diagnosis.

TITLE: Assessment of deep learning-based PET attenuation correction frameworks in the sinogram domain

AUTHORS: Hossein Arabi, Habib Zaidi

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
This study set out to investigate various deep learning frameworks for PET attenuation correction in the sinogram domain. Different models for both time-of-flight (TOF) and non-TOF PET emission data were implemented, including direct estimation of the attenuation corrected (AC) emission sinograms from the nonAC sinograms, estimation of the attenuation correction factors (ACFs) from PET emission data, correction of scattered photons prior to training of the models, and separate training of the models for each segment of the emission sinograms. A segmentation-based 2-class AC map was included as a bottom-line technique for comparison of the different models considering PET/CT AC as reference. Fifty clinical TOF PET/CT brain scans were employed for training whereas 20 were used for evaluation of the models. Quantitative analysis of the resulting PET images was carried out through region-wise standardized uptake value (SUV) bias calculation. The models relying on TOF information significantly outperformed the nonTOF models as well as the segmentation-based AC map resulting in maximum SUV bias of 6.5%, 9.5%, and 14.0%, respectively. Estimation of ACFs from either TOF or nonTOF PET emission data was very sensitive to prior scatter correction. However, direct estimation of AC sinograms from nonAC sinograms revealed no sensitivity to scatter correction, thus obviating the need for prior scatter estimation. For TOF PET data, though direct prediction of the AC sinograms does not require prior estimation of scattered photons, it requires input/output channels equal to the number of TOF bins which might be computationally or memory-wise expensive. Prediction of the ACF matrices from TOF emission data is less demanding in terms of memory as it requires only a single channel for output. AC in the sinogram domain of TOF PET data exhibited superior performance compared to both nonTOF and segmentation-based methods. However, such models require multiple input/output channels.

TITLE: Enhancing the reliability of deep learning-based head and neck tumour segmentation using uncertainty estimation with multi-modal images

AUTHORS: Jintao Ren, Jonas Teuwen, Jasper Nijkamp, Mathis Rasmussen, Zeno Gouw, Jesper Grau Eriksen, Jan-Jakob Sonke, Stine Korreman

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Objective.Deep learning shows promise in autosegmentation of head and neck cancer (HNC) primary tumours (GTV-T) and nodal metastases (GTV-N). However, errors such as including non-tumour regions or missing nodal metastases still occur. Conventional methods often make overconfident predictions, compromising reliability. Incorporating uncertainty estimation, which provides calibrated confidence intervals can address this issue. Our aim was to investigate the efficacy of various uncertainty estimation methods in improving segmentation reliability. We evaluated their confidence levels in voxel predictions and ability to reveal potential segmentation errors.Approach.We retrospectively collected data from 567 HNC patients with diverse cancer sites and multi-modality images (CT, PET, T1-, and T2-weighted MRI) along with their clinical GTV-T/N delineations. Using the nnUNet 3D segmentation pipeline, we compared seven uncertainty estimation methods, evaluating them based on segmentation accuracy (Dice similarity coefficient, DSC), confidence calibration (Expected Calibration Error, ECE), and their ability to reveal segmentation errors (Uncertainty-Error overlap using DSC, UE-DSC).Main results.Evaluated on the hold-out test dataset (n= 97), the median DSC scores for GTV-T and GTV-N segmentation across all uncertainty estimation methods had a narrow range, from 0.73 to 0.76 and 0.78 to 0.80, respectively. In contrast, the median ECE exhibited a wider range, from 0.30 to 0.12 for GTV-T and 0.25 to 0.09 for GTV-N. Similarly, the median UE-DSC also ranged broadly, from 0.21 to 0.38 for GTV-T and 0.22 to 0.36 for GTV-N. A probabilistic network-PhiSeg method consistently demonstrated the best performance in terms of ECE and UE-DSC.Significance.Our study highlights the importance of uncertainty estimation in enhancing the reliability of deep learning for autosegmentation of HNC GTV. The results show that while segmentation accuracy can be similar across methods, their reliability, measured by calibration error and uncertainty-error overlap, varies significantly. Used with visualisation maps, these methods may effectively pinpoint uncertainties and potential errors at the voxel level.

TITLE: Predicting lymph node metastasis in patients with oropharyngeal cancer by using a convolutional neural network with associated epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty

AUTHORS: Michael Dohopolski, Liyuan Chen, David Sher, Jing Wang

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
There can be significant uncertainty when identifying cervical lymph node (LN) metastases in patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) despite the use of modern imaging modalities such as positron emission tomography (PET) and computed tomography (CT) scans. Grossly involved LNs are readily identifiable during routine imaging, but smaller and less PET-avid LNs are harder to classify. We trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect malignant LNs in patients with OPSCC and used quantitative measures of uncertainty to identify the most reliable predictions. Our dataset consisted of images of 791 LNs from 129 patients with OPSCC who had preoperative PET/CT imaging and detailed pathological reports after neck dissections. These LNs were segmented on PET/CT imaging and then labeled according to the pathology reports. An AlexNet-like CNN was trained to classify LNs as malignant or benign. We estimated epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty by using dropout variational inference and test-time augmentation, respectively. CNN performance was stratified according to the median epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty values calculated using the validation cohort. Our model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of 0.99 on the testing dataset. Sensitivity and specificity were 0.94 and 0.90, respectively. Epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty values were statistically larger for false negative and false positive predictions than for true negative and true positive predictions (p < 0.001). Model sensitivity and specificity were 1.0 and 0.98, respectively, for cases with epistemic uncertainty lower than the median value of the incorrect predictions in the validation dataset. For cases with higher epistemic uncertainty, sensitivity and specificity were 0.67 and 0.41, respectively. Model sensitivity and specificity were 1.0 and 0.98, respectively, for cases with aleatoric uncertainty lower than the median value of the incorrect predictions in the validation dataset. For cases with higher aleatoric uncertainty, sensitivity and specificity were 0.67 and 0.37, respectively. We used a CNN to predict the malignant status of LNs in patients with OPSCC with high accuracy, and we showed that uncertainty can be used to quantify a prediction's reliability. Assigning measures of uncertainty to predictions could improve the accuracy of LN classification by efficiently identifying instances where expert evaluation is needed to corroborate a model's prediction.

TITLE: Baseline metabolic tumor volume calculation using different SUV thresholding methods in Hodgkin lymphoma patients: interobserver agreement and reproducibility across software platforms

JOURNAL: Nuclear medicine communications

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Aim: Although it is not yet used in clinical practice, metabolic tumor volume (MTV) assessed on the baseline FDG-PET has shown consistent prognostic value in various lymphoma types. The aim of our study was to compare interobserver agreement and reproducibility across platforms of MTV calculation using different SUV thresholding methods in a large series of patients with newly diagnosed Hodgkin lymphoma.

Materials and methods: We retrospectively studied 121 patients. MTV at baseline FDG-PET was independently computed by three readers with three programs of semi-automatic segmentation, Fiji, LifeX, and Accurate. MTV measurement was performed with different thresholds: SUV >2.5, SUV >4, and SUV >41% of SUV max.

Results: At inter-observer agreement analysis all Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICCs) were excellent (ICC >0.9), except for Accurate SUV >41% of SUV max (ICC = 0.8). The highest correlations were obtained at the SUV >4 threshold. The second best was SUV >2.5 threshold. Regarding reproducibility across software, we found statistically significant differences between Fiji versus LifeX and Accurate at fixed thresholds and between LifeX and Accurate at SUV >41% of SUV max, while no significant differences emerged between LifeX and Accurate using fixed thresholds.

Conclusion: The three SUV thresholds studied are all suitable for MTV calculation in terms of reproducibility. The best reproducibility is achieved using fixed thresholds, both SUV >4 and SUV >2.5. If more than one software has to be used in a study, we suggest the use of fixed thresholds and the platforms LifeX and Accurate.

JOURNAL: NeuroImage

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Background: The lack of standardization of intensity normalization methods and its unknown effect on the quantification output is recognized as a major drawback for the harmonization of brain FDG-PET quantification protocols. The aim of this work is the ground truth-based evaluation of different intensity normalization methods on brain FDG-PET quantification output.

Methods: Realistic FDG-PET images were generated using Monte Carlo simulation from activity and attenuation maps directly derived from 25 healthy subjects (adding theoretical relative hypometabolisms on 6 regions of interest and for 5 hypometabolism levels). Single-subject statistical parametric mapping (SPM) was applied to compare each simulated FDG-PET image with a healthy database after intensity normalization based on reference regions methods such as the brain stem (RRBS), cerebellum (RRC) and the temporal lobe contralateral to the lesion (RRTL), and data-driven methods, such as proportional scaling (PS), histogram-based method (HN) and iterative versions of both methods (iPS and iHN). The performance of these methods was evaluated in terms of the recovery of the introduced theoretical hypometabolic pattern and the appearance of unspecific hypometabolic and hypermetabolic findings.

Results: Detected hypometabolic patterns had significantly lower volumes than the introduced hypometabolisms for all intensity normalization methods particularly for slighter reductions in metabolism . Among the intensity normalization methods, RRC and HN provided the largest recovered hypometabolic volumes, while the RRBS showed the smallest recovery. In general, data-driven methods overcame reference regions and among them, the iterative methods overcame the non-iterative ones. Unspecific hypermetabolic volumes were similar for all methods, with the exception of PS, where it became a major limitation (up to 250 cm3) for extended and intense hypometabolism. On the other hand, unspecific hypometabolism was similar far all methods, and usually solved with appropriate clustering.

Conclusions: Our findings showed that the inappropriate use of intensity normalization methods can provide remarkable bias in the detected hypometabolism and it represents a serious concern in terms of false positives. Based on our findings, we recommend the use of histogram-based intensity normalization methods. Reference region methods performance was equivalent to data-driven methods only when the selected reference region is large and stable.

TITLE: PET image nonuniformity texture features for metastasis risk prediction in osteosarcoma

AUTHORS: Muath Almaslamani, Byung-Hyun Byun, Kanghyon Song, Chang-Bae Kong, Sang-Keun Woo

JOURNAL: Nuclear medicine communications

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Objective: PET image analysis provides tumor heterogeneity data related to neoadjuvant chemotherapy response (NACR) and metastatic risk in osteosarcoma. Ki-67 expression is used to predict metastasis. The accuracy of prediction models with image quantitative features can be improved by including genetic information. Here, we aimed to evaluate the accuracy of a combination of heterogeneous 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET image texture features and Ki-67 expression as predictive indicators of metastasis.

Methods: PET images and clinical data of 82 patients with osteosarcoma before and after treatment were collected. Quantitative features were extracted from the PET images obtained before treatment, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for NACR and metastatic event was calculated. Relative risk and odds analyses of the quantitative features of the entire image were performed. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed to determine the relationship between image quantitative features and clinical information. The machine learning prediction model was evaluated using valid image quantitative features and various algorithms of the univariate analysis.

Results: Forty-seven image textures were obtained. The AUC values were 0.504-0.62 for NACR and 0.510-0.598 for metastatic events. The NACR and metastatic risk were related to the gray-level run length matrix (GLRLM) run length nonuniformity (RLNU) (relative risk: 1.3846, P = 0.0138 for NACR; relative risk: 2.1284, P = 0.049 for metastatic event) in the univariate analysis. The accuracy of the prediction model using the random forest algorithm with GLRLM RLNU, Ki-67 expression, and NACR was 0.91 for metastatic risk. NACR and metastatic risk were predicted with high accuracy using the nonuniformity in PET image texture.

Conclusion: Combining PET image texture nonuniformity with Ki-67 expression and clinical data can enhance the accuracy of metastasis prediction in osteosarcoma. This multimodal approach may support metastasis risk prediction in osteosarcoma and aid in personalized treatment planning.

TITLE: Evaluation of MRI post-processing methods combined with PET in detecting focal cortical dysplasia lesions for patients with MRI-negative epilepsy

AUTHORS: Zhe Qian, Jiuluan Lin, Rifeng Jiang, Stéphane Jean, Yihai Dai, Donghuo Deng, Panashe Tevin Tagu, Lin Shi, Shiwei Song

JOURNAL: Seizure

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Objective: Accurate detection of focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays a pivotal role in the preoperative assessment of epilepsy. The integration of multimodal imaging has demonstrated substantial value in both diagnosing FCD and devising effective surgical strategies. This study aimed to enhance MRI post-processing by incorporating positron emission tomography (PET) analysis. We sought to compare the diagnostic efficacy of diverse image post-processing methodologies in patients presenting MRI-negative FCD.

Methods: In this retrospective investigation, we assembled a cohort of patients with negative preoperative MRI results. T1-weighted volumetric sequences were subjected to morphometric analysis program (MAP) and composite parametric map (CPM) post-processing techniques. We independently co-registered images derived from various methods with PET scans. The alignment was subsequently evaluated, and its correlation was correlated with postoperative seizure outcomes.

Results: A total of 41 patients were enrolled in the study. In the PET-MAP(p = 0.0189) and PET-CPM(p = 0.00041) groups, compared with the non-overlap group, the overlap group significantly associated with better postoperative outcomes. In PET(p = 0.234), CPM(p = 0.686) and MAP(p = 0.672), there is no statistical significance between overlap and seizure-free outcomes. The sensitivity of using the CPM alone outperformed the MAP (0.65 vs 0.46). The use of PET-CPM demonstrated superior sensitivity (0.96), positive predictive value (0.83), and negative predictive value (0.91), whereas the MAP displayed superior specificity (0.71).

Conclusions: Our findings suggested a superiority in sensitivity of CPM in detecting potential FCD lesions compared to MAP, especially when it is used in combination with PET for diagnosis of MRI-negative epilepsy patients. Moreover, we confirmed the superiority of synergizing metabolic imaging (PET) with quantitative maps derived from structural imaging (MAP or CPM) to enhance the identification of subtle epileptogenic zones (EZs). This study serves to illuminate the potential of integrated multimodal techniques in advancing our capability to pinpoint elusive pathological features in epilepsy cases.

TITLE: Quantitative evaluation of single-photon emission computed tomography findings in lower extremity possible without computed tomography-based attenuation correction

AUTHORS: Tatsuya Tsuchitani, Kazuhiro Kitajima, Yoshiyuki Takahashi, Noriko Kotoura

JOURNAL: Nuclear medicine communications

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Objective: For performing accurate quantitative analysis of single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/computed tomography (CT) images, CT-based attenuation correction (CTAC) is considered to be necessary. However, the effect on quantitative values for an examined area close to the body surface, such as in the lower extremity, has yet to be elucidated. We performed the present investigation to determine the possibility of quantitative evaluation using a SPECT standalone device without CT.

Methods: Validation was performed using clinical data of patients who underwent a lower extremity SPECT/CT examination, with grouping based on presence or absence of CTAC, scatter correction and resolution recovery. Using a reference group in which all types of correction were applied, standardized uptake values (SUVs), including maximum (SUVmax) and peak (SUVpeak), were examined in each group and compared.

Results: As compared to the reference group, the difference in quantitative values became smaller in the order of the applied scatter correction and resolution recovery, applied resolution recovery, applied scatter correction, and neither scatter correction or resolution recovery applied groups, with no significant difference between the reference group and that with neither scatter correction or resolution recovery applied. A similar tendency was seen for both SUVmax and SUVpeak.

Conclusions: In bone SPECT quantitative examinations of the lower extremity, quantitative evaluation without CTAC is possible without the use of scatter correction or resolution recovery. Thus, quantitative evaluation can be performed with use of a standalone SPECT device without CT.

TITLE: Full-count PET recovery from low-count image using a dilated convolutional neural network

AUTHORS: Karl Spuhler, Mario Serrano-Sosa, Renee Cattell, Christine DeLorenzo, Chuan Huang

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Positron emission tomography (PET) is an essential technique in many clinical applications that allows for quantitative imaging at the molecular level. This study aims to develop a denoising method using a novel dilated convolutional neural network (CNN) to recover full-count images from low-count images.

Methods: We adopted similar hierarchical structures as the conventional U-Net and incorporated dilated kernels in each convolution to allow the network to observe larger, more robust features within the image without the requirement of downsampling and upsampling internal representations. Our dNet was trained alongside a U-Net for comparison. Both models were evaluated using a leave-one-out cross-validation procedure on a dataset of 35 subjects (~3500 slabs), which were obtained from an ongoing18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) study. Low-count PET data (10% count) were generated by randomly selecting one-tenth of all events in the associated listmode file. Analysis was done on the static image from the last 10 minutes of emission data. Both low-count PET and full-count PET were reconstructed using ordered subset expectation maximization (OSEM). Objective image quality metrics, including mean absolute percent error (MAPE), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), and structural similarity index metric (SSIM), were used to analyze the deep learning methods. Both deep learning methods were further compared to a traditional Gaussian filtering method. Further, region of interest (ROI) quantitative analysis was also used to compare U-Net and dNet architectures.

Results: Both the U-Net and our proposed network were successfully trained to synthesize full-count PET images from the generated low-count PET images. Compared to low-count PET and Gaussian filtering, both deep learning methods improved MAPE, PSNR, and SSIM. Our dNet also systematically outperformed U-Net on all three metrics (MAPE: 4.99 ± 0.68 vs 5.31 ± 0.76, P < 0.01; PSNR: 31.55 ± 1.31 dB vs 31.05 ± 1.39, P < 0.01; SSIM: 0.9513 ± 0.0154 vs 0.9447 ± 0.0178, P < 0.01). ROI quantification showed greater quantitative improvements using dNet over U-Net.

Conclusion: This study proposed a novel approach of using dilated convolutions for recovering full-count PET images from low-count PET images.

Purpose: To develop a predictive model for identifying the higher-risk growth pattern of invasive lung adenocarcinoma using multiphase multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) and 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET radiomics.

Methods: A total of 203 patients with confirmed invasive lung adenocarcinoma between January 2018 and December 2021 were enrolled and randomly divided into training ( n = 143) and testing sets ( n = 60). Patients were classified into two groups according to the predominant growth pattern (lower-risk group: lepidic/acinar; higher-risk group: papillary/solid/micropapillary). Preoperative multiphase MDCT and 18 F-FDG PET images were evaluated. The Artificial Intelligence Kit software was used to extract radiomic features. Five predictive models [arterial phase, venous phase, and plain scan (AVP), PET, AVP-PET, clinical, and radiomic-clinical (Rad-Clin) combined model] were developed. The models' performance was assessed using receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves and compared using the DeLong test.

Results: Among the radiomics models (AVP, PET, and AVP-PET), the AVP-PET model [area under ROC curve (AUC) = 0.888] outperformed the PET model (AUC = 0.814; P = 0.015) in predicting the higher-risk growth patterns. The combined Rad-Clin model (AUC = 0.923), which integrates AVP-PET radiomics and five independent clinical predictors (gender, spiculation, long-axis diameter, maximum standardized uptake value, and average standardized uptake value), exhibited superior performance in predicting the higher-risk growth pattern compared with radiomic models ( P = 0.043, vs. AVP-PET; P = 0.016, vs. AVP; P = 0.002, vs. PET) or the clinical model alone (constructing based on five clinical predictors; AUC = 0.793; P < 0.001).

Conclusion: The combined Rad-Clin model can predict the higher-risk growth patterns of invasive adenocarcinoma (IAC). This approach could help determine individual therapeutic strategies for IAC patients by distinguishing predominant growth patterns with high risk.

TITLE: Translating amyloid PET of different radiotracers by a deep generative model for interchangeability

AUTHORS: Seung Kwan Kang, Hongyoon Choi, Jae Sung Lee, Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative

JOURNAL: NeuroImage

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
It is challenging to compare amyloid PET images obtained with different radiotracers. Here, we introduce a new approach to improve the interchangeability of amyloid PET acquired with different radiotracers through image-level translation. Deep generative networks were developed using unpaired PET datasets, consisting of 203 [11C]PIB and 850 [18F]florbetapir brain PET images. Using 15 paired PET datasets, the standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) values obtained from pseudo-PIB or pseudo-florbetapir PET images translated using the generative networks was compared to those obtained from the original images. The generated amyloid PET images showed similar distribution patterns with original amyloid PET of different radiotracers. The SUVR obtained from the original [18F]florbetapir PET was lower than those obtained from the original [11C]PIB PET. The translated amyloid PET images reduced the difference in SUVR. The SUVR obtained from the pseudo-PIB PET images generated from [18F]florbetapir PET showed a good agreement with those of the original PIB PET (ICC = 0.87 for global SUVR). The SUVR obtained from the pseudo-florbetapir PET also showed a good agreement with those of the original [18F]florbetapir PET (ICC = 0.85 for global SUVR). The ICC values between the original and generated PET images were higher than those between original [11C]PIB and [18F]florbetapir images (ICC = 0.65 for global SUVR). Our approach provides the image-level translation of amyloid PET images obtained using different radiotracers. It may facilitate the clinical studies designed with variable amyloid PET images due to long-term clinical follow-up as well as multicenter trials by enabling the translation of different types of amyloid PET.

TITLE: Parametric net influx rate imaging of 68Ga-DOTATATE in patients with neuroendocrine tumors: assessment of lesion detectability

AUTHORS: Hongyan Yin, Guobing Liu, Wujian Mao, Jing Lv, Haojun Yu, Dengfeng Cheng, Liang Cai, Hongcheng Shi

JOURNAL: Annals of nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Objectives: There has been developed a clinical dynamic total-body68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT imaging protocol that allows quantitative imaging of net influx rate (Ki). Using qualitative and quantitative analyses of clinical studies, this retrospective study aims to assess whether parametric Kiimages improve lesion detectability.

Methods: Using a 194-cm axial field-of-view PET/CT scanner, 52 patients with neuroendocrine tumors underwent a 60-min dynamic total-body68Ga-DOTATATE scan. Parametric Kiimages and static standardized uptake value (SUV) images were generated. In addition to visual inspection of both sets of images, a quantitative analysis of 249 individual lesions was conducted using the target-to-background (TBR) metric.

Results: There were 52 patients who underwent dynamic total-body68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT scans. A total of 249 lesions were evaluated, of which 66 lesions were biopsy-proven and 183 lesions were unproven. Kiimages produced two fewer false positives than the SUV images. Overall, our results from 66 proven NET lesions suggested similar sensitivity (98.5%) but improved accuracy (from 95.6 to 97.1%) and potentially enhanced specificity with Kiover SUV imaging. Besides, there was no difference in the number of pathological lesions identified visually in both images. However, KiTBR was significantly higher than SUV TBR quantitatively (P < 0.001).

Conclusions: Patlak Kiimaging provides nuclear physicians with a PET image with higher tumor contrast which may enhance confidence in diagnosis with possibly reduced false positive results, albeit an equivalent detectability, compared to static SUV image.

TITLE: RadShap: An Explanation Tool for Highlighting the Contributions of Multiple Regions of Interest to the Prediction of Radiomic Models

AUTHORS: Nicolas Captier, Fanny Orlhac, Narinée Hovhannisyan-Baghdasarian, Marie Luporsi, Nicolas Girard, Irène Buvat

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Explaining the decisions made by a radiomic model is of significant interest, as it can provide valuable insights into the information learned by complex models and foster trust in well-performing ones, thereby facilitating their clinical adoption. Promising radiomic approaches that aggregate information from multiple regions within an image currently lack suitable explanation tools that could identify the regions that most significantly influence their decisions. Here we present a model- and modality-agnostic tool (RadShap, https://github.com/ncaptier/radshap), based on Shapley values, that explains the predictions of multiregion radiomic models by highlighting the contribution of each individual region.Methods:The explanation tool leverages Shapley values to distribute the aggregative radiomic model's output among all the regions of interest of an image, highlighting their individual contribution. RadShap was validated using a retrospective cohort of 130 patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer undergoing first-line immunotherapy. Their baseline PET scans were used to build 1,000 synthetic tasks to evaluate the degree of alignment between the tool's explanations and our data generation process. RadShap's potential was then illustrated through 2 real case studies by aggregating information from all segmented tumors: the prediction of the progression-free survival of the non-small cell lung cancer patients and the classification of the histologic tumor subtype.Results:RadShap demonstrated strong alignment with the ground truth, with a median frequency of 94% for consistently explained predictions in the synthetic tasks. In both real-case studies, the aggregative models yielded superior performance to the single-lesion models (average [±SD] time-dependent area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.66 ± 0.02 for the aggregative survival model vs. 0.55 ± 0.04 for the primary tumor survival model). The tool's explanations provided relevant insights into the behavior of the aggregative models, highlighting that for the classification of the histologic subtype, the aggregative model used information beyond the biopsy site to correctly classify patients who were initially misclassified by a model focusing only on the biopsied tumor.Conclusion:RadShap aligned with ground truth explanations and provided valuable insights into radiomic models' behaviors. It is implemented as a user-friendly Python package with documentation and tutorials, facilitating its smooth integration into radiomic pipelines.

TITLE: EFNet: evidence fusion network for tumor segmentation from PET-CT volumes

AUTHORS: Zhaoshuo Diao, Huiyan Jiang, Xian-Hua Han, Yu-Dong Yao, Tianyu Shi

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Precise delineation of target tumor from positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) is a key step in clinical practice and radiation therapy. PET-CT co-segmentation actually uses the complementary information of two modalities to reduce the uncertainty of single-modal segmentation, so as to obtain more accurate segmentation results. At present, the PET-CT segmentation methods based on fully convolutional neural network (FCN) mainly adopt image fusion and feature fusion. The current fusion strategies do not consider the uncertainty of multi-modal segmentation and complex feature fusion consumes more computing resources, especially when dealing with 3D volumes. In this work, we analyze the PET-CT co-segmentation from the perspective of uncertainty, and propose evidence fusion network (EFNet). The network respectively outputs PET result and CT result containing uncertainty by proposed evidence loss, which are used as PET evidence and CT evidence. Then we use evidence fusion to reduce uncertainty of single-modal evidence. The final segmentation result is obtained based on evidence fusion of PET evidence and CT evidence. EFNet uses the basic 3D U-Net as backbone and only uses simple unidirectional feature fusion. In addition, EFNet can separately train and predict PET evidence and CT evidence, without the need for parallel training of two branch networks. We do experiments on the soft-tissue-sarcomas and lymphoma datasets. Compared with 3D U-Net, our proposed method improves the Dice by 8% and 5% respectively. Compared with the complex feature fusion method, our proposed method improves the Dice by 7% and 2% respectively. Our results show that in PET-CT segmentation methods based on FCN, by outputting uncertainty evidence and evidence fusion, the network can be simplified and the segmentation results can be improved.

TITLE: Voxel-based partial volume correction of PET images via subtle MRI guided non-local means regularization

AUTHORS: Yuanyuan Gao, Yansong Zhu, Murat Bilgel, Saeed Ashrafinia, Lijun Lu, Arman Rahmim

JOURNAL: Physica medica : PM : an international journal devoted to the applications of physics to medicine and biology : official journal of the Italian Association of Biomedical Physics (AIFB)

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Positron emission tomography (PET) images tend to be significantly degraded by the partial volume effect (PVE) resulting from the limited spatial resolution of the reconstructed images. Our purpose is to propose a partial volume correction (PVC) method to tackle this issue.

Methods: In the present work, we explore a voxel-based PVC method under the least squares framework (LS) employing anatomical non-local means (NLMA) regularization. The well-known non-local means (NLM) filter utilizes the high degree of information redundancy that typically exists in images, and is typically used to directly reduce image noise by replacing each voxel intensity with a weighted average of its non-local neighbors. Here we explore NLM as a regularization term within iterative-deconvolution model to perform PVC. Further, an anatomical-guided version of NLM was proposed that incorporates MRI information into NLM to improve resolution and suppress image noise. The proposed approach makes subtle usage of the accompanying MRI information to define a more appropriate search space within the prior model. To optimize the regularized LS objective function, we used the Gauss-Seidel (GS) algorithm with the one-step-late (OSL) technique.

Results: After the import of NLMA, the visual and quality results are all improved. With a visual check, we notice that NLMA reduce the noise compared to other PVC methods. This is also validated in bias-noise curve compared to non-MRI-guided PVC framework. We can see NLMA gives better bias-noise trade-off compared to other PVC methods.

Conclusions: Our efforts were evaluated in the base of amyloid brain PET imaging using the BrainWeb phantom and in vivo human data. We also compared our method with other PVC methods. Overall, we demonstrated the value of introducing subtle MRI-guidance in the regularization process, the proposed NLMA method resulting in promising visual as well as quantitative performance improvements.

JOURNAL: Computers in biology and medicine

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Background: The Choroid Plexus (ChP) plays a vital role in brain homeostasis, serving as part of the Blood-Cerebrospinal Fluid Barrier, contributing to brain clearance pathways and being the main source of cerebrospinal fluid. Since the involvement of ChP in neurological and psychiatric disorders is not entirely established and currently under investigation, accurate and reproducible segmentation of this brain structure on large cohorts remains challenging. This paper presents ASCHOPLEX, a deep-learning tool for the automated segmentation of human ChP from structural MRI data that integrates existing software architectures like 3D UNet, UNETR, and DynUNet to deliver accurate ChP volume estimates.

Methods: Here we trained ASCHOPLEX on 128 T1-w MRI images comprising both controls and patients with Multiple Sclerosis. ASCHOPLEX's performances were evaluated using traditional segmentation metrics; manual segmentation by experts served as ground truth. To overcome the generalizability problem that affects data-driven approaches, an additional fine-tuning procedure (ASCHOPLEXtune) was implemented on 77 T1-w PET/MRI images of both controls and depressed patients.

Results: ASCHOPLEX showed superior performance compared to commonly used methods like FreeSurfer and Gaussian Mixture Model both in terms of Dice Coefficient (ASCHOPLEX 0.80, ASCHOPLEXtune0.78) and estimated ChP volume error (ASCHOPLEX 9.22%, ASCHOPLEXtune9.23%).

Conclusion: These results highlight the high accuracy, reliability, and reproducibility of ASCHOPLEX ChP segmentations.

TITLE: Comparison of consistency in centiloid scale among different analytical methods in amyloid PET: the CapAIBL, VIZCalc, and Amyquant methods

AUTHORS: Cong Shang, Keita Sakurai, Takashi Nihashi, Yutaka Arahata, Akinori Takeda, Kazunari Ishii, Kenji Ishii, Hiroshi Matsuda, Kengo Ito, Takashi Kato, Hiroshi Toyama, Akinori Nakamura, BATON Study Group

JOURNAL: Annals of nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Objective: The Centiloid (CL) scale is a standardized measure for quantifying amyloid deposition in amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. We aimed to assess the agreement among 3 CL calculation methods: CapAIBL, VIZCalc, and Amyquant.

Methods: This study included 192 participants (mean age: 71.5 years, range: 50-87 years), comprising 55 with Alzheimer's disease, 65 with mild cognitive impairment, 13 with non-Alzheimer's dementia, and 59 cognitively normal participants. All the participants were assessed using the three CL calculation methods. Spearman's rank correlation, linear regression, Friedman tests, Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, and Bland-Altman analysis were employed to assess data correlations, linear associations, method differences, and systematic bias, respectively.

Results: Strong correlations (rho = 0.99, p < .001) were observed among the CL values calculated using the three methods. Scatter plots and regression lines visually confirmed these strong correlations and met the validation criteria. Despite the robust correlations, a significant difference in CL value between CapAIBL and Amyquant was observed (36.1 ± 39.7 vs. 34.9 ± 39.4; p < .001). In contrast, no significant differences were found between CapAIBL and VIZCalc or between VIZCalc and Amyquant. The Bland-Altman analysis showed no observable systematic bias between the methods.

Conclusions: The study demonstrated strong agreement among the three methods for calculating CL values. Despite minor variations in the absolute values of the Centiloid scores obtained using these methods, the overall agreement suggests that they are interchangeable.

TITLE: Evaluation of Varian's SmartAdapt for clinical use in radiation therapy for patients with thoracic lesions

AUTHORS: Jason Vickress, Maria Alejandra Rangel Baltazar, Hossein Afsharpour

JOURNAL: Journal of applied clinical medical physics

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Introduction: Deformable image registration (DIR) is a required tool in any adaptive radiotherapy program to help account for anatomical changes that occur during a multifraction treatment. SmartAdapt is a DIR tool from Varian incorporated within the eclipse treatment planning system, that can be used for contour propagation and transfer of PET, MRI, or computed tomography (CT) data. The purpose of this work is to evaluate the registration and contour propagation accuracy of SmartAdapt for thoracic CT studies using the guidelines from AAPM TG 132.

Methods: To evaluate the registration accuracy of SmartAdapt the mean target registration error (TRE) was measured for ten landmarked 4DCT images from the https://www.dir-labs.com/ which included 300 landmarks matching the inspiration and expiration phase images. To further characterize the registration accuracy, the magnitude of deformation for each 4DCT was measured and compared against the mean TRE for each study. Contour propagation accuracy was evaluated using 22 randomly selected lung cancer cases from our center where there was either a replan, or the patient was treated for a new lesion within the lung. Contours evaluated included the right and left lung, esophagus, spinal canal, heart and the GTV and the results were quantified using the DICE similarity coefficient.

Results: The mean TRE from all ten cases was 1.89 mm, the maximum mean TRE per case was 3.8 mm from case #8, which also had the most landmark pairs with displacements >2 cm. For contour propagation accuracy, the DICE coefficient results for left lung, right lung, heart, esophagus, and spinal canal were 0.93, 0.94, 0.90, 0.61, and 0.82 respectively.

Conclusion: The results from our study demonstrate that for thoracic images SmartAdapt in most cases will be accurate to below 2 mm in registration error unless there is deformation greater than 2 cm.

TITLE: Impact of 18F-FDG PET Intensity Normalization on Radiomic Features of Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinomas and Machine Learning-Generated Biomarkers

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
We aimed to investigate the effects of18F-FDG PET voxel intensity normalization on radiomic features of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) and machine learning-generated radiomic biomarkers.Methods:We extracted 1,03718F-FDG PET radiomic features quantifying the shape, intensity, and texture of 430 OPSCC primary tumors. The reproducibility of individual features across 3 intensity-normalized images (body-weight SUV, reference tissue activity ratio to lentiform nucleus of brain and cerebellum) and the raw PET data was assessed using an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). We investigated the effects of intensity normalization on the features' utility in predicting the human papillomavirus (HPV) status of OPSCCs in univariate logistic regression, receiver-operating-characteristic analysis, and extreme-gradient-boosting (XGBoost) machine-learning classifiers.Results:Of 1,037 features, a high (ICC ≥ 0.90), medium (0.90 > ICC ≥ 0.75), and low (ICC < 0.75) degree of reproducibility across normalization methods was attained in 356 (34.3%), 608 (58.6%), and 73 (7%) features, respectively. In univariate analysis, features from the PET normalized to the lentiform nucleus had the strongest association with HPV status, with 865 of 1,037 (83.4%) significant features after multiple testing corrections and a median area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.65 (interquartile range, 0.62-0.68). Similar tendencies were observed in XGBoost models, with the lentiform nucleus-normalized model achieving the numerically highest average AUC of 0.72 (SD, 0.07) in the cross validation within the training cohort. The model generalized well to the validation cohorts, attaining an AUC of 0.73 (95% CI, 0.60-0.85) in independent validation and 0.76 (95% CI, 0.58-0.95) in external validation. The AUCs of the XGBoost models were not significantly different.Conclusion:Only one third of the features demonstrated a high degree of reproducibility across intensity-normalization techniques, making uniform normalization a prerequisite for interindividual comparability of radiomic markers. The choice of normalization technique may affect the radiomic features' predictive value with respect to HPV. Our results show trends that normalization to the lentiform nucleus may improve model performance, although more evidence is needed to draw a firm conclusion.

TITLE: An international survey on the clinical use of rigid and deformable image registration in radiotherapy

AUTHORS: Johnson Yuen, Jeffrey Barber, Anna Ralston, Alison Gray, Amy Walker, Nicholas Hardcastle, Laurel Schmidt, Kristie Harrison, Joel Poder, Jonathan R Sykes, Michael G Jameson

JOURNAL: Journal of applied clinical medical physics

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Objectives: Rigid image registration (RIR) and deformable image registration (DIR) are widely used in radiotherapy. This project aims to capture current international approaches to image registration.

Methods: A survey was designed to identify variations in use, resources, implementation, and decision-making criteria for clinical image registration. This was distributed to radiotherapy centers internationally in 2018.

Results: There were 57 responses internationally, from the Americas (46%), Australia/New Zealand (32%), Europe (12%), and Asia (10%). Rigid image registration and DIR were used clinically for computed tomography (CT)-CT registration (96% and 51%, respectively), followed by CT-PET (81% and 47%), CT-CBCT (84% and 19%), CT-MR (93% and 19%), MR-MR (49% and 5%), and CT-US (9% and 0%). Respondent centers performed DIR using dedicated software (75%) and treatment planning systems (29%), with 84% having some form of DIR software. Centers have clinically implemented DIR for atlas-based segmentation (47%), multi-modality treatment planning (65%), and dose deformation (63%). The clinical use of DIR for multi-modality treatment planning and accounting for retreatments was considered to have the highest benefit-to-risk ratio (69% and 67%, respectively).

Conclusions: This survey data provides useful insights on where, when, and how image registration has been implemented in radiotherapy centers around the world. DIR is mainly in clinical use for CT-CT (51%) and CT-PET (47%) for the head and neck (43-57% over all use cases) region. The highest benefit-risk ratio for clinical use of DIR was for multi-modality treatment planning and accounting for retreatments, which also had higher clinical use than for adaptive radiotherapy and atlas-based segmentation.

TITLE: Simulation and one-ring prototyping of 1 mm-rod-resolution hemispherical brain PET with TOF-DOI detectors

AUTHORS: Kurumi Narita, Go Akamatsu, Eiji Yoshida, Hideaki Tashima, Yuma Iwao, Miwako Takahashi, Taiga Yamaya

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Objective.Brain positron emission tomography (PET) imaging plays crucial roles in research and diagnosis of various brain diseases. To achieve high spatial resolution and high sensitivity, we proposed a hemispherical geometry which offers higher sensitivity with fewer detectors than a conventional cylindrical geometry. Our developed hemispherical brain PET system, Vrain, has indeed achieved a rod resolution of 2.2 mm with a 229 ps time-of-flight (TOF) resolution. To further improve the spatial resolution, we will use TOF and depth-of-interaction (DOI) detectors with our original crosshair light-sharing (CLS) configuration. This study aimed at estimating the performance of the hemispherical brain PET with TOF-DOI detectors and at developing a one-ring PET prototype with 1.6 mm scintillator pitch CLS-based TOF-DOI detectors.Approach.The sensitivity, rod resolution, and image quality of the TOF-DOI hemispherical brain PET (TDHBP-sim) and Vrain (Vrain-sim) were estimated using Geant4 simulation. A one-ring prototype with a 30 cm diameter was developed using the CLS-based TOF-DOI detectors. The energy resolution, TOF timing resolution, rod resolution, and the Hoffman brain phantom image quality of the prototype were evaluated.Main results.In the simulation study, TDHBP-sim achieved 1.4 times better sensitivity than Vrain-sim. TDHBP-sim visualized 1.0 mm rods and gyri and sulci structures in the brain phantom. In the one-ring experiment, the energy resolution was 11.6% at 511 keV, the TOF timing resolution was 294.6 ps, and 1.0 mm rods were resolved at the central 10 cm-diameter field-of-view. The 0.8 mm-thick radioactivity distribution could be identified in the Hoffman phantom.Significance.The study findings suggested that a hemispherical brain PET with 1.6 mm scintillator pitch TOF-DOI detectors should offer excellent performance including 1 mm rod resolution.

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Background: Amino-acid (AA) PET has recently been endorsed by the ESTRO-EANO guidelines for RT-planning in glioblastomas, with recommended lesion-to-brain-ratio thresholds (1.6-1.8) derived from a biopsy-controlled FET-PET study. We aimed to compare target definition at [18F]DOPA-PET between the ESTRO-EANO thresholds and other biological-tumor-volume (BTV) thresholds (derived from the striatum) typically used in [18F]DOPA-PET.

Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted on glioma patients scanned with [18F]DOPA-PET/CT at our center between April 2021 and January 2024. 3D BTV was semi-automatically computed using a dedicated workstation (Philips HealthCare) with four thresholds: 1.6xSUV<inf>mean</inf> of background, 1.8xSUV<inf>mean</inf> of background, SUV<inf>mean</inf> and SUV<inf>max</inf> of the contralateral striatum. The delineation accuracy of different thresholds was visually evaluated and a t-test was used to compare the different VOIs volumes (0.05 significance-level).

Results: 50 patients were included (36 previously received surgery). Volume definition based on the striatum SUV<inf>max</inf> was significantly smaller compared to other thresholds (2.1 cm3), resulting in inaccurate VOIs at visual inspection in 21/50 patients. No significant differences were highlighted in BTV defined based on 1.6 or 1.8xSUV<inf>mean</inf> of background (15.7 vs. 12.7 cm3; VOIs accurate in 49/50 and 46/50 patients, respectively). BTV based on striatum SUV<inf>mean</inf> was significantly smaller compared to the 1.6xSUV<inf>mean</inf> threshold only in surgically-treated patients (P=0.04), while no significant differences were highlighted compared to the 1.8xSUV<inf>mean</inf> threshold regardless of the patients' group.

Conclusions: The ESTRO-EANO FET-PET thresholds proved to be interchangeable in patients scanned with [18F]DOPA-PET, while the use of a threshold based on the contralateral-striatum SUV<inf>mean</inf> provided partially overlapping results prompting further investigation.

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Sequential PET/CT studies oncology patients can undergo during their treatment follow-up course is limited by radiation dosage. We propose an artificial intelligence (AI) tool to produce attenuation-corrected PET (AC-PET) images from non-attenuation-corrected PET (NAC-PET) images to reduce need for low-dose CT scans.

Methods: A deep learning algorithm based on 2D Pix-2-Pix generative adversarial network (GAN) architecture was developed from paired AC-PET and NAC-PET images.18F-DCFPyL PSMA PET-CT studies from 302 prostate cancer patients, split into training, validation, and testing cohorts (n= 183, 60, 59, respectively). Models were trained with two normalization strategies: Standard Uptake Value (SUV)-based and SUV-Nyul-based. Scan-level performance was evaluated by normalized mean square error (NMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), structural similarity index (SSIM), and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). Lesion-level analysis was performed in regions-of-interest prospectively from nuclear medicine physicians. SUV metrics were evaluated using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), repeatability coefficient (RC), and linear mixed-effects modeling.

Results: Median NMSE, MAE, SSIM, and PSNR were 13.26%, 3.59%, 0.891, and 26.82, respectively, in the independent test cohort. ICC for SUVmaxand SUVmeanwere 0.88 and 0.89, which indicated a high correlation between original and AI-generated quantitative imaging markers. Lesion location, density (Hounsfield units), and lesion uptake were all shown to impact relative error in generated SUV metrics (allp< 0.05).

Conclusion: The Pix-2-Pix GAN model for generating AC-PET demonstrates SUV metrics that highly correlate with original images. AI-generated PET images show clinical potential for reducing the need for CT scans for attenuation correction while preserving quantitative markers and image quality.

TITLE: Few-shot segmentation framework for lung nodules via an optimized active contour model

AUTHORS: Lin Yang, Dan Shao, Zhenxing Huang, Mengxiao Geng, Na Zhang, Long Chen, Xi Wang, Dong Liang, Zhi-Feng Pang, Zhanli Hu

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Background: Accurate segmentation of lung nodules is crucial for the early diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer in clinical practice. However, the similarity between lung nodules and surrounding tissues has made their segmentation a longstanding challenge.

Purpose: Existing deep learning and active contour models each have their limitations. This paper aims to integrate the strengths of both approaches while mitigating their respective shortcomings.

Methods: In this paper, we propose a few-shot segmentation framework that combines a deep neural network with an active contour model. We introduce heat kernel convolutions and high-order total variation into the active contour model and solve the challenging nonsmooth optimization problem using the alternating direction method of multipliers. Additionally, we use the presegmentation results obtained from training a deep neural network on a small sample set as the initial contours for our optimized active contour model, addressing the difficulty of manually setting the initial contours.

Results: We compared our proposed method with state-of-the-art methods for segmentation effectiveness using clinical computed tomography (CT) images acquired from two different hospitals and the publicly available LIDC dataset. The results demonstrate that our proposed method achieved outstanding segmentation performance according to both visual and quantitative indicators.

Conclusion: Our approach utilizes the output of few-shot network training as prior information, avoiding the need to select the initial contour in the active contour model. Additionally, it provides mathematical interpretability to the deep learning, reducing its dependency on the quantity of training samples.

TITLE: Prognostic value of 18F-FDG PET radiomics and sarcopenia in patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma

AUTHORS: Yuxing Song, Ying Tian, Xinyan Lu, Gaoxiang Chen, Xiaozhi Lv

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Background: Oral cancer is one of the most common malignancies in the head and neck region. Approximately 90% of oral cancers are oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC).18F-FDG PET/CT has been used in OSCC patients for its high value in detecting metastatic lymph nodes and distant metastases. PET radiomics and sarcopenia can be measured on the PET and CT components of18F-FDG PET/CT.

Purpose: This study aimed to investigate the prognostic value of radiomics and sarcopenia measured on the PET and CT components of pre-operation18F-FDG PET/CT in OSCC.

Methods: A total of 116 patients eventually enrolled in our study were randomly divided into two cohorts: training cohort (n = 58) and validation cohort (n = 58). The Cox model combined with the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm was applied to construct the radiomics score (Rad_score). The third lumber skeletal muscle index (L3 SMI) was calculated to identify sarcopenia. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to identify the independent prognostic factors. Based on the clinical factors, the clinical model was constructed, and the combined model was developed through the combination of the clinical model and Rad_score. C index, time-dependent C-index curves, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, calibration curves, and decision curve analysis were used to evaluate the performance of prediction models.

Results: Three radiomics features constitute the Rad_score for overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS), respectively. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that Rad_score was an independent prognostic factor, whereas sarcopenia was not. The combined models showed satisfactory performance in both the training cohort (C-index: OS:0.836, PFS:0.776) and the validation cohort (C-index: OS:0.744, PFS:0.712). The combined models were visualized as nomograms. Nomogram scores can realize the risk stratification of OSCC patients. Lower nomogram score is significantly related to the poorer OS (training cohort: p < 0.0001, validation cohort: p < 0.0001, overall cohort: p < 0.0001) and PFS (training cohort: p < 0.0001, validation cohort: p = 0.00017, overall cohort: p < 0.0001).

Conclusions: Rad_score, but not sarcopenia, was an independent prognostic factor for patients with OSCC. The nomograms had a satisfactory performance, which might be helpful for OSCC patients and clinicians in personalized prognostic prediction and treatment decision-making.

TITLE: Quantitation of multiple injection dynamic PET scans: an investigation of the benefits of pooling data from separate scans when mapping kinetics

AUTHORS: Fengyun Gu, Finbarr O'Sullivan, Mark Muzi, David A Mankoff

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Multiple injection dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) scanning is used in the clinical management of certain groups of patients and in medical research. The analysis of these studies can be approached in two ways: (i) separate analysis of data from individual tracer injections, or (ii), concatenate/pool data from separate injections and carry out a combined analysis. The simplicity of separate analysis has some practical appeal but may not be statistically efficient. We use a linear model framework associated with a kinetic mapping scheme to develop a simplified theoretical understanding of separate and combined analysis. The theoretical framework is explored numerically using both 1D and 2D simulation models. These studies are motivated by the breast cancer flow-metabolism mismatch studies involving15O-water (H2O) and18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and repeat15O-H2O injections used in brain activation investigations. Numerical results are found to be substantially in line with the simple theoretical analysis: mean square error characteristics of alternative methods are well described by factors involving the local voxel-level resolution of the imaging data, the relative activities of the individual scans and the number of separate injections involved. While voxel-level resolution has dependence on scan dose, after adjustment for this effect, the impact of a combined analysis is understood in simple terms associated with the linear model used for kinetic mapping. This is true for both data reconstructed by direct filtered backprojection or iterative maximum likelihood. The proposed analysis has potential to be applied to the emerging long axial field-of-view PET scanners.

TITLE: DiSegNet: A deep dilated convolutional encoder-decoder architecture for lymph node segmentation on PET/CT images

AUTHORS: Guoping Xu, Hanqiang Cao, Jayaram K Udupa, Yubing Tong, Drew A Torigian

JOURNAL: Computerized medical imaging and graphics : the official journal of the Computerized Medical Imaging Society

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Automated lymph node (LN) recognition and segmentation from cross-sectional medical images is an important step for the automated diagnostic assessment of patients with cancer. Yet, it is still a difficult task owing to the low contrast of LNs and surrounding soft tissues as well as due to the variation in nodal size and shape. In this paper, we present a novel LN segmentation method based on a newly designed neural network for positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) images.

Methods: This work communicates two problems involved in LN segmentation task. Firstly, an efficient loss function named cosine-sine (CS) is proposed for the voxel class imbalance problem in the convolution network training process. Second, a multi-stage and multi-scale Atrous (Dilated) spatial pyramid pooling sub-module, named MS-ASPP, is introduced to the encoder-decoder architecture (SegNet), which aims to make use of multi-scale information to improve the performance of LN segmentation. The new architecture is named DiSegNet (Dilated SegNet).

Results: Four-fold cross-validation is performed on 63 PET/CT data sets. In each experiment, 10 data sets are selected randomly for testing and the other 53 for training. The results show that we reach an average 77 % Dice similarity coefficient score with CS loss function by trained DiSegNet, compared to a baseline method SegNet by cross-entropy (CE) with 71 % Dice similarity coefficient.

Conclusions: The performance of the proposed DiSegNet with CS loss function suggests its potential clinical value for disease quantification.

TITLE: Monolithic U-shaped crystal design for TOF-DOI detectors: a flat top versus a tapered top

AUTHORS: Miho Kiyokawa, Han Gyu Kang, Taiga Yamaya

JOURNAL: Biomedical physics & engineering express

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
For brain-dedicated positron emission tomography (PET) scanners, depth-of-interaction (DOI) information is essential to achieve uniform spatial resolution across the field-of-view (FOV) by minimizing parallax error. Time-of-flight (TOF) information can enhance the image quality. In this study, we proposed a novel monolithic U-shaped crystal design that had a tapered geometry to achieve good coincidence timing resolution (CTR) and DOI resolution simultaneously. We compared a novel tapered U-shaped crystal design with a conventional flat-top geometry for PET detectors. Each crystal had outer dimensions of 5.85 × 2.75 × 15 mm3, with a 0.2 mm central gap forming physically isolated bottom surfaces (2.85 × 2.75 mm2). The novel U-shape crystal design with a tapered top roof resulted in the best CTR of 201 ± 3 ps, and DOI resolution of 3.1 ± 0.6 mm, which were better than flat top geometry. In the next study, we plan to optimize the crystal surface treatment and reflector to further improve the CTR and DOI resolution.

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
In oncologic PET, the SUV and standardized uptake ratio (SUR) of a viable tumor generally increase during the postinjection period. In contrast, the net influx rate (), which is derived from dynamic PET data, should remain relatively constant. Uptake-time-corrected SUV (cSUV) and SUR (cSUR) have been proposed as uptake-time-independent, static alternatives toOur primary aim was to quantify the intrascan repeatability of, SUV, cSUV, SUR, and cSUR among malignant lesions on PET/CT. An exploratory aim was to assess the ability of cSUR to estimateMethods:This prospective, single-center study enrolled adults undergoing standard-of-care oncologic PET/CT. SUV andimages were reconstructed from dynamic PET data obtained before (∼35-50 min after injection) and after (∼75-90 min after injection) standard-of-care imaging. Tumors were manually segmented. Quantitative metrics were extracted. cSUVs and cSURs were calculated for a 60-min postinjection reference uptake time. The magnitude of the intrascan test-retest percent change (test-retest |%Δ|) was calculated. Coefficients of determination (R2) and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were also computed. Differences between metrics were assessed via the Wilcoxon signed-rank test (α, 0.05).Results:This study enrolled 78 subjects; 41 subjects (mean age, 63.8 y; 24 men) with 116 lesions were analyzed. For both tracers, SUVmaxand maximum SUR (SURmax) had large early-to-late increases (i.e., poor intrascan repeatability). Among [18F]FDG-avid lesions (n= 93), there were no differences in intrascan repeatability (median test-retest |%Δ|; ICC) between the maximum(,max) (13%; 0.97) and either the maximum cSUV (cSUVmax) (12%,P= 0.90; 0.96) or the maximum cSUR (cSURmax) (13%,P= 0.67; 0.94). For DOTATATE-avid lesions (n= 23), there were no differences in intrascan repeatability between the,max(11%; 0.98) and either the cSUVmax(13%,P= 0.41; 0.98) or the cSURmax(11%,P= 0.08; 0.94). The SUVmax, cSUVmax, SURmax, and cSURmaxwere all strongly correlated with the,maxfor both [18F]FDG (R2, 0.81-0.92) and DOTATATE (R2, 0.88-0.96), but the cSURmaxprovided the best agreement with the,maxacross early-to-late time points for [18F]FDG (ICC, 0.69-0.75) and DOTATATE (ICC, 0.90-0.91).Conclusion:,max, cSUVmax, and cSURmaxhad low uptake time dependence compared with SUVmaxand SURmaxThe,maxcan be predicted from cSURmax.

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Total metabolic tumor volume (TMTV) segmentation has significant value enabling quantitative imaging biomarkers for lymphoma management. In this work, we tackle the challenging task of automated tumor delineation in lymphoma from PET/CT scans using a cascaded approach.

Methods: Our study included 1418 2-[18F]FDG PET/CT scans from four different centers. The dataset was divided into 900 scans for development/validation/testing phases and 518 for multi-center external testing. The former consisted of 450 lymphoma, lung cancer, and melanoma scans, along with 450 negative scans, while the latter consisted of lymphoma patients from different centers with diffuse large B cell, primary mediastinal large B cell, and classic Hodgkin lymphoma cases. Our approach involves resampling PET/CT images into different voxel sizes in the first step, followed by training multi-resolution 3D U-Nets on each resampled dataset using a fivefold cross-validation scheme. The models trained on different data splits were ensemble. After applying soft voting to the predicted masks, in the second step, we input the probability-averaged predictions, along with the input imaging data, into another 3D U-Net. Models were trained with semi-supervised loss. We additionally considered the effectiveness of using test time augmentation (TTA) to improve the segmentation performance after training. In addition to quantitative analysis including Dice score (DSC) and TMTV comparisons, the qualitative evaluation was also conducted by nuclear medicine physicians.

Results: Our cascaded soft-voting guided approach resulted in performance with an average DSC of 0.68 ± 0.12 for the internal test data from developmental dataset, and an average DSC of 0.66 ± 0.18 on the multi-site external data (n = 518), significantly outperforming (p < 0.001) state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches including nnU-Net and SWIN UNETR. While TTA yielded enhanced performance gains for some of the comparator methods, its impact on our cascaded approach was found to be negligible (DSC: 0.66 ± 0.16). Our approach reliably quantified TMTV, with a correlation of 0.89 with the ground truth (p < 0.001). Furthermore, in terms of visual assessment, concordance between quantitative evaluations and clinician feedback was observed in the majority of cases. The average relative error (ARE) and the absolute error (AE) in TMTV prediction on external multi-centric dataset were ARE = 0.43 ± 0.54 and AE = 157.32 ± 378.12 (mL) for all the external test data (n = 518), and ARE = 0.30 ± 0.22 and AE = 82.05 ± 99.78 (mL) when the 10% outliers (n = 53) were excluded.

Conclusion: TMTV-Net demonstrates strong performance and generalizability in TMTV segmentation across multi-site external datasets, encompassing various lymphoma subtypes. A negligible reduction of 2% in overall performance during testing on external data highlights robust model generalizability across different centers and cancer types, likely attributable to its training with resampled inputs. Our model is publicly available, allowing easy multi-site evaluation and generalizability analysis on datasets from different institutions.

TITLE: Radiomics and deep learning in lung cancer

AUTHORS: Michele Avanzo, Joseph Stancanello, Giovanni Pirrone, Giovanna Sartor

JOURNAL: Strahlentherapie und Onkologie : Organ der Deutschen Rontgengesellschaft ... [et al]

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Lung malignancies have been extensively characterized through radiomics and deep learning. By providing a three-dimensional characterization of the lesion, models based on radiomic features from computed tomography (CT) and positron-emission tomography (PET) have been developed to detect nodules, distinguish malignant from benign lesions, characterize their histology, stage, and genotype. Deep learning models have been applied to automatically segment organs at risk in lung cancer radiotherapy, stratify patients according to the risk for local and distant recurrence, and identify patients candidate for molecular targeted therapy and immunotherapy. Moreover, radiomics has also been applied successfully to predict side effects such as radiation- and immunotherapy-induced pneumonitis and differentiate lung injury from recurrence. Radiomics could also untap the potential for further use of the cone beam CT acquired for treatment image guidance, four-dimensional CT, and dose-volume data from radiotherapy treatment plans. Radiomics is expected to increasingly affect the clinical practice of treatment of lung tumors, optimizing the end-to-end diagnosis-treatment-follow-up chain. The main goal of this article is to provide an update on the current status of lung cancer radiomics.

TITLE: Deep learning based synthetic-CT generation in radiotherapy and PET: A review

AUTHORS: Maria Francesca Spadea, Matteo Maspero, Paolo Zaffino, Joao Seco

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Recently,deep learning (DL)-based methods for the generation of synthetic computed tomography (sCT) have received significant research attention as an alternative to classical ones. We present here a systematic review of these methods by grouping them into three categories, according to their clinical applications: (i) to replace computed tomography in magnetic resonance (MR) based treatment planning, (ii) facilitate cone-beam computed tomography based image-guided adaptive radiotherapy, and (iii) derive attenuation maps for the correction of positron emission tomography. Appropriate database searching was performed on journal articles published between January 2014 and December 2020. The DL methods' key characteristics were extracted from each eligible study, and a comprehensive comparison among network architectures and metrics was reported. A detailed review of each category was given, highlighting essential contributions, identifying specific challenges, and summarizing the achievements. Lastly, the statistics of all the cited works from various aspects were analyzed, revealing the popularity and future trends and the potential of DL-based sCT generation. The current status of DL-based sCT generation was evaluated, assessing the clinical readiness of the presented methods.

TITLE: Populational and individual information based PET image denoising using conditional unsupervised learning

AUTHORS: Jianan Cui, Kuang Gong, Ning Guo, Chenxi Wu, Kyungsang Kim, Huafeng Liu, Quanzheng Li

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Our study aims to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of positron emission tomography (PET) imaging using conditional unsupervised learning. The proposed method does not require low- and high-quality pairs for network training which can be easily applied to existing PET/computed tomography (CT) and PET/magnetic resonance (MR) datasets. This method consists of two steps: populational training and individual fine-tuning. As for populational training, a network was first pre-trained by a group of patients' noisy PET images and the corresponding anatomical prior images from CT or MR. As for individual fine-tuning, a new network with initial parameters inherited from the pre-trained network was fine-tuned by the test patient's noisy PET image and the corresponding anatomical prior image. Only the last few layers were fine-tuned to take advantage of the populational information and the pre-training efforts. Both networks shared the same structure and took the CT or MR images as the network input so that the network output was conditioned on the patient's anatomic prior information. The noisy PET images were used as the training and fine-tuning labels. The proposed method was evaluated on a68Ga-PPRGD2 PET/CT dataset and a18F-FDG PET/MR dataset. For the PET/CT dataset, with the original noisy PET image as the baseline, the proposed method has a significantly higher contrast-to noise ratio (CNR) improvement (71.85% ± 27.05%) than Gaussian (12.66% ± 6.19%,P= 0.002), nonlocal mean method (22.60% ± 13.11%,P= 0.002) and conditional deep image prior method (52.94% ± 21.79%,P= 0.0039). For the PET/MR dataset, compared to Gaussian (18.73% ± 9.98%,P< 0.0001), NLM (26.01% ± 19.40%,P< 0.0001) and CDIP (47.48% ± 25.36%,P< 0.0001), the CNR improvement ratio of the proposed method (58.07% ± 28.45%) is the highest. In addition, the denoised images using both datasets also showed that the proposed method can accurately restore tumor structures while also smoothing out the noise.

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: In this work, we addressed fully automatic determination of tumor functional uptake from positron emission tomography (PET) images without relying on other image modalities or additional prior constraints, in the context of multicenter images with heterogeneous characteristics.

Methods: In cervical cancer, an additional challenge is the location of the tumor uptake near or even stuck to the bladder. PET datasets of 232 patients from five institutions were exploited. To avoid unreliable manual delineations, the ground truth was generated with a semi-automated approach: a volume containing the tumor and excluding the bladder was first manually determined, then a well-validated, semi-automated approach relying on the Fuzzy locally Adaptive Bayesian (FLAB) algorithm was applied to generate the ground truth. Our model built on the U-Net architecture incorporates residual blocks with concurrent spatial squeeze and excitation modules, as well as learnable non-linear downsampling and upsampling blocks. Experiments relied on cross-validation (four institutions for training and validation, and the fifth for testing).

Results: The model achieved good Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) with little variability across institutions (0.80 ± 0.03), with higher recall (0.90 ± 0.05) than precision (0.75 ± 0.05) and improved results over the standard U-Net (DSC 0.77 ± 0.05, recall 0.87 ± 0.02, precision 0.74 ± 0.08). Both vastly outperformed a fixed threshold at 40% of SUVmax (DSC 0.33 ± 0.15, recall 0.52 ± 0.17, precision 0.30 ± 0.16). In all cases, the model could determine the tumor uptake without including the bladder. Neither shape priors nor anatomical information was required to achieve efficient training.

Conclusion: The proposed method could facilitate the deployment of a fully automated radiomics pipeline in such a challenging multicenter context.

TITLE: High-resolution TOF-DOI PET detectors through the implementation of dual-ended readout with SiPM arrays of different pixel sizes on the two ends

AUTHORS: Zheng Liu, Samuel Mungai, Zhonghua Kuang, Ning Ren, Siwei Xie, Qiyu Peng, Crispin Williams, Yongfeng Yang

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Background: An organ-specific Positron emission tomography (PET) scanner can achieve the same sensitivity with much fewer detectors as compared to a whole-body PET scanner, thereby substantially reducing the system cost. It can also achieve much better spatial resolution as compared to a whole-body PET scanner since the photon noncollinearity effect is reduced by using smaller detector ring diameter. Consequently, the development of organ-specific PET scanners with high spatial resolution, high sensitivity, and low cost has been a major focus of international research in PET instrument development for many years.

Purpose: The focus of this work is to develop high-resolution depth encoding PET detectors with high timing resolution and a reduced number of signal processing electronic channels. Consequently, PET scanners tailored for specific organs can be developed with high spatial and timing resolutions, enhanced sensitivity, and affordable cost.

Methods: An 8 × 8 silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) array with a pixel size of 3 × 3 mm2and a multiplexed signal readout circuit is coupled to one end of the lutetium yttrium orthosilicate (LYSO) array with a glass light guide between them to achieve a good crystal identification of small crystals by using only four position-encoding energy signals. A 4 × 4 SiPM array with a pixel size of 6 × 6 mm2and an individual readout circuit is coupled to the other end of the crystal array without a light guide to achieve a good coincidence timing resolution (CTR). The depth of interaction (DOI) of the detector is measured by ratio of the energies measured by the two SiPM arrays and can be used to correct the depth dependency of the timing. The flood histograms, energy resolutions (ERs), DOI resolutions, and CTRs of two detectors utilizing LYSO arrays with different crystal sizes were measured with each of the two SiPM arrays alternately placed at the front of the detectors.

Results: A better flood histogram was obtained by placing the 8 × 8 SiPM array in front of the detector. The depth dependency of timing was larger when the 4 × 4 SiPM array was placed at the front of the detector. A better CTR was obtained by placing the 4 × 4 SiPM array at the back of the detector as compared to placing it at the front of the detector if the depth-dependent timing correction was not performed. If the depth-dependent timing correction was performed, a better CTR can be obtained by placing the 4 × 4 SiPM array at the front of the detector. The first detector using a 12 × 12 LYSO crystal array with a crystal size of 1.95 × 1.95 × 20 mm3provided a flood histogram with all crystals clearly resolved, an ER of 11.7%, a DOI resolution of 2.9 mm, and a CTR of 275 ps with the depth-dependent timing correction. The second detector using a 23 × 23 LYSO crystal array with a crystal size of 0.95 × 0.95 × 20 mm3provided a flood histogram with all but the edge crystals clearly resolved, an ER of 17.6%, a DOI resolution of 2.3 mm, and a CTR of 293 ps with the depth-dependent timing correction.

Conclusions: PET detectors with small crystal cross-sectional sizes, good DOI and timing resolutions and a reduced number of electronics channels were developed. The detectors can be used to develop high performance organ-specific PET scanners.

TITLE: Diagnostic Value of 18F-FDG PET/CT Radiomics in Lymphoma: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis

AUTHORS: Chaoying Liu, Jun Zhao, Heng Zhang, Xinye Ni

JOURNAL: Technology in cancer research & treatment

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
IntroductionVarious machine learning models and features have been proposed for lymphoma diagnosis using18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) PET/CT radiomics. This research aimed to systematically evaluate the diagnostic value of18F-FDG PET/CT radiomics in lymphoma by conducting a meta-analysis.MethodsData from published studies regarding the diagnosis of lymphoma using18F-FDG PET/CT radiomics, from January 2010 to July 2024, were gathered from PubMed, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library. Following their separate searches and screenings of the literature, two researchers extracted data and assessed the caliber of all the included studies. The quality assessment involved the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 (QUADAS-2), the Radiomics Quality Score (RQS), and the METhodological RadiomICs Score (METRICS). The meta-analysis was conducted by using RevMan 5.4.1, R 4.4.0, and Stata 17.0 software. Six meta-regressions were conducted on study performance, considering sample size, image modality, region of interest (ROI) selection, ROI segmentation, radiomics mode, and algorithms.ResultsIn total, 20 studies classified as type 2a or above according to the Transparent Reporting of a Multivariable Prediction Model for Individual Prognosis or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) statement were included for this systematic review and meta-analysis. The studies achieved an average RQS of 13 (ranging from 10 to 17), accounting for 36.1% of the total points. The average METRICS score was 69.3% (ranging from 54.8% to 80.9%). The quality category of the studies is mainly "good". The results of our meta-analysis showed that the pooled sensitivity (SEN), specificity (SPE), positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio and diagnostic odds ratio with 95% confidence interval (CI) were 0.82 (0.78, 0.88), 0.83 (0.76, 0.87), 4.7 (3.4, 6.6), 0.20 (0.15, 0.28) and 23 (13, 42), respectively. The area under the curve of the summary receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.90 (0.87, 0.92). The results of Spearman correlation analysis revealed no threshold effect among the studies (P= .423). Significant heterogeneity was observed among the studies (overall= 83.7%; 95%CI: 76.0, 88.9;P< .01). Meta-regressions indicated that sample size and ROI selection contributed to the heterogeneity in SEN, while algorithms affected the heterogeneity in SPE (P< .05). Deeks' test confirmed there was no significant publication bias in all the included studies. The Fagan nomogram showed an absolute increase of 34% in the post-test probability following a positive test result.ConclusionThe results supported that18F-FDG PET/CT radiomics has high diagnostic value for lymphoma. However, there is high heterogeneity among different studies. In the future, clinical practicality needs to be substantiated by more prospective studies with rigorous adherence to existing guidelines and multicentric validation.

ABSTRACT:
Objective: This study aims to assess the utility of newly developed objective methods for the evaluation of intracranial abnormal amyloid deposition using PET/CT histogram without use of cortical ROI analyses.

Methods: Twenty-five healthy volunteers (HV) and 38 patients with diagnosed or suspected dementia who had undergone18F-FPYBF-2 PET/CT were retrospectively included in this study. Out of them,11C-PiB PET/CT had been also performed in 13 subjects. In addition to the conventional methods, namely visual judgment and quantitative analyses using composed standardized uptake value ratio (comSUVR), the PET images were also evaluated by the following new parameters: the skewness and the mode-to-mean ratio (MMR) obtained from the histogram of the brain parenchyma; Top20%-map highlights the areas with high tracer accumulation occupying 20% volume of the total brain parenchymal on the individual's CT images. We evaluated the utility of the new methods using histogram compared with the visual assessment and comSUVR. The results of these new methods between18F-FPYBF-2 and11C-PiB were also compared in 13 subjects.

Results: In visual analysis, 32, 9, and 22 subjects showed negative, border, and positive results, and composed SUVR in each group were 1.11 ± 0.06, 1.20 ± 0.13, and 1.48 ± 0.18 (p < 0.0001), respectively. Visually positive subjects showed significantly low skewness and high MMR (p < 0.0001), and the Top20%-Map showed the presence or absence of abnormal deposits clearly. In comparison between the two tracers, visual evaluation was all consistent, and the ComSUVR, the skewness, the MMR showed significant good correlation. The Top20%-Maps showed similar pattern.

Conclusions: Our new methods using the histogram of the brain parenchymal accumulation are simple and suitable for clinical practice of amyloid PET, and Top20%-Map on the individual's brain CT can be of great help for the visual assessment.

TITLE: Optimization of scanning time of 18F-FDG whole body PET/CT imaging in obese patients using quadratic dose protocol

AUTHORS: M Musarudin, N H Badrul Fikli, N F Zulkaffli, A Rashid Jusoh, M A Said

JOURNAL: The Medical journal of Malaysia

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Introduction: 18F-FDG imaging of overweight and obese patients is often challenging due to higher scattering and attenuation. Degradation of positron emission tomography (PET) image quality as the body weight increases is best overcome by using the quadratic dose protocol. Previously the implementation of this protocol on a Bismuth Germanium Oxide (BGO) scintillation crystal-based PET/CT system at Institut Kanser Negara (IKN), Malaysia practices using the linear dose protocol (Tmin=2.5 minutes). Hence, this study aims to optimize the Tminof the quadratic dose protocol for18F-FDG PET/CT.

Materials and methods: This study was conducted based on the guideline published by the European Association of Nuclear Medicine (EANM) version 2.0 FDG-PET/CT and conducted in two phases. Firstly, 100 whole-body scan18FFDG PET/CT images were selected for the average coefficient of variation (COV) analysis in the liver region. Second, a NEMA 2012/IEC2008 phantom was used to obtain the relationship between the COVphantomand the scanning time. Finally, the images acquired using the two Tminwere quantitatively compared using contrast recovery coefficient (QH), signal to noise ratio (SNR), and visibility (VH). Independent t-test between each image quality parameter performed with p-value <0.05 considered significant.

Results: The average COV of the liver was 17.7%. Currently, this value was clinically accepted to produce appropriate image quality at IKN. Interpolation at COV=17.7% gave a Tminvalue of 2.9 minutes. Comparisons show that the two Tminyielded equivalent PET/CT image quality (p-value of QH=0.774, SNR=0.780 and VH=0.915).

Conclusion: The optimal Tmindefined in this study was 2.9 minutes, 27.6% shorter than the Tmin previously defined based on COV=15%. Despite the higher average COV, the shorter Tminbeneficial in the lower total18F-FDG activity administered, reduce the internal dose to the patient while producing equivalent image quality.

TITLE: Investigating Low-Dose Image Quality in Whole-Body Pediatric 18F-FDG Scans Using Time-of-Flight PET/MRI

AUTHORS: Jeffrey P Schmall, Suleman Surti, Hansel J Otero, Sabah Servaes, Joel S Karp, Lisa J States

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
In this study, we investigated the diagnostic performance of whole-body18F-FDG imaging using a PET/MRI scanner with time-of-flight capability for low-dose clinical imaging of pediatric patients. In addition to clinically acquired image data using a dosing regimen of 3.7 MBq/kg, images from simulated low-dose regimens (1.9-0.41 MBq/kg) were evaluated using several metrics: SUV quantitation, qualitative image quality, and lesion detectability.Methods:Low-dose images were generated by truncating the list-mode PET data to reduce the count statistics. Changes in PET quantitation for low-dose images were assessed using volume-of-interest analysis of healthy tissue and suspected lesions. Three pediatric radiologists reviewed the image volumes without knowing the dose level. Qualitative image quality was assessed on the basis of Likert scoring. Radiologists were also asked to identify suspected lesions within the liver for PET-only and PET/MR images. Lesion detectability was measured using a receiver-operating-characteristic study and quantified using a free-response receiving-operating-characteristic (FROC) methodology to assess changes in performance for low-dose images.Results:Our analysis of volume-of-interest quantitation showed that SUVs remain stable down to ⅓ dose (1.2 MBq/kg). Likert scoring of PET/MR images showed no noticeable trend with dose level; however, scores of PET-only images were lower for low-dose scans, with a 12% reduction for ⅓-dose images compared with full-dose images. There was minimal change in total lesion count for different dose levels; however, all 3 readers had an increase in false-negatives for ⅓-dose images compared with full-dose images. Using the FROC methodology to quantify lesion-detection performance for human observers, no significant differences were observed for the 3 dosing levels when using the averaged reader data (allPvalues > 0.103). For all readers, the FROC performance was higher for PET/MRI than for PET alone.Conclusion:Reductions to the lowest recommended pediatric dosing regimens are possible when using PET/MRI. The data suggest that the administered dose can be decreased to 2.46 MBq/kg, a 33% reduction in PET activity, with no degradation in image quality, leading to a corresponding reduction in absorbed dose.

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Functional PET (fPET) is a novel technique for studying dynamic changes in brain metabolism and neurotransmitter signaling. Accurate quantification of fPET relies on measuring the arterial input function (AIF), traditionally achieved through invasive arterial blood sampling. While non-invasive image-derived input functions (IDIF) offer an alternative, they suffer from limited spatial resolution and field of view. To overcome these issues, we developed and validated a scan protocol for brain fPET utilizing cardiac IDIF, aiming to mitigate known IDIF limitations.

Methods: Twenty healthy individuals underwent fPET/MR scans using [18F]FDG or 6-[18F]FDOPA, utilizing bed motion shuttling to capture cardiac IDIF and brain task-induced changes. Arterial and venous blood sampling was used to validate IDIFs. Participants performed a monetary incentive delay task. IDIFs from various blood pools and composites estimated from a linear fit over all IDIF blood pools (3VOI) and further supplemented with venous blood samples (3VOIVB) were compared to the AIF. Quantitative task-specific images from both tracers were compared to assess the performance of each input function to the gold standard.

Results: For both radiotracer cohorts, moderate to high agreement (r: 0.60-0.89) between IDIFs and AIF for both radiotracer cohorts was observed, with further improvement (r: 0.87-0.93) for composite IDIFs (3VOI and 3VOIVB). Both methods showed equivalent quantitative values and high agreement (r: 0.975-0.998) with AIF-derived measurements.

Conclusion: Our proposed protocol enables accurate non-invasive estimation of the input function with full quantification of task-specific changes, addressing the limitations of IDIF for brain imaging by sampling larger blood pools over the thorax. These advancements increase applicability to any PET scanner and clinical research setting by reducing experimental complexity and increasing patient comfort.

TITLE: FPGA-based digitizer for BGO-based time-of-flight PET

AUTHORS: Daehee Lee, Sun Il Kwon

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
We present a novel field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-based bismuth germanate (BGO) time-of-flight (TOF) digitizer, implemented on an FPGA (XC7VX485T-2FFG1761C, Xilinx). This digitizer is designed to address the recently highlighted characteristics of BGO, which generates both scintillation and prompt Cerenkov photons when a 511 keV photon interacts with BGO. The developed digitizer independently processes these two types of photons for precise energy and timing measurements. The digitizer incorporates a noise-resistant binary counter that measures energy signals using the time-over-threshold (TOT) method. For timing measurements, we employ an embedded dual-side monitoring time-to-digital converter, which efficiently captures timing information while maintaining low resource usage. We validated the efficacy of our FPGA-based TOF digitizer through extensive experiments, including both electrical testing and coincidence measurements using BGO pixels. Our evaluations of TOT energy and timing performance utilized two 3 × 3 × 20 mm3BGO pixels coupled to CHK-HD MT silicon photomultipliers. The digitizer achieved a coincidence timing resolution (CTR) of 407 ps full width at half maximum (FWHM) for events within the full width at tenth maximum of the photopeak in the measured TOT energy spectrum. Notably, when measured with an oscilloscope, the same detector pair exhibited a CTR of 403 ps FWHM, confirming that the performance of the developed digitizer is comparable to that of an oscilloscope. With its low resource usage, our design offers significant potential for scalability, making it particularly promising for multi-channel BGO-based PET systems.

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Estimation of accurate attenuation maps for whole-body positron emission tomography (PET) imaging in simultaneous PET-MRI systems is a challenging problem as it affects the quantitative nature of the modality. In this study, we aimed to improve the accuracy of estimated attenuation maps from MRI Dixon contrast images by training an augmented generative adversarial network (GANs) in a supervised manner. We augmented the GANs by perturbing the non-linear deformation field during image registration between MRI and the ground truth CT images.

Methods: We acquired the CT and the corresponding PET-MR images for a cohort of 28 prostate cancer patients. Data from 18 patients (2160 slices and later augmented to 270,000 slices) was used for training the GANs and others for validation. We calculated the error in bone and soft tissue regions for the AC μ-maps and the reconstructed PET images.

Results: For quantitative analysis, we use the average relative absolute errors and validate the proposed technique on 10 patients. The DL-based MR methods generated the pseudo-CT AC μ-maps with an accuracy of 4.5% more than standard MR-based techniques. Particularly, the proposed method demonstrates improved accuracy in the pelvic regions without affecting the uptake values. The lowest error of the AC μ-map in the pelvic region was 1.9% for μ-mapGAN + augcompared with 6.4% for μ-mapdixon, 5.9% for μ-mapdixon + bone, 2.1% for μ-mapU-Netand 2.0% for μ-mapU-Net + aug. For the reconstructed PET images, the lowest error was 2.2% for PETGAN + augcompared with 10.3% for PETdixon, 8.7% for PETdixon + bone, 2.6% for PETU-Netand 2.4% for PETU-Net + aug..CONCLUSION: The proposed technique to augment the training datasets for training of the GAN results in improved accuracy of the estimated μ-map and consequently the PET quantification compared to the state of the art.

TITLE: Oxygen extraction fraction mapping with multi-parametric quantitative BOLD MRI: Reduced transverse relaxation bias using 3D-GraSE imaging

AUTHORS: Stephan Kaczmarz, Fahmeed Hyder, Christine Preibisch

JOURNAL: NeuroImage

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based quantification of the blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) effect allows oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) mapping. The multi-parametric quantitative BOLD (mq-BOLD) technique facilitates relative OEF (rOEF) measurements with whole brain coverage in clinically applicable scan times. Mq-BOLD requires three separate scans of cerebral blood volume and transverse relaxation rates measured by gradient-echo (1/T2∗) and spin-echo (1/T2). Although the current method is of clinical merit in patients with stroke, glioma and internal carotid artery stenosis (ICAS), there are relaxation measurement artefacts that impede the sensitivity of mq-BOLD and artificially elevate reported rOEF values. We posited that T2-related biases caused by slice refocusing imperfections during rapid 2D-GraSE (Gradient and Spin Echo) imaging can be reduced by applying 3D-GraSE imaging sequences, because the latter requires no slice selective pulses. The removal of T2-related biases would decrease overestimated rOEF values measured by mq-BOLD. We characterized effects of T2-related bias in mq-BOLD by comparing the initially employed 2D-GraSE and two proposed 3D-GraSE sequences to multiple single spin-echo reference measurements, both in vitro and in vivo. A phantom and 25 participants, including young and elderly healthy controls as well as ICAS-patients, were scanned. We additionally proposed a procedure to reliably identify and exclude artefact affected voxels. In the phantom, 3D-GraSE derived T2values had 57% lower deviation from the reference. For in vivo scans, the formerly overestimated rOEF was reduced by -27% (p ​< ​0.001). We obtained rOEF ​= ​0.51, which is much closer to literature values from positron emission tomography (PET) measurements. Furthermore, increased sensitivity to a focal rOEF elevation in an ICAS-patient was demonstrated. In summary, the application of 3D-GraSE improves the mq-BOLD-based rOEF quantification while maintaining clinically feasible scan times. Thus, mq-BOLD with non-slice selective T2imaging is highly promising to improve clinical diagnostics of cerebrovascular diseases such as ICAS.

TITLE: Performance Characteristics of the Biograph Vision Quadra PET/CT System with a Long Axial Field of View Using the NEMA NU 2-2018 Standard

AUTHORS: George A Prenosil, Hasan Sari, Markus Fürstner, Ali Afshar-Oromieh, Kuangyu Shi, Axel Rominger, Michael Hentschel

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Our purpose was to evaluate the performance of the Biograph Vision Quadra PET/CT system. This new system is based on the Biograph Vision 600, using the same silicon photomultiplier-based detectors with 3.2 × 3.2 × 20 mm lutetium-oxoorthosilicate crystals. The 32 detector rings of the Quadra provide a 4-fold larger axial field of view (AFOV) of 106 cm, enabling imaging of major organs in 1 bed position.Methods:The physical performance of the scanner was evaluated according to the National Electrical Manufacturers Association NU 2-2018 standard, with additional experiments to characterize energy resolution. Image quality was assessed with foreground-to-background ratios of 4:1 and 8:1. Additionally, a clinical18F-FDG PET study was reconstructed with varying frame durations. In all experiments, data were acquired using the maximum ring distance of 322 crystals (MRD 322), whereas image reconstructions could be performed with a maximum ring distance of only 85 crystals (MRD 85).Results:The spatial resolution at full width at half maximum in the radial, tangential, and axial directions was 3.3, 3.4, and 3.8 mm, respectively. The sensitivity was 83 cps/kBq for MRD 85 and 176 cps/kBq for MRD 322. The noise-equivalent count rates (NECRs) at peak were 1,613 kcps for MRD 85 and 2,956 kcps for MRD 322, both at 27.49 kBq/mL. The respective scatter fractions at peak NECR equaled 36% and 37%. The time-of-flight resolution at peak NECR was 228 ps for MRD 85 and 230 ps for MRD 322. Image contrast recovery ranged from 69.6% to 86.9% for 4:1 contrast ratios and from 77.7% to 92.6% for 8:1 contrast ratios reconstructed using point-spread function time of flight with 8 iterations and 5 subsets. Thirty-second frames provided readable lesion detectability and acceptable noise levels in clinical images.Conclusion:The Biograph Vision Quadra PET/CT device has spatial and time resolution similar to those of the Biograph Vision 600 but exhibits improved sensitivity and NECR because of its extended AFOV. The reported spatial resolution, time resolution, and sensitivity make it a competitive new device in the class of PET scanners with an extended AFOV.

JOURNAL: Radiation protection dosimetry

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
We created and validated an open-access AI algorithm (AIc) for assessing image segmentation and patient centering in a multi-body-region, multi-center, and multi-scanner study. Our study included 825 head, chest, and abdomen-pelvis CT from 275 patients (153 females, 128 males; mean age 67 ± 14 years) scanned at five academic and community hospitals. CT images were processed with the AIc to determine vertical and horizontal centering at the skull base (head CT), carina (chest CT), and L2-L3 disc (abdomen CT). We manually measured the vertical and horizontal off-centering. We found strong correlations between AIc and manual estimate of off-centering in both the vertical (head, r = 0.93; chest, r = 0.94; abdomen, and r = 0.95) and horizontal directions (head CT, r = 0.85; chest, r = 0.85; abdomen, r = 0.8) and across age groups (r = 0.70-0.97), gender (r = 0.81-0.96), and multiple scanners from the five sites (r = 0.74-0.99). The AIc area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for centered and off-centered CT exams ranged from 0.72 (head) to 0.99 (chest). Therefore, our study showed that positron-emission tomography/CT (PET/CT) examinations commonly exhibit significant off-centering, particularly with vertical deviations often exceeding 30 mm and horizontal deviations between 10 and 30 mm. In addition, it demonstrated that our AI model can effectively assess both vertical and horizontal off-centering, although it performs better at estimating vertical off-centering.

TITLE: Detection of 18F-FDG Dose Leakage Using a Topical Device

AUTHORS: Stephanie Sanchez, Geoffrey M Currie

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear medicine technology

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
PET and SUV depend on reliable pharmacokinetic modeling, part of which is predictable dose delivery. Partial extravasation of the intravenous dose administered undermines the predictability of dose delivery and, potentially, the accuracy of the SUV calculation. Use of the Lara device with topical sensors is a simple, noninvasive way to determine partial dose extravasation. As part of routine monitoring of18F-FDG PET administrations, an interesting case was identified that mimicked extravasation but represented dose leakage during infusion via an automatic injector. The Lara device provided a useful tool for more timely critical evaluation and problem solving, extending advantages to the patient and practice.

TITLE: The importance of feature aggregation in radiomics: a head and neck cancer study

AUTHORS: Pierre Fontaine, Oscar Acosta, Joël Castelli, Renaud De Crevoisier, Henning Müller, Adrien Depeursinge

JOURNAL: Scientific reports

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
In standard radiomics studies the features extracted from clinical images are mostly quantified with simple statistics such as the average or variance per Region of Interest (ROI). Such approaches may smooth out any intra-region heterogeneity and thus hide some tumor aggressiveness that may hamper predictions. In this paper we study the importance of feature aggregation within the standard radiomics workflow, which allows to take into account intra-region variations. Feature aggregation methods transform a collection of voxel values from feature response maps (over a ROI) into one or several scalar values that are usable for statistical or machine learning algorithms. This important step has been little investigated within the radiomics workflows, so far. In this paper, we compare several aggregation methods with standard radiomics approaches in order to assess the improvements in prediction capabilities. We evaluate the performance using an aggregation function based on Bags of Visual Words (BoVW), which allows for the preservation of piece-wise homogeneous information within heterogeneous regions and compared with standard methods. The different models are compared on a cohort of 214 head and neck cancer patients coming from 4 medical centers. Radiomics features were extracted from manually delineated tumors in clinical PET-FDG and CT images were analyzed. We compared the performance of standard radiomics models, the volume of the ROI alone and the BoVW model for survival analysis. The average concordance index was estimated with a five fold cross-validation. The performance was significantly better using the BoVW model 0.627 (95% CI: 0.616-0.637) as compared to standard radiomics0.505 (95% CI: 0.499-0.511), mean-var. 0.543 (95% CI: 0.536-0.549), mean0.547 (95% CI: 0.541-0.554), var.0.530 (95% CI: 0.524-0.536) or volume 0.577 (95% CI: 0.571-0.582). We conclude that classical aggregation methods are not optimal in case of heterogeneous tumors. We also showed that the BoVW model is a better alternative to extract consistent features in the presence of lesions composed of heterogeneous tissue.

TITLE: CAD-based hardware attenuation correction in PET/MRI: First methodical investigations and clinical application of a 16-channel RF breast coil

AUTHORS: Maike E Lindemann, Mark Oehmigen, Titus Lanz, Hong Grafe, Nils Martin Bruckmann, Lale Umutlu, Harald H Quick

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Aim of this study was to evaluate the use of computer-aided design (CAD) models for attenuation correction (AC) of hardware components in positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance (PET/MR) imaging.

Methods: The technical feasibility and quantitative impact of CAD-AC compared to computer tomography (CT)-based AC (reference) was investigated on a modular phantom consisting of 19 different material samples (plastics and metals arranged around a cylindrical emission phantom) typically used in phantoms, patient tables, and radiofrequency (RF) coils in PET/MR. The clinical applicability of the CAD-AC method was then evaluated on a 16-channel RF breast coil in a PET/MR patient study. The RF breast coil in this study was specifically designed PET compatible. Using this RF breast coil, the impact on clinical PET/MR breast imaging was systematically evaluated in breast phantom measurements and, furthermore, in n = 10 PET/MR patients with breast cancer. PET data were reconstructed three times: (1) no AC (NAC), (2) established CT-AC, and (3) CAD-AC. For both phantom measurements, a scan without attenuating hardware components (material probes or RF breast coil) was acquired serving as reference. Relative differences in PET data were calculated for all experiments.

Results: In all phantom and patient measurements, significant gains in PET signal compared to NAC data were measurable with CT and CAD-AC. In initial phantom experiments, mean relative differences of -0.2% for CT-AC and 0.2% for CAD-AC were calculated compared to reference measurements without the material probes. The application to a RF breast coil depicts that CAD-AC results in significant gains compared to NAC data (10%) and a slight underestimation in PET signal of -1.3% in comparison to the no-coil reference measurement. In the patient study, a total of 15 congruent lesions in all 10 patients with a mean relative difference of 14% (CT and CAD-AC) in standardized uptake value compared to NAC data could be detected.

Conclusions: To ensure best possible PET image quality and accurate PET quantification in PET/MR imaging, the AC of hardware components such as phantoms and RF coils is important. In initial phantom experiments and in clinical application to an RF breast coil, it was found that CAD-based AC results in significant gains in PET signal compared to NAC data and provides comparably good results to the established method of CT-based AC.

JOURNAL: Annals of nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Objective: To develop a practical method to rapidly utilize a deep learning model to automatically extract image features based on a small number of SPECT brain perfusion images in general clinics to objectively evaluate Alzheimer's disease (AD).

Methods: For the properties of low cost and convenient access in general clinics, Tc-99-ECD SPECT imaging data in brain perfusion detection was used in this study for AD detection. Two-stage transfer learning based on the Inception v3 network model was performed using the ImageNet dataset and ADNI database. To improve training accuracy, the three-dimensional image was reorganized into three sets of two-dimensional images for data augmentation and ensemble learning. The effect of pre-training parameters for Tc-99m-ECD SPECT image to distinguish AD from normal cognition (NC) was investigated, as well as the effect of the sample size of F-18-FDG PET images used in pre-training. The same model was also fine-tuned for the prediction of the MMSE score from the Tc-99m-ECD SPECT image.

Results: The AUC values of w/wo pre-training parameters for Tc-99m-ECD SPECT image to distinguish AD from NC were 0.86 and 0.90. The sensitivity, specificity, precision, accuracy, and F1 score were 100%, 75%, 76%, 86%, and 86%, respectively for the training model with 1000 cases of F-18-FDG PET image for pre-training. The AUC values for various sample sizes of the training dataset (100, 200, 400, 800, 1000 cases) for pre-training were 0.86, 0.91, 0.95, 0.97, and 0.97. Regardless of the pre-training condition ECD dataset used, the AUC value was greater than 0.85. Finally, predicting cognitive scores and MMSE scores correlated (R2= 0.7072).

Conclusions: With the ADNI pre-trained model, the sensitivity and accuracy of the proposed deep learning model using SPECT ECD perfusion images to differentiate AD from NC were increased by approximately 30% and 10%, respectively. Our study indicated that the model trained on PET FDG metabolic imaging for the same disease could be transferred to a small sample of SPECT cerebral perfusion images. This model will contribute to the practicality of SPECT cerebral perfusion images using deep learning technology to objectively recognize AD.

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: This study evaluates the impact of partial volume effect (PVE) correction on [18F]fluoromisonidazole (FMISO) PET images, focusing on the conversion of standardized uptake values (SUV) to partial oxygen pressure (pO2) and the subsequent determination of hypoxic tumor volume (HTV).

Methods: FMISO PET images from 49 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cases were retrospectively corrected for PVE and converted to pO2. A pO2threshold of 10 mmHg was used to delineate the HTV (HTVpO2). Comparisons of pO2distribution and HTVpO2between corrected and uncorrected images were made, with pO2distributions evaluated against published polarographic data. HTVpO2was compared to HTV defined by the conventional tumor-to-muscle ratio (TMR) method (HTVTMR) in terms of volume and topography (DICE coefficient, Hausdorff distance, and center-of-gravity distance) across different TMR cutoff levels. The cutoff level where the segmentation results from both methods were most similar was identified (TMRbest).

Results: The PVE correction led to decreased minimum pO2, increased HTVpO2and the identification of more hypoxic cases (HTV > 0). The pO2distribution demonstrated improved alignment with published polarographic data. At TMRbest1.6, the center-of-gravity distance between HTVTMRand HTVpO2demonstrated a low median at 1.5 mm, while the wide range (0.0 to 9.6 mm) indicated high interpatient variability. The shape of HTV exhibited considerable variation with DICE 0.74 (0.03 to 1.00) and Hausdorff distance 8.5 mm (2.0 to 42.8 mm).

Conclusions: PVE correction is recommended before converting SUV to pO2for the spatially resolved quantification of hypoxia.

ABSTRACT:
Objective.Time resolution is crucial in positron emission tomography (PET) to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio and image quality. Moreover, high sensitivity requires long scintillators, which can cause distortions in the reconstructed images due to parallax effects. This study evaluates the performance of a time-of-flight (TOF)-PET module that makes use of a single-side readout of a4×43.1×3.1×15mm3LYSO:Ce matrix with an array of4×4silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) and a light guide to extract high-resolution TOF and depth of interaction (DOI) information.Approach.This study assesses the performance of the detector prototype using the commercially available TOFPET2 ASIC and SiPMs from various producers. DOI and TOF performance are compared to results using custom-made NINO 32-chip based electronics.Main results.Using a Broadcom NUV-MT array, the detector module read out by the TOFPET2 ASIC demonstrates a DOI resolution of 2.6 ± 0.2 mm full width at half maximum (FWHM) and a coincidence time resolution (CTR) of 216 ± 6 ps FWHM. When read out using the NINO 32-chip based electronics, the same module achieves a DOI resolution of 2.5 ± 0.2 mm and a CTR of 170 ± 5 ps.Significance.The prototype module, read out by commercial electronics and using state-of-the-art SiPMs, achieves a DOI performance comparable to that obtained with custom-made electronics and a CTR of around 200 ps. This approach is scalable to thousands of channels, with only a deterioration in timing resolution compared to the custom-made electronics, which achieve a CTR of 140 ps using a standard non-DOI module.

TITLE: Reinventing radiation therapy with machine learning and imaging bio-markers (radiomics): State-of-the-art, challenges and perspectives

AUTHORS: Laurent Dercle, Theophraste Henry, Alexandre Carré, Nikos Paragios, Eric Deutsch, Charlotte Robert

JOURNAL: Methods (San Diego, Calif.)

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Radiation therapy is a pivotal cancer treatment that has significantly progressed over the last decade due to numerous technological breakthroughs. Imaging is now playing a critical role on deployment of the clinical workflow, both for treatment planning and treatment delivery. Machine-learning analysis of predefined features extracted from medical images, i.e. radiomics, has emerged as a promising clinical tool for a wide range of clinical problems addressing drug development, clinical diagnosis, treatment selection and implementation as well as prognosis. Radiomics denotes a paradigm shift redefining medical images as a quantitative asset for data-driven precision medicine. The adoption of machine-learning in a clinical setting and in particular of radiomics features requires the selection of robust, representative and clinically interpretable biomarkers that are properly evaluated on a representative clinical data set. To be clinically relevant, radiomics must not only improve patients' management with great accuracy but also be reproducible and generalizable. Hence, this review explores the existing literature and exposes its potential technical caveats, such as the lack of quality control, standardization, sufficient sample size, type of data collection, and external validation. Based upon the analysis of 165 original research studies based on PET, CT-scan, and MRI, this review provides an overview of new concepts, and hypotheses generating findings that should be validated. In particular, it describes evolving research trends to enhance several clinical tasks such as prognostication, treatment planning, response assessment, prediction of recurrence/relapse, and prediction of toxicity. Perspectives regarding the implementation of an AI-based radiotherapy workflow are presented.

TITLE: Deep learning-guided estimation of attenuation correction factors from time-of-flight PET emission data

AUTHORS: Hossein Arabi, Habib Zaidi

JOURNAL: Medical image analysis

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Attenuation correction (AC) is essential for quantitative PET imaging. In the absence of concurrent CT scanning, for instance on hybrid PET/MRI systems or dedicated brain PET scanners, an accurate approach for synthetic CT generation is highly desired. In this work, a novel framework is proposed wherein attenuation correction factors (ACF) are estimated from time-of-flight (TOF) PET emission data using deep learning.

Methods: In this approach, referred to as called DL-EM), the different TOF sinogram bins pertinent to the same slice are fed into a multi-input channel deep convolutional network to estimate a single ACF sinogram associated with the same slice. The clinical evaluation of the proposed DL-EM approach consisted of 68 clinical brain TOF PET/CT studies, where CT-based attenuation correction (CTAC) served as reference. A two-tissue class consisting of background-air and soft-tissue segmentation of the TOF PET non-AC images (SEG) as a proxy of the technique used in the clinic was also included in the comparative evaluation. Qualitative and quantitative PET analysis was performed through SUV bias maps quantification in 63 different brain regions.

Results: The DL-EM approach resulted in 6.1 ± 9.7% relative mean absolute error (RMAE) in bony structures compared to SEG AC method with RMAE of 16.1 ± 8.2% (p-value <0.001). Considering the entire head region, DL-EM led to a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.3 ± 0.01 outperforming the SEG method with RMSE of 0.8 ± 0.02 SUV (p-value <0.001). The region-wise analysis of brain PET studies revealed less than 7% absolute SUV bias for the DL-EM approach, whereas the SEG method resulted in more than 14% absolute SUV bias (p-value <0.05).

Conclusions: Qualitative assessment and quantitative PET analysis demonstrated the superior performance of the DL-EM approach over the segmentation-based technique with clinically acceptable SUV bias. The results obtained using the DL-EM approach are comparable to state-of-the-art MRI-guided AC methods. Yet, this approach enables the extraction of interesting features about patient-specific attenuation which could be employed not only as a stand-alone AC approach but also as complementary/prior information in other AC algorithms.

TITLE: Haralick texture features extracted from Ga-68 PSMA PET/CT to differentiate normal prostate from prostate cancer: a feasibility study

AUTHORS: Akshima Sharma, Sanjay Kumar, Anil Kumar Pandey, Geetanjali Arora, Anshul Sharma, Amlesh Seth, Rakesh Kumar

JOURNAL: Nuclear medicine communications

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Objective: Role of texture parameters on the basis of Ga-68 PSMA PET/CT in prostate cancer (Pca) is largely unexplored. Present work done is a preliminary study that aims to evaluate the role of Haralick texture features on the basis of Ga-68 PSMA PET/CT in Pca in which texture features were used to differentiate between normal prostate and Pca tissue.

Methods: The study retrospectively enrolled patients in two groups: group 1 included 30 patients with biopsy-proven adenocarcinoma prostate and median age 64 years (range: 50-82 years) who underwent baseline Ga-68 PSMA PET/CT prior to therapy; group 2 included 24 patients with pathologies other than Pca and median age 53.5 years (range: 18-80 years) who underwent Ga-68 PSMA PET/CT as part of another study in our department. Patients in group 2 did not have any prostate pathology and served as controls for the study. The segmented images of prostate (3-D image) were used to calculate 11 Haralick texture features in MATLAB. SUVmax was also evaluated. All parameters were compared among the two groups using appropriate statistical analysis and P value <0.05 was considered significant.

Results: All 11 Haralick texture features, as well as SUVmax, were significantly different among Pca and controls (P < 0.05). Among the texture features, contrast was most significant (P value of Mann-Whitney U <0.001) in differentiating Pca from normal prostate with AUROC curve of 82.9% with sensitivity and specificity 83.30% and 73.30%, respectively at cut-off 0.640. SUVmax was also significant with AUROC curve 94.0% and sensitivity and specificity 62.5% and 90%, respectively at cut-off 5.7. A significant negative correlation of SUVmax was observed with contrast.

Conclusion: Haralick texture features have a significant role in differentiating Pca and normal prostate.

TITLE: Impact of deep learning denoising on kinetic modelling for low-dose dynamic PET: application to single- and dual-tracer imaging protocols

AUTHORS: Florence M Muller, Elizabeth J Li, Margaret E Daube-Witherspoon, Austin R Pantel, Corinde E Wiers, Jacob G Dubroff, Christian Vanhove, Stefaan Vandenberghe, Joel S Karp

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Long-axial field-of-view PET scanners capture multi-organ tracer distribution with high sensitivity, enabling lower dose dynamic protocols and dual-tracer imaging for comprehensive disease characterization. However, reducing dose may compromise data quality and time-activity curve (TAC) fitting, leading to higher bias in kinetic parameters. Parametric imaging poses further challenges due to noise amplification in voxel-based modelling. We explore the potential of deep learning denoising (DL-DN) to improve quantification for low-dose dynamic PET.

Methods: Using 16 [18F]FDG PET studies from the PennPET Explorer, we trained a DL framework on 10-min images from late-phase uptake (static data) that were sub-sampled from 1/2 to 1/300 of the counts. This model was used to denoise early-to-late dynamic frame images. Its impact on quantification was evaluated using compartmental modelling and voxel-based graphical analysis for parametric imaging for single- and dual-tracer dynamic studies with [18F]FDG and [18F]FGln at original (injected) and reduced (sub-sampled) doses. Quantification differences were evaluated for the area under the curve of TACs, Kifor [18F]FDG and VTfor [18F]FGln, and parametric images.

Results: DL-DN consistently improved image quality across all dynamic frames, systematically enhancing TAC consistency and reducing tissue-dependent bias and variability in Kiand VTdown to 40 MBq doses. DL-DN preserved tumor heterogeneity in Logan VTimages and delineation of high-flux regions in Patlak Kimaps. In a /[18F]FDG dual-tracer study, bias trends aligned with single-tracer results but showed reduced accuracy for [¹⁸F]FGln in breast lesions at very low doses (4 MBq).

Conclusion: This study demonstrates that applying DL-DN trained on static [18F]FDG PET images to dynamic [18F]FDG and [18F]FGln PET can permit significantly reduced doses, preserving accurate FDG Kiand FGln VTmeasurements, and enhancing parametric image quality. DL-DN shows promise for improving dynamic PET quantification at reduced doses, including novel dual-tracer studies.

TITLE: Ultra-high energy spectral prompt PET

AUTHORS: Satyajit Ghosh, Valerio Cosmi, Ruud M Ramakers, Freek J Beekman, Marlies C Goorden

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Objective.Utilizing prompt gammas in preclinical pinhole-collimated positron emission tomography (PET) avoids image degradation due to positron range blurring and photon down scatter, enables multi-isotope PET and can improve counting statistics for low-abundance positron emitters. This was earlier reported for124I,89Zr and simultaneous124I -18F PET using the VECTor scanner (MILabs, The Netherlands), demonstrating sub-mm resolution despite long positron ranges. The aim of the present study is to investigate if such sub-mm PET imaging is also feasible for a large variety of other isotopes including those with extremely high energy prompt gammas (>1 MeV) or with complex emission spectra of prompt gammas.Approach.We use Monte Carlo simulations to assess achievable image resolutions and uniformity across a broad range of spectrum types and emitted prompt gamma energies (603 keV-2.2 MeV), using52Mn,94Tc,89Zr,44Sc,86Y,72As,124I,38K, and66Ga.Main results.Our results indicate that sub-millimeter resolution imaging may be feasible for almost all isotopes investigated, with the currently used cluster pinhole collimators. At prompt gamma energies of 603 keV of124I, an image resolution of ∼0.65 mm was achieved, while for emissions at 703, 744, 834, and 909 keV of94Tc,52Mn,72As, and89Zr, respectively, ∼0.7 mm resolution was obtained. Finally, at ultra-high energies of 1.2 (44Sc) and 1.4 MeV (52Mn) resolutions of ∼0.75 mm and ∼0.8 mm could still be achieved although ring artifacts were observed at the highest energies (1.4 MeV). For38K (2.2 MeV), an image resolution of 1.2 mm was achieved utilizing its 2.2 MeV prompt emission.Significance.This work shows that current cluster pinhole collimators are suitable for sub-mm resolution prompt PET up till at least 1.4 MeV. This may open up new avenues to developing new tracer applications and therapies utilizing these PET isotopes.

TITLE: Development and validation of a longitudinal soft-tissue metastatic lesion matching algorithm

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Metastatic cancer presents with many, sometimes hundreds of metastatic lesions through the body, which often respond heterogeneously to treatment. Therefore, lesion-level assessment is necessary for a complete understanding of disease response. Lesion-level assessment typically requires manual matching of corresponding lesions, which is a tedious, subjective, and error-prone task. This study introduces a fully automated algorithm for matching of metastatic lesions in longitudinal medical images. The algorithm entails four steps: (1) image registration, (2) lesion dilation, (3) lesion clustering, and (4) linear assignment. In step (1), 3D deformable registration is used to register the scans. In step (2), lesion contours are conformally dilated. In step (3), lesion clustering is evaluated based on local metrics. In step (4), matching is assigned based on non-greedy cost minimization. The algorithm was optimized (e.g. choice of deformable registration algorithm, dilatation size) and validated on 140 scan-pairs of 32 metastatic cancer patients from two independent clinical trials, who received longitudinal PET/CT scans as part of their treatment response assessment. Registration error was evaluated using landmark distance. A sensitivity study was performed to evaluate the optimal lesion dilation magnitude. Lesion matching performance accuracy was evaluated for all patients and for a subset with high disease burden. Two investigated deformable registration approaches (whole body deformable and articulated deformable registrations) led to similar performance with the overall registration accuracy between 2.3 and 2.6 mm. The optimal dilation magnitude of 25 mm yielded almost a perfect matching accuracy of 0.98. No significant matching accuracy decrease was observed in the subset of patients with high lesion disease burden. In summary, lesion matching using our new algorithm was highly accurate and a significant improvement, when compared to previously established methods. The proposed method enables accurate automated metastatic lesion matching in whole-body longitudinal scans.

TITLE: MRI-guided attenuation correction in torso PET/MRI: Assessment of segmentation-, atlas-, and deep learning-based approaches in the presence of outliers

AUTHORS: Hossein Arabi, Habib Zaidi

JOURNAL: Magnetic resonance in medicine

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: We compare the performance of three commonly used MRI-guided attenuation correction approaches in torso PET/MRI, namely segmentation-, atlas-, and deep learning-based algorithms.

Methods: Twenty-five co-registered torso18F-FDG PET/CT and PET/MR images were enrolled. PET attenuation maps were generated from in-phase Dixon MRI using a three-tissue class segmentation-based approach (soft-tissue, lung, and background air), voxel-wise weighting atlas-based approach, and a residual convolutional neural network. The bias in standardized uptake value (SUV) was calculated for each approach considering CT-based attenuation corrected PET images as reference. In addition to the overall performance assessment of these approaches, the primary focus of this work was on recognizing the origins of potential outliers, notably body truncation, metal-artifacts, abnormal anatomy, and small malignant lesions in the lungs.

Results: The deep learning approach outperformed both atlas- and segmentation-based methods resulting in less than 4% SUV bias across 25 patients compared to the segmentation-based method with up to 20% SUV bias in bony structures and the atlas-based method with 9% bias in the lung. The deep learning-based method exhibited superior performance. Yet, in case of sever truncation and metallic-artifacts in the input MRI, this approach was outperformed by the atlas-based method, exhibiting suboptimal performance in the affected regions. Conversely, for abnormal anatomies, such as a patient presenting with one lung or small malignant lesion in the lung, the deep learning algorithm exhibited promising performance compared to other methods.

Conclusion: The deep learning-based method provides promising outcome for synthetic CT generation from MRI. However, metal-artifact and body truncation should be specifically addressed.

AUTHORS: Kevin T Chen, Tyler N Toueg, Mary Ellen Irene Koran, Guido Davidzon, Michael Zeineh, Dawn Holley, Harsh Gandhi, Kim Halbert, Athanasia Boumis, Gabriel Kennedy, Elizabeth Mormino, Mehdi Khalighi, Greg Zaharchuk

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: While sampled or short-frame realizations have shown the potential power of deep learning to reduce radiation dose for PET images, evidence in true injected ultra-low-dose cases is lacking. Therefore, we evaluated deep learning enhancement using a significantly reduced injected radiotracer protocol for amyloid PET/MRI.

Methods: Eighteen participants underwent two separate18F-florbetaben PET/MRI studies in which an ultra-low-dose (6.64 ± 3.57 MBq, 2.2 ± 1.3% of standard) or a standard-dose (300 ± 14 MBq) was injected. The PET counts from the standard-dose list-mode data were also undersampled to approximate an ultra-low-dose session. A pre-trained convolutional neural network was fine-tuned using MR images and either the injected or sampled ultra-low-dose PET as inputs. Image quality of the enhanced images was evaluated using three metrics (peak signal-to-noise ratio, structural similarity, and root mean square error), as well as the coefficient of variation (CV) for regional standard uptake value ratios (SUVRs). Mean cerebral uptake was correlated across image types to assess the validity of the sampled realizations. To judge clinical performance, four trained readers scored image quality on a five-point scale (using 15% non-inferiority limits for proportion of studies rated 3 or better) and classified cases into amyloid-positive and negative studies.

Results: The deep learning-enhanced PET images showed marked improvement on all quality metrics compared with the low-dose images as well as having generally similar regional CVs as the standard-dose. All enhanced images were non-inferior to their standard-dose counterparts. Accuracy for amyloid status was high (97.2% and 91.7% for images enhanced from injected and sampled ultra-low-dose data, respectively) which was similar to intra-reader reproducibility of standard-dose images (98.6%).

Conclusion: Deep learning methods can synthesize diagnostic-quality PET images from ultra-low injected dose simultaneous PET/MRI data, demonstrating the general validity of sampled realizations and the potential to reduce dose significantly for amyloid imaging.

TITLE: Hepatocellular carcinoma 18F-FDG PET/CT kinetic parameter estimation based on the advantage actor-critic algorithm

AUTHORS: Jianfeng He, Siming Li, Yiwei Xiong, Yu Yao, Siyu Wang, Sidan Wang, Shaobo Wang

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Background: Kinetic parameters estimated with dynamic18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) help characterize hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) can improve kinetic parameter estimation.

Purpose: The advantage actor-critic (A2C) algorithm is a DRL algorithm with neural networks that seek the optimal parameters. The aim of this study was to preliminarily assess the role of the A2C algorithm in estimating the kinetic parameters of18F-FDG PET/CT in patients with HCC.

Materials and methods: 18F-FDG PET data from 14 liver tissues and 17 HCC tumors obtained via a previously developed, abbreviated acquisition protocol (5-min dynamic PET/CT imaging supplemented with 1-min static imaging at 60 min) were prospectively collected. The A2C algorithm was used to estimate kinetic parameters with a reversible double-input, three-compartment model, and the results were compared with those of the conventional nonlinear least squares (NLLS) algorithm. Fitting errors were compared via the root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) of the time activity curves (TACs).

Results: Significant differences in K1, k2, k3, k4, fa, and vbaccording to the A2C algorithm and k3, fa, and vbaccording to the NLLS algorithm were detected between HCC and normal liver tissues (all p < 0.05). Furthermore, A2C demonstrated superior diagnostic performance over NLLS in terms of k3and vb(both p < 0.05 in the Delong test). Notably, A2C yielded a smaller fitting error for normal liver tissue (0.62 ± 0.24 vs. 1.04 ± 1.00) and HCC tissue (1.40 ± 0.42 vs. 1.51 ± 0.97) than did NLLS.

Conclusions: Compared with the conventional postreconstruction NLLS method, the A2C algorithm can more precisely estimate18F-FDG kinetic parameters with a reversible double-input, three-compartment model for HCC tumors, attaining better TAC fitting with a lower RMSE.

TITLE: QAIS-DSNN: Tumor Area Segmentation of MRI Image with Optimized Quantum Matched-Filter Technique and Deep Spiking Neural Network

AUTHORS: Mohsen Ahmadi, Abbas Sharifi, Shayan Hassantabar, Saman Enayati

JOURNAL: BioMed research international

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Tumor segmentation in brain MRI images is a noted process that can make the tumor easier to diagnose and lead to effective radiotherapy planning. Providing and building intelligent medical systems can be considered as an aid for physicians. In many cases, the presented methods' reliability is at a high level, and such systems are used directly. In recent decades, several methods of segmentation of various images, such as MRI, CT, and PET, have been proposed for brain tumors. Advanced brain tumor segmentation has been a challenging issue in the scientific community. The reason for this is the existence of various tumor dimensions with disproportionate boundaries in medical imaging. This research provides an optimized MRI segmentation method to diagnose tumors. It first offers a preprocessing approach to reduce noise with a new method called Quantum Matched-Filter Technique (QMFT). Then, the deep spiking neural network (DSNN) is implemented for segmentation using the conditional random field structure. However, a new algorithm called the Quantum Artificial Immune System (QAIS) is used in its SoftMax layer due to its slowness and nonsegmentation and the identification of suitable features for selection and extraction. The proposed approach, called QAIS-DSNN, has a high ability to segment and distinguish brain tumors from MRI images. The simulation results using the BraTS2018 dataset show that the accuracy of the proposed approach is 98.21%, average error-squared rate is 0.006, signal-to-noise ratio is 97.79 dB, and lesion structure criteria including the tumor nucleus are 80.15%. The improved tumor is 74.50%, and the entire tumor is 91.92%, which shows a functional advantage over similar previous methods. Also, the execution time of this method is 2.58 seconds.

TITLE: Prognostic Significance of 18 F-FDG PET/CT Radiomics in Patients With Resectable Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Undergoing Curative Surgery

AUTHORS: Jang Yoo, Seung Hyup Hyun, Jaeho Lee, Miju Cheon, Kwang Hyuck Lee, Jin Seok Heo, Joon Young Choi

JOURNAL: Clinical nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: This study aimed to investigate the prognostic significance of PET/CT radiomics to predict overall survival (OS) in patients with resectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).

Methods: We enrolled 627 patients with resectable PDAC who underwent preoperative 18 F-FDG PET/CT and subsequent curative surgery. Radiomics analysis of the PET/CT images for the primary tumor was performed using the Chang-Gung Image Texture Analysis toolbox. Radiomics features were subjected to least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression to select the most valuable imaging features of OS. The prognostic significance was evaluated by Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Conventional PET parameters and LASSO score were assessed as predictive factors for OS by time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curve analysis.

Results: During a mean follow-up of 28.8 months, 378 patients (60.3%) died. In the multivariable Cox regression analysis, tumor differentiation, resection margin status, tumor stage, and LASSO score were independent prognostic factors for OS (HR, 1.753, 1.669, 2.655, and 2.946; all P < 0.001, respectively). The time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that the LASSO score had better predictive performance for OS than conventional PET parameters.

Conclusions: The LASSO score using the 18 F-FDG PET/CT radiomics of the primary tumor was the independent prognostic factor for predicting OS in patients with resectable PDAC and may be helpful in determining therapeutic and follow-up plans for these patients.

ABSTRACT:
Brain imaging using conventional head coils presents several problems in routine magnetic resonance (MR) examination, such as anxiety and claustrophobic reactions during scanning with a head coil, photon attenuation caused by the MRI head coil in positron emission tomography (PET)/MRI, and coil constraints in intraoperative MRI or MRI-guided radiotherapy. In this paper, we propose a super resolution generative adversarial (SRGAN-VGG) network-based approach to enhance low-quality brain images scanned with body coils. Two types of T1 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images scanned with different coils were obtained in this study: joint images of the head-neck coil and digital surround technology body coil (H+B images) and body coil images (B images). The deep learning (DL) model was trained using images acquired from 36 subjects and tested in 4 subjects. Both quantitative and qualitative image quality assessment methods were performed during evaluation. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used for statistical analysis. Quantitative image quality assessment showed an improved structural similarity index (SSIM) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) in gray matter and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tissues for DL images compared with B images (P <.01), while the mean square error (MSE) was significantly decreased (P <.05). The analysis also showed that the natural image quality evaluator (NIQE) and blind image quality index (BIQI) were significantly lower for DL images than for B images (P <.0001). Qualitative scoring results indicated that DL images showed an improved SNR, image contrast and sharpness (P<.0001). The outcomes of this study preliminarily indicate that body coils can be used in brain imaging, making it possible to expand the application of MR-based brain imaging.

AUTHORS: Changhui Jiang, Xu Zhang, Na Zhang, Qiyang Zhang, Chao Zhou, Jianmin Yuan, Qiang He, Yongfeng Yang, Xin Liu, Hairong Zheng, Wei Fan, Zhanli Hu, Dong Liang

ABSTRACT:
Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging can be used for early detection, diagnosis and postoperative patient monitoring of many diseases. Traditional PET imaging requires not only additional computed tomography (CT) imaging or magnetic resonance imaging (MR) to provide anatomical information but also attenuation correction (AC) map calculation based on CT images or MR images for accurate quantitative estimation. During a patient's treatment, PET/CT or PET/MR scans are inevitably repeated many times, leading to additional doses of ionizing radiation (CT scans) and additional economic and time costs (MR scans). To reduce adverse effects while obtaining high-quality PET/MR images in the course of a patient's treatment, especially in the stage of evaluating the effect of postoperative treatment, in this work, we propose a new method based on deep learning, which can directly obtain synthetic attenuation-corrected PET (sAC PET) and synthetic T1-weighted MR (sMR) images based only on non-attenuation-corrected PET (NAC PET) images. Our model, based on the Wasserstein generative adversarial network, first removes noise and artifacts from the NAC PET images to generate sAC PET images and then generates sMR images from the obtained sAC PET images. To evaluate the performance of this generative model, we evaluated it on paired PET/MR images from a total of eighty clinical patients. Based on qualitative and quantitative analysis, the generated sAC PET and sMR images showed a high degree of similarity to the real AC PET and real MR images. These results indicated that our proposed method can reduce the frequency of additional anatomical imaging scans during PET imaging and has great potential in improving doctors' clinical diagnosis efficiency, saving patients' economic expenditure and reducing the radiation risk brought by CT scanning.

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: We aimed to evaluate the performance of deep learning-based generalization of ultra-low-count amyloid PET/MRI enhancement when applied to studies acquired with different scanning hardware and protocols.

Methods: Eighty simultaneous [18F]florbetaben PET/MRI studies were acquired, split equally between two sites (site 1: Signa PET/MRI, GE Healthcare, 39 participants, 67 ± 8 years, 23 females; site 2: mMR, Siemens Healthineers, 64 ± 11 years, 23 females) with different MRI protocols. Twenty minutes of list-mode PET data (90-110 min post-injection) were reconstructed as ground-truth. Ultra-low-count data obtained from undersampling by a factor of 100 (site 1) or the first minute of PET acquisition (site 2) were reconstructed for ultra-low-dose/ultra-short-time (1% dose and 5% time, respectively) PET images. A deep convolution neural network was pre-trained with site 1 data and either (A) directly applied or (B) trained further on site 2 data using transfer learning. Networks were also trained from scratch based on (C) site 2 data or (D) all data. Certified physicians determined amyloid uptake (+/-) status for accuracy and scored the image quality. The peak signal-to-noise ratio, structural similarity, and root-mean-squared error were calculated between images and their ground-truth counterparts. Mean regional standardized uptake value ratios (SUVR, reference region: cerebellar cortex) from 37 successful site 2 FreeSurfer segmentations were analyzed.

Results: All network-synthesized images had reduced noise than their ultra-low-count reconstructions. Quantitatively, image metrics improved the most using method B, where SUVRs had the least variability from the ground-truth and the highest effect size to differentiate between positive and negative images. Method A images had lower accuracy and image quality than other methods; images synthesized from methods B-D scored similarly or better than the ground-truth images.

Conclusions: Deep learning can successfully produce diagnostic amyloid PET images from short frame reconstructions. Data bias should be considered when applying pre-trained deep ultra-low-count amyloid PET/MRI networks for generalization.

ABSTRACT:
Tumor vasculature and angiogenesis play a crucial role in tumor progression. Their visualization is therefore of utmost importance to the community. In this proof-of-principle study, we have established a novel cross-modality imaging (CMI) pipeline to characterize exactly the same murine tumors across scales and penetration depths, using orthotopic models of melanoma cancer. This allowed the acquisition of a comprehensive set of vascular parameters for a single tumor. The workflow visualizes capillaries at different length scales, puts them into the context of the overall tumor vessel network and allows quantification and comparison of vessel densities and morphologies by different modalities. The workflow adds information about hypoxia and blood flow rates. The CMI approach includes well-established technologies such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), computed tomography (CT), and ultrasound (US), and modalities that are recent entrants into preclinical discovery such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) and high-resolution episcopic microscopy (HREM). This novel CMI platform establishes the feasibility of combining these technologies using an extensive image processing pipeline. Despite the challenges pertaining to the integration of microscopic and macroscopic data across spatial resolutions, we also established an open-source pipeline for the semi-automated co-registration of the diverse multiscale datasets, which enables truly correlative vascular imaging. Although focused on tumor vasculature, our CMI platform can be used to tackle a multitude of research questions in cancer biology.

TITLE: Preoperative prediction of lymph node metastasis in colorectal cancer using 18F-FDG PET/CT peritumoral radiomics analysis

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Background: Radiomics has been used in the diagnosis of tumor lymph node metastasis (LNM). However, to date, most studies have been based on intratumoral radiomics. Few studies have focused on the use of18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission computed tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT) peritumoral radiomics for the diagnosis of LNM in colorectal cancer (CRC).

Purpose: Determining the value of radiomics features extracted from18F-FDG PET/CT images of the peritumoral region in predicting LNM in patients with CRC.

Methods: The clinical data and preoperative18F-FDG PET/CT images of 244 CRC patients were retrospectively analyzed. Intratumoral and peritumoral radiomics features were screened using the mutual information method, and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression. Based on the selected radiomics features, a radiomics score (Rad-score) was calculated, and independent risk factors obtained from univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to construct clinical and combined (Radiomics + Clinical) models. The performance of these models was evaluated using the DeLong test, while their clinical utility was assessed by decision curve analysis. Finally, a nomogram was constructed to visualize the predictive model.

Results: The most optimal set of features retained by the feature filtering process were all peritumoral radiomic features. Carcinoembryonic antigen levels, PET/CT-reported lymph node status and Rad-score were found to be independent risk factors for LNM. All three LNM risk assessment models exhibited good predictive performance, with the combined model showing the best classification results, with areas under the curve of 0.85 and 0.76 in the training and validation groups, respectively. The DeLong test revealed that the performance of the combined model was superior to that of the clinical and radiomics models in both the training and validation groups, although this difference was only statistically significant in the training group. DCA indicated that the combined model displayed better clinical utility.

Conclusions: 18F-FDG PET/CT peritumoral radiomics is uniquely suited to predict the presence of LNM in patients with CRC. In particular, the predictive efficacy of LNM for precision therapy and individualized patient management can be improved by using a combination of clinical risk factors.

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: A critical bottleneck for the credibility of artificial intelligence (AI) is replicating the results in the diversity of clinical practice. We aimed to develop an AI that can be independently applied to recover high-quality imaging from low-dose scans on different scanners and tracers.

Methods: Brain [18F]FDG PET imaging of 237 patients scanned with one scanner was used for the development of AI technology. The developed algorithm was then tested on [18F]FDG PET images of 45 patients scanned with three different scanners, [18F]FET PET images of 18 patients scanned with two different scanners, as well as [18F]Florbetapir images of 10 patients. A conditional generative adversarial network (GAN) was customized for cross-scanner and cross-tracer optimization. Three nuclear medicine physicians independently assessed the utility of the results in a clinical setting.

Results: The improvement achieved by AI recovery significantly correlated with the baseline image quality indicated by structural similarity index measurement (SSIM) (r = -0.71, p < 0.05) and normalized dose acquisition (r = -0.60, p < 0.05). Our cross-scanner and cross-tracer AI methodology showed utility based on both physical and clinical image assessment (p < 0.05).

Conclusion: The deep learning development for extensible application on unknown scanners and tracers may improve the trustworthiness and clinical acceptability of AI-based dose reduction.

TITLE: Multi-slice representational learning of convolutional neural network for Alzheimer's disease classification using positron emission tomography

AUTHORS: Han Woong Kim, Ha Eun Lee, KyeongTaek Oh, Sangwon Lee, Mijin Yun, Sun K Yoo

JOURNAL: Biomedical engineering online

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Background: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a degenerative brain disorder that often occurs in people over 65 years old. As advanced AD is difficult to manage, accurate diagnosis of the disorder is critical. Previous studies have revealed effective deep learning methods of classification. However, deep learning methods require a large number of image datasets. Moreover, medical images are affected by various environmental factors. In the current study, we propose a deep learning-based method for diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) that is less sensitive to different datasets for external validation, based upon F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT).

Results: The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of our proposed network were 86.09%, 80.00%, and 92.96% (respectively) using our dataset, and 91.02%, 87.93%, and 93.57% (respectively) using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. We observed that our model classified AD and normal cognitive (NC) cases based on the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), where pathological changes occur in AD. The performance of the GAP layer was considered statistically significant compared to the fully connected layer in both datasets for accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity (p < 0.01). In addition, performance comparison between the ADNI dataset and our dataset showed no statistically significant differences in accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity (p > 0.05).

Conclusions: The proposed model demonstrated the effectiveness of AD classification using the GAP layer. Our model learned the AD features from PCC in both the ADNI and Severance datasets, which can be seen in the heatmap. Furthermore, we showed that there were no significant differences in performance using statistical analysis.

AUTHORS: Ganna Blazhenets, Lars Frings, Arnd Sörensen, Philipp T Meyer, Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Voxel-based principal-component analysis allows for an identification of patterns of glucose metabolism and amyloid deposition related to the conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer disease (AD). The present study aimed to validate these AD conversion-related patterns (ADCRPs) against neuropathologic findings.Methods:We included patients from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative who underwent autopsy and for whom18F-FDG PET (30 AD, 6 MCI, 2 cognitively normal) and amyloid-β (Aβ) PET (17 AD, 3 MCI, 2 cognitively normal) were available. Pattern expression scores (PESs) of the18F-FDG- and Aβ-ADCRP were compared with Braak tangle stage and Thal amyloid phase, respectively. Mean18F-FDG uptake and mean18F-AV-45 SUV ratio (SUVr) in regions of hypometabolism and elevated amyloid load typical of AD, respectively, were used as volume-of-interest-based PET measures. The diagnostic performance for identifying none-to-low vs. intermediate-to-high AD neuropathologic change (ADNC) was assessed for all biomarkers.Results:We observed significant associations between PES of18F-FDG-ADCRP and Braak stage (ρ > 0.48,P< 0.005) and between PES of Aβ-ADCRP and Thal phase (ρ > 0.66,P< 0.001). PES of18F-FDG-ADCRP, PES of Aβ-ADCRP, and their combination identified intermediate-to-high ADNC with an area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.80, 0.95, and 0.98 (n= 22), respectively. Mean18F-FDG uptake and mean18F-AV-45 SUVr in AD-typical regions were also significantly associated with Braak stage (|ρ| > 0.45,P< 0.01) and Thal phase (ρ > 0.55,P< 0.01), respectively. Volume-of-interest-based PET measures discriminated between ADNC stages with an AUC of 0.79, 0.88, and 0.90 for mean18F-FDG uptake, mean18F-AV-45 SUVr, and their combination (n= 22), respectively. Contemplating all subjects with available18F-FDG PET and neuropathology information (n= 38), PES of18F-FDG-ADCRP was a significant predictor of intermediate-to-high ADNC (AUC = 0.72), whereas mean18F-FDG uptake was not (AUC = 0.66), although the difference between methods was not significant.Conclusion:PES of18F-FDG-ADCRP, a measure of neurodegeneration, shows close correspondence with the extent of tau pathology, as assessed by Braak tangle stage. PES of Aβ-ADCRP is a valid biomarker of underlying amyloid pathology, as demonstrated by its strong correlation with Thal phase. The combination of ADCRPs performed better than18F-FDG-ADCRP alone, although there was only negligible improvement compared with Aβ-ADCRP.

TITLE: Spatial adaptive and transformer fusion network (STFNet) for low-count PET blind denoising with MRI

AUTHORS: Lipei Zhang, Zizheng Xiao, Chao Zhou, Jianmin Yuan, Qiang He, Yongfeng Yang, Xin Liu, Dong Liang, Hairong Zheng, Wei Fan, Xu Zhang, Zhanli Hu

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Positron emission tomography (PET) has been widely used in various clinical applications. PET is a type of emission computed tomography and operates by positron annihilation radiation. With magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) providing anatomical information, joint PET/MRI reduces the radiation exposure risk of patients. Improved hardware and imaging algorithms have been proposed to further decrease the dose from radioactive tracers or the bed duration, but few methods focus on denoising low-count PET with MRI input. The existing methods are based on fixed conventional convolution and local attention, which do not sufficiently extract and fuse contextual and complementary information from multimodal input. There is still much room for improvement. Therefore, we propose a novel deep learning method for low-count PET/MRI denoising called the spatial-adaptive and transformer fusion network (STFNet), which consists of a Siamese encoder with a spatial-adaptive block (SA-block) and the transformer fusion encoder (TFE).

Methods: Our proposed STFNet consists of a Siamese encoder with an SA-block, TFE, and two branches of the decoder. First, in the encoder, we adapt the SA-block in the Siamese encoder. The SA-block comprises deformable convolution with fusion modulation (DCFM) and two convolutional operations, which can promote network extraction of more relative and long-range contextual features. Second, the pixel-to-pixel TFE helps the network establish a local and global relationship between high-level feature maps of PET and MRI. In the decoder part, we design two branches for PET denoising and MRI translation, and predictions are obtained by trainable weighted summation. This proposed algorithm is implemented to predict synthetic standard-dose neck PET images from low-count neck PET images and MRI. Additionally, this method is compared with the existing U-Net and residual U-Net methods with and without MRI input.

Results: To demonstrate the advantages of our method, we introduce configuration studies about TFE, ablation studies, and empirical comparative studies. Quantitative analyses are based on root mean square error (RSME), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity (SSIM), and Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC). Additionally, qualitative results show the comparisons between our proposed method and other existing methods. All experimental results and visualizations show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in quantification and qualification.

Conclusions: Based on our experiments, STFNet performs better than existing methods in measurement and visualization. However, our proposed method may still be suboptimal because we apply only the L1 loss to train our data set, and the data set includes corrupted PET with different low counts. In the future, we may exploit a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based paradigm in our STFNet to further improve the visual quality.

ABSTRACT:
With the evolution of deep learning technologies, computer vision-related tasks achieved tremendous success in the biomedical domain. For supervised deep learning training, we need a large number of labeled datasets. The task of achieving a large number of label dataset is a challenging. The availability of data makes it difficult to achieve and enhance an automated disease diagnosis model's performance. To synthesize data and improve the disease diagnosis model's accuracy, we proposed a novel approach for the generation of images for three different stages of Alzheimer's disease using deep convolutional generative adversarial networks. The proposed model out-perform in synthesis of brain positron emission tomography images for all three stages of Alzheimer disease. The three-stage of Alzheimer's disease is normal control, mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer's disease. The model performance is measured using a classification model that achieved an accuracy of 72% against synthetic images. We also experimented with quantitative measures, that is, peak signal-to-noise (PSNR) and structural similarity index measure (SSIM). We achieved average PSNR score values of 82 for AD, 72 for CN, and 73 for MCI and SSIM average score values of 25.6 for AD, 22.6 for CN, and 22.8 for MCI.

AUTHORS: Ahmadreza Rezaei, Matthew Spangler-Bickell, Georg Schramm, Koen Van Laere, Johan Nuyts, Michel Defrise

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
A data-driven method is proposed for rigid motion estimation directly from time-of-flight (TOF)-positron emission tomography (PET) emission data. Rigid motion parameters (translations and rotations) are estimated from the first and second moments of the emission data masked in a spherical volume. The accuracy of the method is analyzed on 3D analytical simulations of the PET-SORTEO brain phantom, and subsequently tested on18F-FDG as well as11C-PIB brain datasets acquired on a TOF-PET/CT scanner. The estimated inertia-based motion is later compared to rigid motion parameters obtained by directly registering the short frame backprojections. We find that the method provides sub mm/degree accuracies for the estimated rigid motion parameters for counts corresponding to typical 0.5 s, 1 s, and 2 s18F-FDG brain scans, with the current TOF resolutions clinically available. The method provides robust motion estimation for different types of patient motion, most notably for a continuous patient motion case where conventional frame-based approaches which rely on little to no intra-frame motion of short time intervals could fail. The method relies on the detection of stable eigenvectors for accurate motion estimation, and a monitoring of this condition can reveal time-frames where the motion estimation is less accurate, such as in dynamic PET studies.

JOURNAL: Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Positron emission tomography (PET) is a functional non-invasive imaging modality that uses radioactive substances (radiotracers) to measure changes in metabolic processes. Advances in scanner technology and data acquisition in the last decade have led to the development of more sophisticated PET devices with good spatial resolution (1-3 mm of full width at half maximum (FWHM)). However, there are involuntary motions produced by the patient inside the scanner that lead to image degradation and potentially to a misdiagnosis. The adverse effect of the motion in the reconstructed image increases as the spatial resolution of the current scanners continues improving. In order to correct this effect, motion correction techniques are becoming increasingly popular and further studied. This work presents a simulation study of an image motion correction using a frame-based algorithm. The method is able to cut the acquired data from the scanner in frames, taking into account the size of the object of study. This approach allows working with low statistical information without losing image quality. The frames are later registered using spatio-temporal registration developed in a multi-level way. To validate these results, several performance tests are applied to a set of simulated moving phantoms. The results obtained show that the method minimizes the intra-frame motion, improves the signal intensity over the background in comparison with other literature methods, produces excellent values of similarity with the ground-truth (static) image and is able to find a limit in the patient-injected dose when some prior knowledge of the lesion is present.

JOURNAL: Annals of nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Objective: Centiloid (CL) scales play an important role in semiquantitative analyses of amyloid-β (Aβ) PET. CLs are derived from the standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR), which needs Aβ positron emission tomography (PET) normalization processing. There are two methods to collect the T1-weighted imaging (T1WI) for normalization: (i) anatomical standardization using simultaneously acquired T1WI (PET/MRI), usually adapted to PET images from PET/MRI scanners, and (ii) T1WI from a separate examination (PET + MRI), usually adapted to PET images from PET/CT scanners. This study aimed to elucidate the correlations and differences in CLs between when using the above two T1WI collection methods.

Methods: Among patients who underwent Aβ PET/MRI (using11C-Pittuberg compound B (11C-PiB) or18F-flutemetamol (18F-FMM)) at our institution from 2015 to 2023, we selected 49 patients who also underwent other additional MRI examinations, including T1WI for anatomic standardization within 3 years. Thirty-one of them underwent11C-PiB PET/MRI, and 18 participants underwent18F-FMM PET/MRI. Twenty-five of them, additional MRI acquisition parameters were identical to simultaneous MRI during PET, and 24 participants were different. After normalization using PET/MRI or PET + MRI method each, SUVR was measured using the Global Alzheimer's Association Initiative Network cerebral cortical and striatum Volume of Interest templates (VOI) and whole cerebellum VOI. Subsequently, CLs were calculated using the previously established equations for each Aβ PET tracer.

Results: Between PET/MRI and PET + MRI methods, CLs correlated linearly in11C-PiB PET (y = 1.00x - 0.11, R2= 0.999),18F-FMM PET (y = 0.97x - 0.12, 0.997), identical additional MRI acquisition (y = 1.00x + 0.33, 0.999), different acquisition (y = 0.98x - 0.43, 0.997), and entire study group (y = 1.00x - 0.24, 0.999). Wilcoxon signed-rank test revealed no significant differences:11C-PiB (p = 0.49),18F-FMM (0.08), and whole PET (0.46). However, significant differences were identified in identical acquisition (p = 0.04) and different acquisition (p = 0.02). Bland-Altman analysis documented only a small bias between PET/MRI and PET + MRI in11C-PiB PET,18F-FMM PET, identical additional MRI acquisition, different acquisition, and whole PET (- 0.05, 0.67, - 0.30, 0.78, and 0.21, respectively).

Conclusions: Anatomical standardizations using PET/MRI and using PET + MRI can lead to almost equivalent CL. The CL values obtained using PET/MRI or PET + MRI normalization methods are consistent and comparable in clinical studies.

TITLE: Numerical investigation reveals challenges in measuring the contrast recovery coefficients in PET

AUTHORS: Reimund Bayerlein, Benjamin A Spencer, Yasser G Abdelhafez, Simon R Cherry, Ramsey D Badawi, Negar Omidvari

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Objective.Contrast recovery coefficient (CRC) is essential for image quality (IQ) assessment in positron emission tomography (PET), typically measured according to the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) NU 2 standard. This study quantifies systematic uncertainties of the CRC measurement by a numerical investigation of the effects from scanner-independent parameters like voxel size, region-of-interest (ROI) misplacement, and sphere position on the underlying image grid.Approach.CRC measurements with 2D and 3D ROIs were performed on computer-generated images of a NEMA IQ-like phantom, using voxel sizes of 1-4 mm for sphere diameters of 5-40 mm-first in absence of noise and blurring, then with simulated spatial resolution and image noise with varying noise levels. The systematic uncertainties of the CRC measurement were quantified from above variations of scanner-independent parameters. Subsampled experimental images of a NEMA IQ phantom were additionally used to investigate the impact of ROI misplacement at different noise levels.Main results.In absence of noise and blurring, systematic uncertainties were up to 28.8% and 31.0% with 2D and 3D ROIs, respectively, for the 10 mm sphere, with the highest impact from ROI misplacement. In all cases, smaller spheres showed higher uncertainties with larger voxels. Contrary to prior assumptions, the use of 3D ROIs did not exhibit less susceptibility for parameter changes. Experimental and computer-generated images both demonstrated considerable variations on individual CRC measurements when background coefficient-of-variation exceeded 20%, despite negligible effects on mean CRC.Significance.This study underscores the effect of scanner-independent parameters on reliability, reproducibility, and comparability of CRC measurements. Our findings highlight the trade-off between the benefits of smaller voxel sizes and noise-induced CRC fluctuations, which is not considered in the current version of the NEMA IQ standards. The results furthermore warrant adjustments to the standard to accommodate the advances in sensitivity and spatial resolution of current-generation PET scanners.

TITLE: PSR-Nets: Deep neural networks with prior shift regularization for PET/CT based automatic, accurate, and calibrated whole-body lymphoma segmentation

AUTHORS: Meng Wang, Huiyan Jiang, Tianyu Shi, Zhiguo Wang, Jia Guo, Guoxiu Lu, Youchao Wang, Yu-Dong Yao

JOURNAL: Computers in biology and medicine

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Lymphoma is a type of lymphatic tissue originated cancer. Automatic and accurate lymphoma segmentation is critical for its diagnosis and prognosis yet challenging due to the severely class-imbalanced problem. Generally, deep neural networks trained with class-observation-frequency based re-weighting loss functions are used to address this problem. However, the majority class can be under-weighted by them, due to the existence of data overlap. Besides, they are more mis-calibrated. To resolve these, we propose a neural network with prior-shift regularization (PSR-Net), which comprises a UNet-like backbone with re-weighting loss functions, and a prior-shift regularization (PSR) module including a prior-shift layer (PSL), a regularizer generation layer (RGL), and an expected prediction confidence updating layer (EPCUL). We first propose a trainable expected prediction confidence (EPC) for each class. Periodically, PSL shifts a prior training dataset to a more informative dataset based on EPCs; RGL presents a generalized informative-voxel-aware (GIVA) loss with EPCs and calculates it on the informative dataset for model finetuning in back-propagation; and EPCUL updates EPCs to refresh PSL and RRL in next forward-propagation. PSR-Net is trained in a two- stage manner. The backbone is first trained with re-weighting loss functions, then we reload the best saved model for the backbone and continue to train it with the weighted sum of the re-weighting loss functions, the GIVA regularizer and the L2 loss function of EPCs for regularization fine-tuning. Extensive experiments are performed based on PET/CT volumes with advanced stage lymphomas. Our PSR-Net achieves 95.12% sensitivity and 87.18% Dice coefficient, demonstrating the effectiveness of PSR-Net, when compared to the baselines and the state-of-the-arts.

ABSTRACT:
Background: Accurate delineation of the clinical target volume (CTV) is essential in the radiotherapy treatment of soft tissue sarcomas. However, this process is subject to inter-reader variability due to the need for clinical assessment of risk and extent of potential microscopic spread. This can lead to inconsistencies in treatment planning, potentially impacting treatment outcomes. Most existing automatic CTV delineation methods do not account for this variability and can only generate a single CTV for each case.

Purpose: This study aims to develop a deep learning-based technique to generate multiple CTV contours for each case, simulating the inter-reader variability in the clinical practice.

Methods: We employed a publicly available dataset consisting of fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), x-ray computed tomography (CT), and pre-contrast T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans from 51 patients with soft tissue sarcoma, along with an independent validation set containing five additional patients. An experienced reader drew a contour of the gross tumor volume (GTV) for each patient based on multi-modality images. Subsequently, two additional readers, together with the first one, were responsible for contouring three CTVs in total based on the GTV. We developed a diffusion model-based deep learning method that is capable of generating arbitrary number of different and plausible CTVs to mimic the inter-reader variability in CTV delineation. The proposed model incorporates a separate encoder to extract features from the GTV masks, leveraging the critical role of GTV information in accurate CTV delineation.

Results: The proposed diffusion model demonstrated superior performance with the highest Dice Index (0.902 compared to values below 0.881 for state-of-the-art models) and the best generalized energy distance (GED) (0.209 compared to values exceeding 0.221 for state-of-the-art models). It also achieved the second-highest recall and precision metrics among the compared ambiguous image segmentation models. Results from both datasets exhibited consistent trends, reinforcing the reliability of our findings. Additionally, ablation studies exploring different model structures and input configurations highlighted the significance of incorporating prior GTV information for accurate CTV delineation.

Conclusions: The proposed diffusion model successfully generates multiple plausible CTV contours for soft tissue sarcomas, effectively capturing inter-reader variability in CTV delineation.

TITLE: Recurrent feature fusion learning for multi-modality pet-ct tumor segmentation

AUTHORS: Lei Bi, Michael Fulham, Nan Li, Qiufang Liu, Shaoli Song, David Dagan Feng, Jinman Kim

JOURNAL: Computer methods and programs in biomedicine

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Background and objective: [18f]-fluorodeoxyglucose (fdg) positron emission tomography - computed tomography (pet-ct) is now the preferred imaging modality for staging many cancers. Pet images characterize tumoral glucose metabolism while ct depicts the complementary anatomical localization of the tumor. Automatic tumor segmentation is an important step in image analysis in computer aided diagnosis systems. Recently, fully convolutional networks (fcns), with their ability to leverage annotated datasets and extract image feature representations, have become the state-of-the-art in tumor segmentation. There are limited fcn based methods that support multi-modality images and current methods have primarily focused on the fusion of multi-modality image features at various stages, i.e., early-fusion where the multi-modality image features are fused prior to fcn, late-fusion with the resultant features fused and hyper-fusion where multi-modality image features are fused across multiple image feature scales. Early- and late-fusion methods, however, have inherent, limited freedom to fuse complementary multi-modality image features. The hyper-fusion methods learn different image features across different image feature scales that can result in inaccurate segmentations, in particular, in situations where the tumors have heterogeneous textures.

Methods: we propose a recurrent fusion network (rfn), which consists of multiple recurrent fusion phases to progressively fuse the complementary multi-modality image features with intermediary segmentation results derived at individual recurrent fusion phases: (1) the recurrent fusion phases iteratively learn the image features and then refine the subsequent segmentation results; and, (2) the intermediary segmentation results allows our method to focus on learning the multi-modality image features around these intermediary segmentation results, which minimize the risk of inconsistent feature learning.

Results: we evaluated our method on two pathologically proven non-small cell lung cancer pet-ct datasets. We compared our method to the commonly used fusion methods (early-fusion, late-fusion and hyper-fusion) and the state-of-the-art pet-ct tumor segmentation methods on various network backbones (resnet, densenet and 3d-unet). Our results show that the rfn provides more accurate segmentation compared to the existing methods and is generalizable to different datasets.

Conclusions: we show that learning through multiple recurrent fusion phases allows the iterative re-use of multi-modality image features that refines tumor segmentation results. We also identify that our rfn produces consistent segmentation results across different network architectures.

TITLE: PET radiomics for histologic subtype classification of non-small cell lung cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis

AUTHORS: Jucheng Zhang, Xiaohui Zhang, Yan Zhong, Jing Wang, Chao Zhong, Meiling Xiao, Yuhan Chen, Hong Zhang

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: To systematically review the literature and perform a meta-analysis of PET radiomics for histologic subtype classification in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

Methods: PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were systematically searched in English on human subjects for studies on distinguishing adenocarcinoma (ADC) from squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) using PET radiomics published from inception until November 2024. The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 (QUADAS-2) tool and the Radiomics Quality Score (RQS) were utilized to assess the methodological quality of the included studies. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) was pooled to estimate predictive performance. An overall effect size was estimated using a random-effects model. Statistical heterogeneity was evaluated by the I2value. Subgroup analyses were conducted to explore sources of heterogeneity.

Results: Twelve studies were included in the analysis, yielding a pooled AUC of 0.92 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.89-0.94). Despite this promising result, the studies showed limitations in both study design and methodological quality, as evidenced by a median RQS of 11/36. A significant degree of heterogeneity was observed among the studies, with an I2of 92.20% (95% CI: 89.01-95.39) for sensitivity and 89.29% (95% CI: 84.48-94.10) for specificity.

Conclusions: This meta-analysis highlights the potential utility of PET radiomics in distinguishing ADC from SCC. However, the observed high heterogeneity indicates substantial methodological variability across the included studies. Future research should focus on standardization, transparency, and multicenter collaborations to improve the reliability and clinical applicability of PET radiomics for histologic subtype classification in NSCLC.

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
The goal of this study was to conduct an external, independent validation of anO-(2-[18F]fluoroethyl)-l-tyrosine ([18F]FET) PET automatic segmentation network on a cohort of patients with glioblastoma.Methods:Twenty-four patients with glioblastoma were included in this study who underwent a total of 52 [18F]FET PET scans (preradiotherapy,n= 23; preradiotherapy retest,n= 9; follow-up,n= 20). Biologic tumor volume (BTV) delineation was performed by an expert nuclear medicine physician and an automatic segmentation network. Physician and automated quantitative metrics (BTV, mean tumor-to-background ratio [TBRmean], lesion SUVmean, and background SUVmean) were assessed with Pearson correlation and Bland-Altman analysis (bias, limits of agreement [LoA]). Automated and physician segmentation overlap was assessed with spatial and distance-based metrics.Results:BTV and TBRmeanPearson correlation was excellent for all time points (range, 0.92-0.98). In 2 patients with frontal lobe lesions, the network segmented the transverse sinus. Bland-Altman analysis showed network underestimation of physician-derived BTVs (absolute bias, 2.7 cm3, LoA, -13.1-18.5 cm3; relative bias, 27.9%, LoA, -95.3%-151.2%) and deviations for TBRmeanwere small (absolute bias, 0.03, LoA, -0.25-0.30; relative bias, 0.83%, LoA -14.27%-15.93%). Median Dice similarity coefficient, surface Dice similarity coefficient, Hausdorff distance, 95th percentile Hausdorff distance, and mean absolute surface distance were 0.83, 0.95, 10.94 mm, 3.62 mm, and 0.88 mm, respectively.Conclusion:Automated quantitative analysis was highly correlated with physician assessment; however, volume underestimation and erroneous segmentations may impact radiotherapy treatment planning and response assessment. Further training on a representative local dataset would likely be required for multicenter implementation.

TITLE: Almost 10 years of PET/MR attenuation correction: the effect on lesion quantification with PSMA: clinical evaluation on 200 prostate cancer patients

AUTHORS: Borjana Bogdanovic, Andrei Gafita, Sylvia Schachoff, Matthias Eiber, Jorge Cabello, Wolfgang A Weber, Stephan G Nekolla

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: After a decade of PET/MR, the case of attenuation correction (AC) remains open. The initial four-compartment (air, water, fat, soft tissue) Dixon-based AC scheme has since been expanded with several features, the latest being MR field-of-view extension and a bone atlas. As this potentially changes quantification, we evaluated the impact of these features in PET AC in prostate cancer patients.

Methods: Two hundred prostate cancer patients were examined with either18F- or68Ga-prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET/MR. Qualitative and quantitative analysis (SUVmean, SUVmax, correlation, and statistical significance) was performed on images reconstructed using different AC schemes: Dixon, Dixon+MLAA, Dixon+HUGE, and Dixon+HUGE+bones for18F-PSMA data; Dixon and Dixon+bones for68Ga-PSMA data. Uptakes were compared using linear regression against standard Dixon.

Results: High correlation and no visually perceivable differences between all evaluated methods (r > 0.996) were found. The mean relative difference in lesion uptake of18F-PSMA and68Ga-PSMA remained, respectively, within 4% and 3% in soft tissue, and within 10% and 9% in bones for all evaluated methods. Bone registration errors were detected, causing mean uptake change of 5% in affected lesions.

Conclusions: Based on these results and the encountered bone atlas registration inaccuracy, we deduce that including bones and extending the MR field-of-view did not introduce clinically significant differences in PSMA diagnostic accuracy and tracer uptake quantification in prostate cancer pelvic lesions, facilitating the analysis of serial studies respectively. However, in the absence of ground truth data, we advise against atlas-based methods when comparing serial scans for bone lesions.

TITLE: Dynamic cardiac PET motion correction using 3D normalized gradient fields in patients and phantom simulations

AUTHORS: Jonathon A Nye, Marina Piccinelli, Doyeon Hwang, Charles David Cooke, Jin Chul Paeng, Joo Myung Lee, Sang-Geon Cho, Russell Folks, Hee-Seung Bom, Bon-Kwon Koo, Ernest V Garcia

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
This work expands on the implementation of three-dimensional (3D) normalized gradient fields to correct for whole-body motion and cardiac creep in [N-13]-ammonia patient studies and evaluates its accuracy using a dynamic phantom simulation model.

Methods: A full rigid-body algorithm was developed using 3D normalized gradient fields including a multi-resolution step and sampling off the voxel grid to reduce interpolation artifacts. Optimization was performed using a weighted similarity metric that accounts for opposing gradients between images of blood pool and perfused tissue without the need for segmentation. Forty-three retrospective dynamic [N-13]-ammonia PET/CT rest/adenosine-stress patient studies were motion corrected and the mean motion parameters plotted at each frame time point. Motion correction accuracy was assessed using a comprehensive dynamic XCAT simulation incorporating published physiologic parameters of the heart's trajectory following adenosine infusion as well as corrupted attenuation correction commonly observed in clinical studies. Accuracy of the algorithm was assessed objectively by comparing the errors between isosurfaces and centers of mass of the motion corrected XCAT simulations.

Results: In the patient studies, the overall mean cranial-to-caudal translation was 7 mm at stress over the duration of the adenosine infusion. Noninvasive clinical measures of relative flow reserve and myocardial flow reserve were highly correlated with their invasive analogues. Motion correction accuracy assessed with the XCAT simulations showed an error of <1 mm in late perfusion frames that broadened gradually to <3 mm in earlier frames containing blood pool.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates that patients undergoing [N-13]-ammonia dynamic PET/CT exhibit a large cranial-to-caudal translation related to cardiac creep primarily at stress and to a lesser extent at rest, which can be accurately corrected by optimizing their 3D normalized gradient fields. Our approach provides a solution to the challenging condition where the image intensity and its gradients are opposed without the need for segmentation and remains robust in the presence of PET-CT mismatch.

TITLE: LSAM: L2-norm self-attention and latent space feature interaction for automatic 3D multi-modal head and neck tumor segmentation

AUTHORS: Laquan Li, Jiaxin Tan, Lei Yu, Chunwen Li, Hai Nan, Shenhai Zheng

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Objective.Head and neck (H&N) cancers are prevalent globally, and early and accurate detection is absolutely crucial for timely and effective treatment. However, the segmentation of H&N tumors is challenging due to the similar density of the tumors and surrounding tissues in CT images. While positron emission computed tomography (PET) images provide information about the metabolic activity of the tissue and can distinguish between lesion regions and normal tissue. But they are limited by their low spatial resolution. To fully leverage the complementary information from PET and CT images, we propose a novel and innovative multi-modal tumor segmentation method specifically designed for H&N tumor segmentation.Approach.The proposed novel and innovative multi-modal tumor segmentation network (LSAM) consists of two key learning modules, namely L2-Norm self-attention and latent space feature interaction, which exploit the high sensitivity of PET images and the anatomical information of CT images. These two advanced modules contribute to a powerful 3D segmentation network based on a U-shaped structure. The well-designed segmentation method can integrate complementary features from different modalities at multiple scales, thereby improving the feature interaction between modalities.Main results.We evaluated the proposed method on the public HECKTOR PET-CT dataset, and the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method convincingly outperforms existing H&N tumor segmentation methods in terms of key evaluation metrics, including DSC (0.8457), Jaccard (0.7756), RVD (0.0938), and HD95 (11.75).Significance.The innovative Self-Attention mechanism based on L2-Norm offers scalability and is effective in reducing the impact of outliers on the performance of the model. And the novel method for multi-scale feature interaction based on Latent Space utilizes the learning process in the encoder phase to achieve the best complementary effects among different modalities.

TITLE: A detector block-pairwise dead time correction method for improved quantitation with a dedicated BrainPET scanner

AUTHORS: Ahlam Said Mohamad Issa, Jürgen Scheins, Lutz Tellmann, Alejandro Lopez-Montes, Joaquin L Herraiz, Cláudia Régio Brambilla, Hans Herzog, Irene Neuner, N Jon Shah, Christoph Lerche

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
'Objective. Dead time correction (DTC) is an important factor in ensuring accurate quantification in PET measurements. This is currently often achieved using a global DTC method, i.e., an average DTC factor is computed. For PET scanners designed to image dedicated organs, e.g., those used in brain imaging or positron emission mammography (PEM), a substantial amount of the administered radioactivity is located outside of the PET field-of-view (FOV). This activity contributes to the dead time (DT) of the scintillation detectors. Moreover, the count rates of the individual scintillation detectors are potentially very inhomogeneous due to the specific irradiation of each detector, especially for combined MR/PET systems, where radiation shields cannot be applied. Approach: We have developed a block-pairwise DTC method for our Siemens 3T MR BrainPET insert by extending a previously published method that uses the delayed random coincidence count rate to estimate the DT in the individual scans and planes (i.e., scintillation pixel rings). The method was validated in decay experiments using phantoms with a homogenous activity concentration and with and without out-of-FOV activity. Based on a three-compartment phantom, we compared the accuracy and noise properties of the block-pairwise DTC and the global DTC method.Main results. The currently used global DTC led to a substantial positive bias in regions with high activity; the block-pairwise DTC resulted in substantially less bias. The noise level for the block-pairwise DTC was comparable to the global DTC and image reconstructions without any DTC. Finally, we tested the block-pairwise DTC with a data set obtained from volunteer measurements using the mGluR5 (metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5) antagonist [11C]ABP688. When the relative differences in activity concentrations obtained with global DTC and block-pairwise DTC for the ACC and the cerebellum GM were compared, the ratios differed by a factor of up to 1.4 at the beginning-when the first injection is administered as a bolus with high radioactivity.Significance. In this work, global DTC was shown to have the potential to introduce quantification bias, while better quantitation accuracy was achieved with the presented block-pairwise DTC method. The method can be implemented in all systems that use the delayed window technique and is particulary expected to improve the quantiation accuracy of dedicated brain PET scanners due to their geometry.'

TITLE: Coronary artery calcium measurement on attenuation correction computed tomography using artificial intelligence: correlation with coronary flow capacity and prognosis

AUTHORS: Sang-Geon Cho, Jong Eun Lee, Kyung Hoon Cho, Ki-Seong Park, Jahae Kim, Jang Bae Moon, Kang Bin Kim, Ju Han Kim, Ho-Chun Song

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: This study aimed to test whether the coronary artery calcium (CAC) burden on attenuation correction computed tomography (CTac), measured using artificial intelligence (AI-CACac), correlates with coronary flow capacity (CFC) and prognosis.

Materials and methods: We retrospectively enrolled patients who underwent [13N]ammonia positron emission tomography (PET) between September 2021 and May 2023. CTac data were obtained from all the patients. Patients with (history of) acute coronary syndrome, previous coronary stent insertion or bypass surgery, or left ventricular ejection fraction < 40% were excluded. The total Agatston score measured using a dedicated AI-CAC quantification software on CTac was defined as AI-CACac. The correlations between AI-CACac and PET-measured myocardial blood flow (MBF) and CFC and significant ischaemia (summed difference score ≥ 7) were analysed. Their prognostic values for major cardiovascular events (MACE), including death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, hospitalisation due to angina pectoris or heart failure, and late (> 90 days) revascularisation, were also evaluated.

Results: In total, 289 patients were included in this study. Significant negative correlations were found between AI-CACac and stress MBF (ρ = -0.363, p < 0.001) and MFR (ρ = -0.305, p < 0.001). AI-CACac > 10 was associated with a significantly higher prevalence of impaired CFC (31% vs. 7%, p < 0.001) and significant ischaemia (20% vs. 7%), which remained significant after adjusting for other risk factors. MACE occurred in 49 (17%) patients (median follow-up, 284 days), and those who experienced MACE had significantly higher AI-CACac (median, 166 vs. 56; p = 0.039). However, multivariable analysis revealed an independent prognostic association among impaired CFC, diabetes, smoking, but not for AI-CACac.

Conclusion: AI-measured CACac correlates well with PET-measured MBF and CFC, but its prognostic significance requires further validation.

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Dopamine transporter imaging is routinely used in Parkinson's disease (PD) and atypical parkinsonian syndromes (APS) diagnosis. While [11C]CFT PET is prevalent in Asia with a large APS database, Europe relies on [123I]FP-CIT SPECT with limited APS data. Our aim was to develop a deep learning-based method to convert [11C]CFT PET images to [123I]FP-CIT SPECT images, facilitating multicenter studies and overcoming data scarcity to promote Artificial Intelligence (AI) advancements.

Methods: A CycleGAN was trained on [11C]CFT PET (n = 602, 72%PD) and [123I]FP-CIT SPECT (n = 1152, 85%PD) images from PD and non-parkinsonian control (NC) subjects. The model generated synthetic SPECT images from a real PET test set (n = 67, 75%PD). Synthetic images were quantitatively and visually evaluated.

Results: Fréchet Inception Distance indicated higher similarity between synthetic and real SPECT than between synthetic SPECT and real PET. A deep learning classification model trained on synthetic SPECT achieved sensitivity of 97.2% and specificity of 90.0% on real SPECT images. Striatal specific binding ratios of synthetic SPECT were not significantly different from real SPECT. The striatal left-right differences and putamen binding ratio were significantly different only in the PD cohort. Real PET and real SPECT had higher contrast-to-noise ratio compared to synthetic SPECT. Visual grading analysis scores showed no significant differences between real and synthetic SPECT, although reduced diagnostic performance on synthetic images was observed.

Conclusion: CycleGAN generated synthetic SPECT images visually indistinguishable from real ones and retained disease-specific information, demonstrating the feasibility of translating [11C]CFT PET to [123I]FP-CIT SPECT. This cross-modality synthesis could enhance further AI classification accuracy, supporting the diagnosis of PD and APS.

TITLE: Fully Automated Gross Tumor Volume Delineation From PET in Head and Neck Cancer Using Deep Learning Algorithms

AUTHORS: Isaac Shiri, Hossein Arabi, Amirhossein Sanaat, Elnaz Jenabi, Minerva Becker, Habib Zaidi

JOURNAL: Clinical nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: The availability of automated, accurate, and robust gross tumor volume (GTV) segmentation algorithms is critical for the management of head and neck cancer (HNC) patients. In this work, we evaluated 3 state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms combined with 8 different loss functions for PET image segmentation using a comprehensive training set and evaluated its performance on an external validation set of HNC patients.

Patients and methods: 18F-FDG PET/CT images of 470 patients presenting with HNC on which manually defined GTVs serving as standard of reference were used for training (340 patients), evaluation (30 patients), and testing (100 patients from different centers) of these algorithms. PET image intensity was converted to SUVs and normalized in the range (0-1) using the SUVmax of the whole data set. PET images were cropped to 12 × 12 × 12 cm3 subvolumes using isotropic voxel spacing of 3 × 3 × 3 mm3 containing the whole tumor and neighboring background including lymph nodes. We used different approaches for data augmentation, including rotation (-15 degrees, +15 degrees), scaling (-20%, 20%), random flipping (3 axes), and elastic deformation (sigma = 1 and proportion to deform = 0.7) to increase the number of training sets. Three state-of-the-art networks, including Dense-VNet, NN-UNet, and Res-Net, with 8 different loss functions, including Dice, generalized Wasserstein Dice loss, Dice plus XEnt loss, generalized Dice loss, cross-entropy, sensitivity-specificity, and Tversky, were used. Overall, 28 different networks were built. Standard image segmentation metrics, including Dice similarity, image-derived PET metrics, first-order, and shape radiomic features, were used for performance assessment of these algorithms.

Results: The best results in terms of Dice coefficient (mean ± SD) were achieved by cross-entropy for Res-Net (0.86 ± 0.05; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.85-0.87), Dense-VNet (0.85 ± 0.058; 95% CI, 0.84-0.86), and Dice plus XEnt for NN-UNet (0.87 ± 0.05; 95% CI, 0.86-0.88). The difference between the 3 networks was not statistically significant (P > 0.05). The percent relative error (RE%) of SUVmax quantification was less than 5% in networks with a Dice coefficient more than 0.84, whereas a lower RE% (0.41%) was achieved by Res-Net with cross-entropy loss. For maximum 3-dimensional diameter and sphericity shape features, all networks achieved a RE ≤ 5% and ≤10%, respectively, reflecting a small variability.

Conclusions: Deep learning algorithms exhibited promising performance for automated GTV delineation on HNC PET images. Different loss functions performed competitively when using different networks and cross-entropy for Res-Net, Dense-VNet, and Dice plus XEnt for NN-UNet emerged as reliable networks for GTV delineation. Caution should be exercised for clinical deployment owing to the occurrence of outliers in deep learning-based algorithms.

TITLE: HybraPD atlas: Towards precise subcortical nuclei segmentation using multimodality medical images in patients with Parkinson disease

AUTHORS: Boliang Yu, Ling Li, Xiaojun Guan, Xiaojun Xu, Xueling Liu, Qing Yang, Hongjiang Wei, Chuantao Zuo, Yuyao Zhang

JOURNAL: Human brain mapping

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Human brain atlases are essential for research and surgical treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). For example, deep brain stimulation for PD often requires human brain atlases for brain structure identification. However, few atlases can provide disease-specific subcortical structures for PD, and most of them are based on T1w and T2w images. In this work, we construct a HybraPD atlas using fused quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) and T1w images from 87 patients with PD. The constructed HybraPD atlas provides a series of templates, that is, T1w, GRE magnitude, QSM, R2*, and brain tissue probabilistic maps. Then, we manually delineate a parcellation map with 12 bilateral subcortical nuclei, which are highly related to PD pathology, such as sub-regions in globus pallidus and substantia nigra. Furthermore, we build a whole-brain parcellation map by combining existing cortical parcellation and white-matter segmentation with the proposed subcortical nuclei map. Considering the multimodality of the HybraPD atlas, the segmentation accuracy of each nucleus is evaluated using T1w and QSM templates, respectively. The results show that the HybraPD atlas provides more accurate segmentation than existing atlases. Moreover, we analyze the metabolic difference in subcortical nuclei between PD patients and healthy control subjects by applying the HybraPD atlas to calculate uptake values of contrast agents on positron emission tomography (PET) images. The atlas-based analysis generates accurate disease-related brain nuclei segmentation on PET images. The newly developed HybraPD atlas could serve as an efficient template to study brain pathological alterations in subcortical regions for PD research.

ABSTRACT:
Standardizing tumor measurement on18F-FDG PET is crucial for the routine clinical use of powerful PET-derived lymphoma prognostic factors such as metabolic tumor volume (MTV) and total lesion glycolysis (TLG). The recent proposal of an SUV of 4 as a new reference segmentation threshold for most aggressive lymphomas may homogenize volume-based metrics and facilitate their clinical application.Methods:This study compared MTV and TLG in primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL) patients estimated using an SUV of 4 and the current threshold at 25% of SUVmaxBaseline PET metrics were evaluated in 501 PMBCL patients from the IELSG37 trial.Results:Median MTV and TLG estimated with the 25% of SUVmaxthreshold were significantly lower than those obtained with the new reference threshold; however, an extremely high correlation was observed between the methods for both MTV (r= 0.95) and TLG (r= 0.99), resulting in superimposable prognostic power.Conclusion:These findings support the routine use of an SUV of 4 for volumetric measurements in PMBCL.

TITLE: Advancements in synthetic CT generation from MRI: A review of techniques, and trends in radiation therapy planning

AUTHORS: Mohamed A Bahloul, Saima Jabeen, Sara Benoumhani, Habib Abdulmohsen Alsaleh, Zehor Belkhatir, Areej Al-Wabil

JOURNAL: Journal of applied clinical medical physics

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Background: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and Computed tomography (CT) are crucial imaging techniques in both diagnostic imaging and radiation therapy. MRI provides excellent soft tissue contrast but lacks the direct electron density data needed to calculate dosage. CT, on the other hand, remains the gold standard due to its accurate electron density information in radiation therapy planning (RTP) but it exposes patients to ionizing radiation. Synthetic CT (sCT) generation from MRI has been a focused study field in the last few years due to cost effectiveness as well as for the objective of minimizing side-effects of using more than one imaging modality for treatment simulation. It offers significant time and cost efficiencies, bypassing the complexities of co-registration, and potentially improving treatment accuracy by minimizing registration-related errors. In an effort to navigate the quickly developing field of precision medicine, this paper investigates recent advancements in sCT generation techniques, particularly those using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL).

TITLE: Recent advances in medical image processing for the evaluation of chronic kidney disease

AUTHORS: Israa Alnazer, Pascal Bourdon, Thierry Urruty, Omar Falou, Mohamad Khalil, Ahmad Shahin, Christine Fernandez-Maloigne

JOURNAL: Medical image analysis

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Assessment of renal function and structure accurately remains essential in the diagnosis and prognosis of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). Advanced imaging, including Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Ultrasound Elastography (UE), Computed Tomography (CT) and scintigraphy (PET, SPECT) offers the opportunity to non-invasively retrieve structural, functional and molecular information that could detect changes in renal tissue properties and functionality. Currently, the ability of artificial intelligence to turn conventional medical imaging into a full-automated diagnostic tool is widely investigated. In addition to the qualitative analysis performed on renal medical imaging, texture analysis was integrated with machine learning techniques as a quantification of renal tissue heterogeneity, providing a promising complementary tool in renal function decline prediction. Interestingly, deep learning holds the ability to be a novel approach of renal function diagnosis. This paper proposes a survey that covers both qualitative and quantitative analysis applied to novel medical imaging techniques to monitor the decline of renal function. First, we summarize the use of different medical imaging modalities to monitor CKD and then, we show the ability of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to guide renal function evaluation from segmentation to disease prediction, discussing how texture analysis and machine learning techniques have emerged in recent clinical researches in order to improve renal dysfunction monitoring and prediction. The paper gives a summary about the role of AI in renal segmentation.

TITLE: Total-Body Quantitative Parametric Imaging of Early Kinetics of 18F-FDG

AUTHORS: Tao Feng, Yizhang Zhao, Hongcheng Shi, Hongdi Li, Xuezhu Zhang, Guobao Wang, Patricia M Price, Ramsey D Badawi, Simon R Cherry, Terry Jones

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Parametric imaging has been shown to provide better quantitation physiologically than SUV imaging in PET. With the increased sensitivity from a recently developed total-body PET scanner, whole-body scans with higher temporal resolution become possible for dynamic analysis and parametric imaging. In this paper, we focus on deriving the parameterk1using compartmental modeling and on developing a method to acquire whole-body18F-FDG PET parametric images using only the first 90 s of the postinjection scan data with the total-body PET system.Methods:Dynamic projections were acquired with a time interval of 1 s for the first 30 s and a time interval of 2 s for the following minute. Image-derived input functions were acquired from the reconstructed dynamic sequences in the ascending aorta. A 1-tissue-compartment model with 4 parameters (k1,k2, blood fraction, and delay time) was used. A maximum-likelihood-based estimation method was developed with the 1-tissue-compartment model solution. The accuracy of the acquired parameters was compared with the ones estimated using a 2-tissue-compartment irreversible model with 1-h-long data.Results:All 4 parametric images were successfully calculated using data from 2 volunteers. By comparing the time-activity curves acquired from the volumes of interest, we showed that the parameters estimated using our method were able to predict the time-activity curves of the early dynamics of18F-FDG in different organs. The delay-time effects for different organs were also clearly visible in the reconstructed delay-time image with delay variations of as large as 40 s. The estimated parameters using both 90-s data and 1-h data agreed well fork1and blood fraction, whereas a large difference ink2was found between the 90-s and 1-h data, suggestingk2cannot be reliably estimated from the 90-s scan.Conclusion:We have shown that with total-body PET and the increased sensitivity, it is possible to estimate parametric images based on the very early dynamics after18F-FDG injection. The estimatedk1might potentially be used clinically as an indicator for identifying abnormalities.

TITLE: Predicting PET-derived myelin content from multisequence MRI for individual longitudinal analysis in multiple sclerosis

AUTHORS: Wen Wei, Emilie Poirion, Benedetta Bodini, Matteo Tonietto, Stanley Durrleman, Olivier Colliot, Bruno Stankoff, Nicholas Ayache

JOURNAL: NeuroImage

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating and inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS). The demyelination process can be repaired by the generation of a new sheath of myelin around the axon, a process termed remyelination. In MS patients, the demyelination-remyelination cycles are highly dynamic. Over the years, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been increasingly used in the diagnosis of MS and it is currently the most useful paraclinical tool to assess this diagnosis. However, conventional MRI pulse sequences are not specific for pathological mechanisms such as demyelination and remyelination. Recently, positron emission tomography (PET) with radiotracer [11C]PIB has become a promising tool to measure in-vivo myelin content changes which is essential to push forward our understanding of mechanisms involved in the pathology of MS, and to monitor individual patients in the context of clinical trials focused on repair therapies. However, PET imaging is invasive due to the injection of a radioactive tracer. Moreover, it is an expensive imaging test and not offered in the majority of medical centers in the world. In this work, by using multisequence MRI, we thus propose a method to predict the parametric map of [11C]PIB PET, from which we derived the myelin content changes in a longitudinal analysis of patients with MS. The method is based on the proposed conditional flexible self-attention GAN (CF-SAGAN) which is specifically adjusted for high-dimensional medical images and able to capture the relationships between the spatially separated lesional regions during the image synthesis process. Jointly applying the sketch-refinement process and the proposed attention regularization that focuses on the MS lesions, our approach is shown to outperform the state-of-the-art methods qualitatively and quantitatively. Specifically, our method demonstrated a superior performance for the prediction of myelin content at voxel-wise level. More important, our method for the prediction of myelin content changes in patients with MS shows similar clinical correlations to the PET-derived gold standard indicating the potential for clinical management of patients with MS.

TITLE: TG-Net: Combining transformer and GAN for nasopharyngeal carcinoma tumor segmentation based on total-body uEXPLORER PET/CT scanner

AUTHORS: Zhengyong Huang, Si Tang, Zixiang Chen, Guoshuai Wang, Hao Shen, Yun Zhou, Haining Wang, Wei Fan, Dong Liang, Yingying Hu, Zhanli Hu

JOURNAL: Computers in biology and medicine

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a malignant tumor, and the main treatment is radiotherapy. Accurate delineation of the target tumor is essential for radiotherapy of NPC. NPC tumors are small in size and vary widely in shape and structure, making it a time-consuming and laborious task for even experienced radiologists to manually outline tumors. However, the segmentation performance of current deep learning models is not satisfactory, mainly manifested by poor segmentation boundaries. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a segmentation method for nasopharyngeal carcinoma based on dynamic PET-CT image data, whose input data include CT, PET, and parametric images (Ki images). This method uses a generative adversarial network with a modified UNet integrated with a Transformer as the generator (TG-Net) to achieve automatic segmentation of NPC on combined CT-PET-Ki images. In the coding stage, TG-Net uses moving windows to replace traditional pooling operations to obtain patches of different sizes, which can reduce information loss in the coding process. Moreover, the introduction of Transformer can make the network learn more representative features and improve the discriminant ability of the model, especially for tumor boundaries. Finally, the results of fivefold cross validation with an average Dice similarity coefficient score of 0.9135 show that our method has good segmentation performance. Comparative experiments also show that our network structure is superior to the most advanced methods in the segmentation of NPC. In addition, this work is the first to use Ki images to assist tumor segmentation. We also demonstrated the usefulness of adding Ki images to aid in tumor segmentation.

TITLE: DMCT-Net: dual modules convolution transformer network for head and neck tumor segmentation in PET/CT

AUTHORS: Jiao Wang, Yanjun Peng, Yanfei Guo

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Objective.Accurate segmentation of head and neck (H&N) tumors is critical in radiotherapy. However, the existing methods lack effective strategies to integrate local and global information, strong semantic information and context information, and spatial and channel features, which are effective clues to improve the accuracy of tumor segmentation. In this paper, we propose a novel method called dual modules convolution transformer network (DMCT-Net) for H&N tumor segmentation in the fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) images.Approach.The DMCT-Net consists of the convolution transformer block (CTB), the squeeze and excitation (SE) pool module, and the multi-attention fusion (MAF) module. First, the CTB is designed to capture the remote dependency and local multi-scale receptive field information by using the standard convolution, the dilated convolution, and the transformer operation. Second, to extract feature information from different angles, we construct the SE pool module, which not only extracts strong semantic features and context features simultaneously but also uses the SE normalization to adaptively fuse features and adjust feature distribution. Third, the MAF module is proposed to combine the global context information, channel information, and voxel-wise local spatial information. Besides, we adopt the up-sampling auxiliary paths to supplement the multi-scale information.Main results.The experimental results show that the method has better or more competitive segmentation performance than several advanced methods on three datasets. The best segmentation metric scores are as follows: DSC of 0.781, HD95 of 3.044, precision of 0.798, and sensitivity of 0.857. Comparative experiments based on bimodal and single modal indicate that bimodal input provides more sufficient and effective information for improving tumor segmentation performance. Ablation experiments verify the effectiveness and significance of each module.Significance.We propose a new network for 3D H&N tumor segmentation in FDG-PET/CT images, which achieves high accuracy.

TITLE: Comparison of quantitative [11C]PE2I brain PET studies between an integrated PET/MR and a stand-alone PET system

JOURNAL: Physica medica : PM : an international journal devoted to the applications of physics to medicine and biology : official journal of the Italian Association of Biomedical Physics (AIFB)

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
PET/MR systems demanded great efforts for accurate attenuation correction (AC) but differences in technology, geometry and hardware attenuation may also affect quantitative results. Dedicated PET systems using transmission-based AC are regarded as the gold standard for quantitative brain PET. The study aim was to investigate the agreement between quantitative PET outcomes from a PET/MR scanner against a stand-alone PET system. Nine patients with Parkinsonism underwent two 80-min dynamic PET scans with the dopamine transporter ligand [11C]PE2I. Images were reconstructed with resolution-matched settings using68Ge-transmission (stand-alone PET), and zero-echo-time MR (PET/MR) scans for AC. Non-displaceable binding potential (BPND) and relative delivery (R1) were evaluated using volumes of interest and voxel-wise analysis. Correlations between systems were high (r ≥ 0.85) for both quantitative outcome parameters in all brain regions. Striatal BPNDwas significantly lower on PET/MR than on stand-alone PET (-7%). R1was significantly overestimated in posterior cortical regions (9%) and underestimated in striatal (-9%) and limbic areas (-6%). The voxel-wise evaluation revealed that the MR-safe headphones caused a negative bias in both parametric BPNDand R1images. Additionally, a significant positive bias of R1was found in the auditory cortex, most likely due to the acoustic background noise during MR imaging. The relative bias of the quantitative [11C]PE2I PET data acquired from a SIGNA PET/MR system was in the same order as the expected test-retest reproducibility of [11C]PE2I BPNDand R1, compared to a stand-alone ECAT PET scanner. MR headphones and background noise are potential sources of error in functional PET/MR studies.

TITLE: A Bayesian approach to tissue-fraction estimation for oncological PET segmentation

AUTHORS: Ziping Liu, Joyce C Mhlanga, Richard Laforest, Paul-Robert Derenoncourt, Barry A Siegel, Abhinav K Jha

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Tumor segmentation in oncological PET is challenging, a major reason being the partial-volume effects (PVEs) that arise due to low system resolution and finite voxel size. The latter results in tissue-fraction effects (TFEs), i.e. voxels contain a mixture of tissue classes. Conventional segmentation methods are typically designed to assign each image voxel as belonging to a certain tissue class. Thus, these methods are inherently limited in modeling TFEs. To address the challenge of accounting for PVEs, and in particular, TFEs, we propose a Bayesian approach to tissue-fraction estimation for oncological PET segmentation. Specifically, this Bayesian approach estimates the posterior mean of the fractional volume that the tumor occupies within each image voxel. The proposed method, implemented using a deep-learning-based technique, was first evaluated using clinically realistic 2D simulation studies with known ground truth, in the context of segmenting the primary tumor in PET images of patients with lung cancer. The evaluation studies demonstrated that the method accurately estimated the tumor-fraction areas and significantly outperformed widely used conventional PET segmentation methods, including a U-net-based method, on the task of segmenting the tumor. In addition, the proposed method was relatively insensitive to PVEs and yielded reliable tumor segmentation for different clinical-scanner configurations. The method was then evaluated using clinical images of patients with stage IIB/III non-small cell lung cancer from ACRIN 6668/RTOG 0235 multi-center clinical trial. Here, the results showed that the proposed method significantly outperformed all other considered methods and yielded accurate tumor segmentation on patient images with Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.82 (95% CI: 0.78, 0.86). In particular, the method accurately segmented relatively small tumors, yielding a high DSC of 0.77 for the smallest segmented cross-section of 1.30 cm2. Overall, this study demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed method to accurately segment tumors in PET images.

TITLE: Automated Segmentation of Baseline Metabolic Total Tumor Burden in Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma: Which Method Is Most Successful? A Study on Behalf of the PETRA Consortium

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Metabolic tumor volume (MTV) is a promising biomarker of pretreatment risk in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Different segmentation methods can be used that predict prognosis equally well but give different optimal cutoffs for risk stratification. Segmentation can be cumbersome; a fast, easy, and robust method is needed. Our aims were to evaluate the best automated MTV workflow in DLBCL; determine whether uptake time, compliance or noncompliance with standardized recommendations for18F-FDG scanning, and subsequent disease progression influence the success of segmentation; and assess differences in MTVs and discriminatory power of segmentation methods.Methods:One hundred forty baseline18F-FDG PET/CT scans were selected from U.K. and Dutch studies on DLBCL to provide a balance between scans at 60 and 90 min of uptake, parameters compliant and noncompliant with standardized recommendations for scanning, and patients with and without progression. An automated tool was applied for segmentation using an SUV of 2.5 (SUV2.5), an SUV of 4.0 (SUV4.0), adaptive thresholding (A50P), 41% of SUVmax(41%), a majority vote including voxels detected by at least 2 methods (MV2), and a majority vote including voxels detected by at least 3 methods (MV3). Two independent observers rated the success of the tool to delineate MTV. Scans that required minimal interaction were rated as a success; scans that missed more than 50% of the tumor or required more than 2 editing steps were rated as a failure.Results:One hundred thirty-eight scans were evaluable, with significant differences in success and failure ratings among methods. The best performing was SUV4.0, with higher success and lower failure rates than any other method except MV2, which also performed well. SUV4.0 gave a good approximation of MTV in 105 (76%) scans, with simple editing for a satisfactory result in additionally 20% of cases. MTV was significantly different for all methods between patients with and without progression. The 41% segmentation method performed slightly worse, with longer uptake times; otherwise, scanning conditions and patient outcome did not influence the tool's performance. The discriminative power was similar among methods, but MTVs were significantly greater using SUV4.0 and MV2 than using other thresholds, except for SUV2.5.Conclusion:SUV4.0 and MV2 are recommended for further evaluation. Automated estimation of MTV is feasible.

TITLE: Simplified protocol for whole-body Patlak parametric imaging with 18 F-FDG PET/CT: Feasibility and error analysis

AUTHORS: Shulin Yao, Tao Feng, Yizhang Zhao, Runze Wu, Ruimin Wang, Shina Wu, Can Li, Baixuan Xu

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Parametric imaging using the Patlak model has been shown to provide improved lesion detectability and specificity. The Patlak model requires both tissue time-activity curves (TACs) after equilibrium and knowledge of the input function from the start of injection. Therefore, the conventional dynamic scanning protocol typically starts from the radiotracer injection all the way to equilibrium. In this paper, we propose the use of hybrid population-based and model-based input function estimation and evaluate its use for whole-body Patlak analysis, in order to reduce the total scan time and simplify clinical Patlak parametric imaging protocols. Possible quantitative errors caused by the simplified scanning protocol were also analyzed both theoretically and with the use of clinical data.

Materials and methods: Clinical data from 24 patients referred for tumor staging were included in this study. The patients underwent a whole-body dynamic PET study, 20 min after FDG injection (0.13 mCi/kg). The proposed whole-body scanning protocol includes 6 passes with 4-5 bed positions, depending on the size of the patient, with 2 min for each bed position. An input function from the literature was selected as the shape of the population-based input function. The descending aorta from the corresponding CT image was segmented and applied on the reconstructed dynamic PET images to acquire an image-based input function, which was later fitted using an exponential model. Due to the late scan time, only the later portion of the input function was available, which was used to scale the population-based input function. The hybrid input function was used to derive the whole-body Patlak images. Assuming a given error in the population-based input function, its influence on the final Patlak images were also derived theoretically and verified using the clinical data sets. Finally, the image quality of the reconstructed Patlak slope image was evaluated by an experienced radiologist in four different aspects: image artifacts, image noise, lesion sharpness, and lesion detectability.

Results: It was found that errors in the population-based input function only affect the absolute scale of the Patlak slope image. The induced error is proportional to the percentage area-under-curve (AUC) error in the input function. These findings were also confirmed by numerical analysis. The predicted global scale was in good agreement with results from both image-based Patlak and direct Patlak approach. The fractions of the AUC from the early portion population-based input function were also found to be around 18% of the total AUC of the input function, further limiting the propagation of quantitation error from population-based input function to the final Patlak slope image. The reconstructed Patlak images were also found by the radiologist to provide excellent confidence in lesion detection tasks.

Conclusions: We have proposed a simplified whole-body scanning protocol that utilizes both population-based input function and model-based input function. The error from the population-based function was found to only affect the global scale and the overall quantitative impact can be predicted using our proposed formulas.

TITLE: Deep learning for whole-body medical image generation

AUTHORS: Joshua Schaefferkoetter, Jianhua Yan, Sangkyu Moon, Rosanna Chan, Claudia Ortega, Ur Metser, Alejandro Berlin, Patrick Veit-Haibach

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms based on deep convolutional networks have demonstrated remarkable success for image transformation tasks. State-of-the-art results have been achieved by generative adversarial networks (GANs) and training approaches which do not require paired data. Recently, these techniques have been applied in the medical field for cross-domain image translation.

Purpose: This study investigated deep learning transformation in medical imaging. It was motivated to identify generalizable methods which would satisfy the simultaneous requirements of quality and anatomical accuracy across the entire human body. Specifically, whole-body MR patient data acquired on a PET/MR system were used to generate synthetic CT image volumes. The capacity of these synthetic CT data for use in PET attenuation correction (AC) was evaluated and compared to current MR-based attenuation correction (MR-AC) methods, which typically use multiphase Dixon sequences to segment various tissue types.

Materials and methods: This work aimed to investigate the technical performance of a GAN system for general MR-to-CT volumetric transformation and to evaluate the performance of the generated images for PET AC. A dataset comprising matched, same-day PET/MR and PET/CT patient scans was used for validation.

Results: A combination of training techniques was used to produce synthetic images which were of high-quality and anatomically accurate. Higher correlation was found between the values of mu maps calculated directly from CT data and those derived from the synthetic CT images than those from the default segmented Dixon approach. Over the entire body, the total amounts of reconstructed PET activities were similar between the two MR-AC methods, but the synthetic CT method yielded higher accuracy for quantifying the tracer uptake in specific regions.

Conclusion: The findings reported here demonstrate the feasibility of this technique and its potential to improve certain aspects of attenuation correction for PET/MR systems. Moreover, this work may have larger implications for establishing generalized methods for inter-modality, whole-body transformation in medical imaging. Unsupervised deep learning techniques can produce high-quality synthetic images, but additional constraints may be needed to maintain medical integrity in the generated data.

AUTHORS: Tonke L de Jong, Daniëlle Koopman, Jorn A van Dalen, Aline Tegelaar, Joris D van Dijk, Henk Stevens, Pieter L Jager

JOURNAL: Annals of nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Digital PET systems (dPET) improve lesion detectability as compared to PET systems with conventional photomultiplier tubes (cPET). We prospectively studied the performance of high-resolution digital PET scans in patients with cancer, as compared with high- and standard-resolution conventional PET scans, taking the acquisition order into account.

Methods: We included 212 patients with cancer, who were referred for disease staging or restaging. All patients underwent FDG-PET/CT on a dPET scanner and on a cPET scanner in a randomized order. The scans were acquired immediately after each other. Three image reconstructions were generated: 1) standard-resolution (4 × 4 × 4 mm3voxels) cPET, 2) high-resolution (2 × 2 × 2 mm3voxels) cPET, and 3) high-resolution dPET. Two experienced PET readers visually assessed the three reconstructions side-by-side and ranked them according to scan preference, in an independent and blinded fashion.

Results: On high-resolution dPET, the PET readers detected more lesions or they had a higher diagnostic confidence than on high- and standard-resolution cPET (p < 0.001). High-resolution dPET was preferred in 90% of the cases, as compared to 44% for high-resolution cPET and 1% for standard-resolution cPET (p < 0.001). However, for the subgroup of patients where dPET was made first (n = 103, 61 ± 10 min after FDG administration) and cPET was made second (93 ± 15 min after FDG administration), no significant difference in preference was found between the high-resolution cPET and dPET reconstructions (p = 0.41).

Conclusions: DPET scanners in combination with high-resolution reconstructions clinically outperform cPET scanners with both high- and standard-resolution reconstructions as the PET readers identified more FDG-avid lesions, their diagnostic confidence was increased, and they visually preferred dPET. However, when dPET was made first, high-resolution dPET and high-resolution cPET showed similar performance, indicating the positive effect of a prolonged FDG uptake time. Therefore, high-resolution cPET in combination with a prolonged FDG uptake time can be considered as an alternative.

TITLE: Crystal-level timing calibration using cascaded photons of60Co point source for long axial animal PET system

AUTHORS: Qing Wei, Daowu Li, Xianchao Huang, Long Wei, Zhiming Zhang, Xiaorou Han, Yingjie Wang

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Objective.Timing calibration is essential for positron emission tomography (PET) system as it enhances timing resolution to improve image quality. Traditionally, positron sources are employed for timing calibration. However, the photons emitted by these sources travel in opposite directions, necessitating that positrons annihilate at multiple locations to collect coincidence data across a greater number of lines of response. To overcome this limitation, this study proposes a timing calibration method utilising a60Co point source.Approach.The60Co source emits cascaded photons without angular correlation, allowing the collection of coincidence events throughout the field of view (FOV) with a single60Co point source positioned at the centre of the FOV to determine the timing offsets of the pixels. Leveraging the properties of60Co, we propose a calibration method and implement it on a long axial animal PET system. Initially, we calibrated the timing offsets of the pixels within two blocks to establish reference detectors, and subsequently employed a60Co point source to determine the timing offsets of all the pixels in the system relative to these reference detectors. In addition, we evaluated the system's timing resolution before and after the calibration to validate the efficacy of the proposed method.Main results.We measured the timing offsets of the pixels across the entire system, ranging from -5.0 to 2.0 ns. After implementing the timing offset lookup table, the system timing resolution was improved from 6.30 ns before calibration to 1.04 ns.Significance. In this study, the60Co source is employed for timing calibration, offering the advantages of operational simplicity, broad applicability, and potential application in time-of-flight PET.

TITLE: Integration of PET/CT Radiomics and Semantic Features for Differentiation between Active Pulmonary Tuberculosis and Lung Cancer

AUTHORS: Dongyang Du, Jiamei Gu, Xiaohui Chen, Wenbing Lv, Qianjin Feng, Arman Rahmim, Hubing Wu, Lijun Lu

JOURNAL: Molecular imaging and biology

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: We aim to accurately differentiate between active pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) and lung cancer (LC) based on radiomics and semantic features as extracted from pre-treatment positron emission tomography/X-ray computed tomography (PET/CT) images.

Procedures: A total of 174 patients (77/97 pulmonary TB/LC as confirmed by pathology) were retrospectively selected, with 122 in the training cohort and 52 in the validation cohort. Four hundred eighty-seven radiomics features were initially extracted to quantify phenotypic characteristics of the lesion region in both PET and CT images. Eleven semantic features were additionally defined by two experienced nuclear medicine physicians. Feature selection was performed in 5 steps to enable derivation of robust and effective signatures. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was subsequently used to develop a radiomics nomogram. The calibration, discrimination, and clinical usefulness of the nomogram were evaluated in both the training and independent validation cohorts.

Results: The individualized radiomics nomogram, which combined PET/CT radiomics signature with semantic features, demonstrated good calibration and significantly improved the diagnostic performance with respect to the semantic model alone or PET/CT signature alone in training cohort (AUC 0.97 vs. 0.94 or 0.91, p = 0.0392 or 0.0056), whereas did not significantly improve the performance in validation cohort (AUC 0.93 vs. 0.89 or 0.91, p = 0.3098 or 0.3323).

Conclusion: The radiomics nomogram showed potential for individualized differential diagnosis between solid active pulmonary TB and solid LC, although the improvement of performance was not significant relative to semantic model.

Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia, typically characterized by memory loss followed by progressive cognitive decline and functional impairment. Many clinical trials of potential therapies for AD have failed, and there is currently no approved disease-modifying treatment. Biomarkers for early detection and mechanistic understanding of disease course are critical for drug development and clinical trials. Amyloid has been the focus of most biomarker research. Here, we developed a deep learning-based framework to identify informative features for AD classification using tau positron emission tomography (PET) scans.

Results: The 3D convolutional neural network (CNN)-based classification model of AD from cognitively normal (CN) yielded an average accuracy of 90.8% based on five-fold cross-validation. The LRP model identified the brain regions in tau PET images that contributed most to the AD classification from CN. The top identified regions included the hippocampus, parahippocampus, thalamus, and fusiform. The layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) results were consistent with those from the voxel-wise analysis in SPM12, showing significant focal AD associated regional tau deposition in the bilateral temporal lobes including the entorhinal cortex. The AD probability scores calculated by the classifier were correlated with brain tau deposition in the medial temporal lobe in MCI participants (r = 0.43 for early MCI and r = 0.49 for late MCI).

Conclusion: A deep learning framework combining 3D CNN and LRP algorithms can be used with tau PET images to identify informative features for AD classification and may have application for early detection during prodromal stages of AD.

TITLE: Robust Collaborative Clustering of Subjects and Radiomic Features for Cancer Prognosis

JOURNAL: IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering

ABSTRACT:
Feature dimensionality reduction plays an important role in radiomic studies with a large number of features. However, conventional radiomic approaches may suffer from noise, and feature dimensionality reduction techniques are not equipped to utilize latent supervision information of patient data under study, such as differences in patients, to learn discriminative low dimensional representations. To achieve robustness to noise and feature dimensionality reduction with improved discriminative power, we develop a robust collaborative clustering method to simultaneously cluster patients and radiomic features into distinct groups respectively under adaptive sparse regularization. Our method is built upon matrix tri-factorization enhanced by adaptive sparsity regularization for simultaneous feature dimensionality reduction and denoising. Particularly, latent grouping information of patients with distinct radiomic features is learned and utilized as supervision information to guide the feature dimensionality reduction, and noise in radiomic features is adaptively isolated in a Bayesian framework under a general assumption of Laplacian distributions of transform-domain coefficients. Experiments on synthetic data have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach in data clustering, and evaluation results on an FDG-PET/CT dataset of rectal cancer patients have demonstrated that the proposed method outperforms alternative methods in terms of both patient stratification and prediction of patient clinical outcomes.

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Background: Bone marrow (BM) is the dominant dose-limiting organ in [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 therapy for patients with metastasized castration resistant prostate cancer, where BM dosimetry is challenging due to segmentation.

Purpose: We aim to develop an automatic image-based segmentation method on peri-therapeutic sequential [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 images for personalized BM dosimetry.

Methods: Quantitative SPECT/CT imaging at 2, 20, 40 and 60 (n = 14)/200 (n = 16) h post [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 injection were analyzed for 10 patients with 30 treatment cycles. X-means clustering was applied on the deep learning-based segmented lumbar spines CT images to classify the BM region. A single threshold method, two empirical segmentation methods (one sphere and five spheres), and gold standard manual segmentation were also implemented. The Dice similarity coefficient between BM masks of the X-means clustering and single threshold method was calculated as compared to the gold standard. BM mean absorbed dose (Dmean) was obtained for different segmentation methods. Absolute errors and Bland-Altman analysis were also evaluated for BM Dmeanderived from evaluated segmentation methods compared with the gold standard. Wilcoxon signed-rank test was performed for statistical evaluation. BM Dmeanwas correlated with the change of platelets and white blood cells (WBC) pre- and post-treatment using Pearson correlation analysis.

Results: In 30 cycles of 10 patients, the average Dice is 0.76 ± 0.18 for the X-means clustering method, as compared to 0.61 ± 0.19 for the single threshold method. The gold standard yields mean BM Dmeanof 0.46 ± 0.69 Gy. The X-means clustering method exhibits significantly (p < 0.01) lower mean absolute BM Dmean(25.34 ± 64.48%) errors, followed by the single threshold (32.46 ± 69.49%), one sphere (50.53 ± 35.40%), and five spheres (72.73 ± 115.97%) methods. Bland-Altman analysis reveals that the X-means clustering method has a smaller Dmeandifference (0.0330 Gy) compared to the single threshold (0.0512 Gy), one sphere (-0.1903 Gy), and five spheres (0.2108 Gy) methods. Stronger correlations (r ≤ -0.65) are found between platelets/WBC changes and BM Dmeanfrom both the gold standard and X-means clustering methods than other methods.

Conclusions: X-means clustering is feasible to segment the BM based on the CT images of peri-therapy SPECT/CT and shows advantages compared with the single threshold and empirical sphere segmentation methods.

TITLE: Evaluating and comparing the image quality and quantification accuracy of SiPM-PET/CT and PMT-PET/CT

AUTHORS: Yuji Tsutsui, Shinichi Awamoto, Kazuhiko Himuro, Toyoyuki Kato, Shingo Baba, Masayuki Sasaki

JOURNAL: Annals of nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the image quality and the quantification accuracy of Biograph Vision PET/CT scanner as a SiPM-PET in comparison to the conventional PMT-PET, Biograph mCT PET/CT scanner.

Methods: This study consisted of a phantom study and a retrospective clinical analysis where patients underwent18F-FDG PET/CT in both PET systems. The body phantom of the NEMA IEC with 10-37 mm diameter spheres were filled with an18F-FDG solution. The root mean square error (RMSE) of SUV, the detectability of 10-mm sphere, NECphantom, the background variability (N10mm) and the contrast-noise-ratio (QH,10 mm/N10mm) were calculated based on the phantom analysis. We also examined the quality of the acquired clinical images using the NECpatient, NECdensity, SNRliver, SUVliverand SUVlesion.

Results: In the phantom study on Vision scanner, RMSE was relatively lower when the iteration number was 2, 3 or 4. To satisfy a visual score of 1.5 and the reference range of QH,10 mm/N10mm, a 60-s or longer acquisition was required. Our clinical findings show that NECpatientaveraged 17.4 ± 1.72 Mcounts/m in mCT and 29.1 ± 2.83 Mcounts/m in Vision. Furthermore, NECdensityaveraged 0.29 ± 0.05 kcounts/cm3in mCT and 0.53 ± 0.09 kcounts/cm3in Vision, respectively, whereas SNRliveraveraged 14.6 ± 3.77% in mCT and 21.3 ± 1.69% in Vision (P = 0.0156), respectively. Finally, SUVliveraveraged 2.82 ± 0.28 and 2.55 ± 0.30, SUVlesionranged 1.6-17.6 and 1.9-22.9 in mCT and Vision, respectively.

Conclusion: SiPM-PET/CT provides superior image quality and quantification accuracy compared to PMT-PET/CT.

ABSTRACT:
11C-UCB-J ((R)-1-((3-(11C-methyl-11C)pyridin-4-yl)methyl)-4-(3,4,5-trifluorophenyl)pyrrolidin-2-one) is a PET tracer for synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A, which may be a marker of synaptic density. To simplify the scan protocol, SUV ratios (SUVRs) were compared with model-based nondisplaceable binding potential (BPND) to select the optimal time window in healthy and neuropsychiatric subjects.Methods:In total, 141 scans were acquired for 90 min. Arterial blood sampling and metabolite analysis were conducted. SUVR-1 (centrum semiovale reference region) was computed for six 30-min windows and compared with 1-tissue-compartment modelBPNDSimulations were performed to assess the time dependency of SUVR-1.Results:Greater correlation and less bias were observed for SUVR-1 at later time windows for all subjects. Simulations showed that the agreement between SUVR-1 andBPNDis time-dependent.Conclusion:The 60- to 90-min period provided the best match between SUVR-1 andBPND(-1% ± 7%); thus, a short scan is sufficient for accurate quantification of11C-UCB-J-specific binding.

TITLE: Deep learning-based T1-enhanced selection of linear attenuation coefficients (DL-TESLA) for PET/MR attenuation correction in dementia neuroimaging

AUTHORS: Yasheng Chen, Chunwei Ying, Michael M Binkley, Meher R Juttukonda, Shaney Flores, Richard Laforest, Tammie L S Benzinger, Hongyu An

JOURNAL: Magnetic resonance in medicine

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: The accuracy of existing PET/MR attenuation correction (AC) has been limited by a lack of correlation between MR signal and tissue electron density. Based on our finding that longitudinal relaxation rate, or R1, is associated with CT Hounsfield unit in bone and soft tissues in the brain, we propose a deep learning T1-enhanced selection of linear attenuation coefficients (DL-TESLA) method to incorporate quantitative R1for PET/MR AC and evaluate its accuracy and longitudinal test-retest repeatability in brain PET/MR imaging.

Methods: DL-TESLA uses a 3D residual UNet (ResUNet) for pseudo-CT (pCT) estimation. With a total of 174 participants, we compared PET AC accuracy of DL-TESLA to 3 other methods adopting similar 3D ResUNet structures but using UTE, or Dixon, or T1-MPRAGE as input. With images from 23 additional participants repeatedly scanned, the test-retest differences and within-subject coefficient of variation of standardized uptake value ratios (SUVR) were compared between PET images reconstructed using either DL-TESLA or CT for AC.

Results: DL-TESLA had (1) significantly lower mean absolute error in pCT, (2) the highest Dice coefficients in both bone and air, (3) significantly lower PET relative absolute error in whole brain and various brain regions, (4) the highest percentage of voxels with a PET relative error within both ±3% and ±5%, (5) similar to CT test-retest differences in SUVRs from the cerebrum and mean cortical (MC) region, and (6) similar to CT within-subject coefficient of variation in cerebrum and MC.

Conclusion: DL-TESLA demonstrates excellent PET/MR AC accuracy and test-retest repeatability.

TITLE: Effect of blood glucose and body weight on image quality in brain [18F]FDG PET imaging

AUTHORS: Otto M Henriksen, Søren Holm, Lisbeth Marner, Ian Law

JOURNAL: Nuclear medicine communications

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Objectives: The aims of the present study were to assess the influence of mild to moderate hyperglycaemia and body weight on brain 2-[F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose ([F]FDG) PET, and to what extent a simple algorithm for maintaining count density may compensate for these effects.

Methods: We prospectively included 63 patients undergoing routine brain [F]FDG PET. Scan time and injected activity were adjusted in patients with hyperglycaemia or increased body weight. Measures of perceived image quality, image noise and image contrast were obtained in both standard scans and intervention scans.

Results: Elevated blood glucose and increased body weight were associated with reduced count density and increased image noise that in turn were associated with lower scores of perceived image quality. The proposed simple algorithm effectively maintained the image noise level and improved perceived image quality across the full range of elevated blood glucose values and body weights, although the effect of intervention on perceived image quality was attenuated by lower image contrast in patients with moderate hyperglycaemia. In patients with increased body weight or blood glucose, the fraction of scans with poor image quality decreased from 9/29 to 2/29 (P = 0.04) and the fraction with good image quality increased from 7/29 to 20/29 (P = 0.001) when applying the proposed algorithm.

Conclusions: Increasing blood glucose and body weight are associated with increased image noise in standard imaging conditions. Improving count density by prolonging scan time and increasing injected activity significantly improves image quality in hyperglycaemic patients, although the image contrast remains reduced in patients with most pronounced hyperglycaemia.

AUTHORS: Nicolò Capobianco, Michel Meignan, Anne-Ségolène Cottereau, Laetitia Vercellino, Ludovic Sibille, Bruce Spottiswoode, Sven Zuehlsdorff, Olivier Casasnovas, Catherine Thieblemont, Irène Buvat

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Total metabolic tumor volume (TMTV), calculated from18F-FDG PET/CT baseline studies, is a prognostic factor in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) whose measurement requires the segmentation of all malignant foci throughout the body. No consensus currently exists regarding the most accurate approach for such segmentation. Further, all methods still require extensive manual input from an experienced reader. We examined whether an artificial intelligence-based method could estimate TMTV with a comparable prognostic value to TMTV measured by experts.Methods:Baseline18F-FDG PET/CT scans of 301 DLBCL patients from the REMARC trial (NCT01122472) were retrospectively analyzed using a prototype software (PET Assisted Reporting System [PARS]). An automated whole-body high-uptake segmentation algorithm identified all 3-dimensional regions of interest (ROIs) with increased tracer uptake. The resulting ROIs were processed using a convolutional neural network trained on an independent cohort and classified as nonsuspicious or suspicious uptake. The PARS-based TMTV (TMTVPARS) was estimated as the sum of the volumes of ROIs classified as suspicious uptake. The reference TMTV (TMTVREF) was measured by 2 experienced readers using independent semiautomatic software. The TMTVPARSwas compared with the TMTVREFin terms of prognostic value for progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).Results:TMTVPARSwas significantly correlated with the TMTVREF(ρ = 0.76;P< 0.001). Using PARS, an average of 24 regions per subject with increased tracer uptake was identified, and an average of 20 regions per subject was correctly identified as nonsuspicious or suspicious, yielding 85% classification accuracy, 80% sensitivity, and 88% specificity, compared with the TMTVREFregion. Both TMTV results were predictive of PFS (hazard ratio, 2.3 and 2.6 for TMTVPARSand TMTVREF, respectively;P< 0.001) and OS (hazard ratio, 2.8 and 3.7 for TMTVPARSand TMTVREF, respectively;P< 0.001).Conclusion:TMTVPARSwas consistent with that obtained by experts and displayed a significant prognostic value for PFS and OS in DLBCL patients. Classification of high-uptake regions using deep learning for rapidly discarding physiologic uptake may considerably simplify TMTV estimation, reduce observer variability, and facilitate the use of TMTV as a predictive factor in DLBCL patients.

TITLE: Bias evaluation and reduction in 3D OP-OSEM reconstruction in dynamic equilibrium PET studies with 11C-labeled for binding potential analysis

AUTHORS: Cláudia Régio Brambilla, Jürgen Scheins, Ahlam Issa, Lutz Tellmann, Hans Herzog, Elena Rota Kops, N Jon Shah, Irene Neuner, Christoph W Lerche

JOURNAL: PloS one

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Iterative image reconstruction is widely used in positron emission tomography. However, it is known to contribute to quantitation bias and is particularly pronounced during dynamic studies with 11C-labeled radiotracers where count rates become low towards the end of the acquisition. As the strength of the quantitation bias depends on the counts in the reconstructed frame, it can differ from frame to frame of the acquisition. This is especially relevant in the case of neuro-receptor studies with simultaneous PET/MR when a bolus-infusion protocol is applied to allow the comparison of pre- and post-task effects. Here, count dependent changes in quantitation bias may interfere with task changes. We evaluated the impact of different framing schemes on quantitation bias and its propagation into binding potential (BP) using a phantom decay study with 11C and 3D OP-OSEM. Further, we propose a framing scheme that keeps the true counts per frame constant over the acquisition time as constant framing schemes and conventional increasing framing schemes are unlikely to achieve stable bias values during the acquisition time range. For a constant framing scheme with 5 minutes frames, the BP bias was 7.13±2.01% (10.8% to 3.8%) compared to 5.63±2.85% (7.8% to 4.0%) for conventional increasing framing schemes. Using the proposed constant true counts framing scheme, a stabilization of the BP bias was achieved at 2.56±3.92% (3.5% to 1.7%). The change in BP bias was further studied by evaluating the linear slope during the acquisition time interval. The lowest slope values were observed in the constant true counts framing scheme. The constant true counts framing scheme was effective for BP bias stabilization at relevant activity and time ranges. The mean BP bias under these conditions was 2.56±3.92%, which represents the lower limit for the detection of changes in BP during equilibrium and is especially important in the case of cognitive tasks where the expected changes are low.

TITLE: Attenuation correction using deep Learning and integrated UTE/multi-echo Dixon sequence: evaluation in amyloid and tau PET imaging

AUTHORS: Kuang Gong, Paul Kyu Han, Keith A Johnson, Georges El Fakhri, Chao Ma, Quanzheng Li

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: PET measures of amyloid and tau pathologies are powerful biomarkers for the diagnosis and monitoring of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Because cortical regions are close to bone, quantitation accuracy of amyloid and tau PET imaging can be significantly influenced by errors of attenuation correction (AC). This work presents an MR-based AC method that combines deep learning with a novel ultrashort time-to-echo (UTE)/multi-echo Dixon (mUTE) sequence for amyloid and tau imaging.

Methods: Thirty-five subjects that underwent both 11C-PiB and 18F-MK6240 scans were included in this study. The proposed method was compared with Dixon-based atlas method as well as magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition with gradient echo (MPRAGE)- or Dixon-based deep learning methods. The Dice coefficient and validation loss of the generated pseudo-CT images were used for comparison. PET error images regarding standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) were quantified through regional and surface analysis to evaluate the final AC accuracy.

Results: The Dice coefficients of the deep learning methods based on MPRAGE, Dixon, and mUTE images were 0.84 (0.91), 0.84 (0.92), and 0.87 (0.94) for the whole-brain (above-eye) bone regions, respectively, higher than the atlas method of 0.52 (0.64). The regional SUVR error for the atlas method was around 6%, higher than the regional SUV error. The regional SUV and SUVR errors for all deep learning methods were below 2%, with mUTE-based deep learning method performing the best. As for the surface analysis, the atlas method showed the largest error (> 10%) near vertices inside superior frontal, lateral occipital, superior parietal, and inferior temporal cortices. The mUTE-based deep learning method resulted in the least number of regions with error higher than 1%, with the largest error (> 5%) showing up near the inferior temporal and medial orbitofrontal cortices.

Conclusion: Deep learning with mUTE can generate accurate AC for amyloid and tau imaging in PET/MR.

JOURNAL: Scientific reports

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
We implemented a two-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) for classification of polar maps extracted from Carimas (Turku PET Centre, Finland) software used for myocardial perfusion analysis. 138 polar maps from15O-H2O stress perfusion study in JPEG format from patients classified as ischemic or non-ischemic based on finding obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) on invasive coronary artery angiography were used. The CNN was evaluated against the clinical interpretation. The classification accuracy was evaluated with: accuracy (ACC), area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), F1 score (F1S), sensitivity (SEN), specificity (SPE) and precision (PRE). The CNN had a median ACC of 0.8261, AUC of 0.8058, F1S of 0.7647, SEN of 0.6500, SPE of 0.9615 and PRE of 0.9286. In comparison, clinical interpretation had ACC of 0.8696, AUC of 0.8558, F1S of 0.8333, SEN of 0.7500, SPE of 0.9615 and PRE of 0.9375. The CNN classified only 2 cases differently than the clinical interpretation. The clinical interpretation and CNN had similar accuracy in classifying false positives and true negatives. Classification of ischemia is feasible in15O-H2O stress perfusion imaging using JPEG polar maps alone with a custom CNN and may be useful for the detection of obstructive CAD.

JOURNAL: Cerebral cortex (New York, N.Y. : 1991)

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Brain energy budgets specify metabolic costs emerging from underlying mechanisms of cellular and synaptic activities. While current bottom-up energy budgets use prototypical values of cellular density and synaptic density, predicting metabolism from a person's individualized neuropil density would be ideal. We hypothesize that in vivo neuropil density can be derived from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, consisting of longitudinal relaxation (T1) MRI for gray/white matter distinction and diffusion MRI for tissue cellularity (apparent diffusion coefficient, ADC) and axon directionality (fractional anisotropy, FA). We present a machine learning algorithm that predicts neuropil density from in vivo MRI scans, where ex vivo Merker staining and in vivo synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A Positron Emission Tomography (SV2A-PET) images were reference standards for cellular and synaptic density, respectively. We used Gaussian-smoothed T1/ADC/FA data from 10 healthy subjects to train an artificial neural network, subsequently used to predict cellular and synaptic density for 54 test subjects. While excellent histogram overlaps were observed both for synaptic density (0.93) and cellular density (0.85) maps across all subjects, the lower spatial correlations both for synaptic density (0.89) and cellular density (0.58) maps are suggestive of individualized predictions. This proof-of-concept artificial neural network may pave the way for individualized energy atlas prediction, enabling microscopic interpretations of functional neuroimaging data.

TITLE: A machine learning framework with anatomical prior for online dose verification using positron emitters and PET in proton therapy

AUTHORS: Zongsheng Hu, Guangyao Li, Xiaoke Zhang, Kuangkuang Ye, Jiade Lu, Hao Peng

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
We developed a machine learning framework in order to establish the correlation between dose and activity distributions in proton therapy. A recurrent neural network was used to predict dose distribution in three dimensions based on the information of proton-induced positron emitters. Hounsfield Unit (HU) information from CT images and analytically derived stopping power (SP) information were incorporated as auxiliary inputs. Four different scenarios were investigated: Activity only, Activity + HU, Activity + SP and Activity + HU + SP. The performance was quantitatively studied in terms of mean absolute error (MAE) and mean relative error (MRE), under different signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). In addition to the first dataset of mono-energetic beams, three additional datasets were validated to help evaluate the generalization capability of our proposed model: a dataset of a lower SNR, five reconstructed PET images, and a dataset of spread-out Bragg peaks. Good verification accuracy of dose verification in three dimensions is demonstrated. The inclusion of anatomical information improves both accuracy and generalization. For an activity profile with an SNR of 4 (the mono-energetic case), the framework is able to obtain an MRE of ∼ 0.99% over the whole range and a range uncertainty of ∼ 0.27 mm. The machine learning-based framework may emerge as a useful tool to allow for online dose verification and quality assurance in proton therapy.

TITLE: A Comparison of Arterial Input Function Interpolation Methods for Patlak Plot Analysis of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET Prostate Cancer Studies

AUTHORS: Nathaniel J Smith, David T Newton, David Gunderman, Gary D Hutchins

JOURNAL: IEEE transactions on medical imaging

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging enables quantitative assessment of tissue physiology. Dynamic pharmacokinetic analysis of PET images requires accurate estimation of the radiotracer plasma input function to derive meaningful parameter estimates, and small discrepancies in parameter estimation can mimic subtle physiologic tissue variation. This study evaluates the impact of input function interpolation method on the accuracy of Patlak kinetic parameter estimation through simulations modeling the pharmacokinetic properties of [68Ga]-PSMA-11. This study evaluated both trained and untrained methods. Although the mean kinetic parameter accuracy was similar across all interpolation models, the trained node weighting interpolation model estimated accurate kinetic parameters with reduced overall variability relative to standard linear interpolation. Trained node weighting interpolation reduced kinetic parameter estimation variance by a magnitude approximating the underlying physiologic differences between normal and diseased prostatic tissue. Overall, this analysis suggests that trained node weighting improves the reliability of Patlak kinetic parameter estimation for [68Ga]-PSMA-11 PET.

JOURNAL: The quarterly journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging : official publication of the Italian Association of Nuclear Medicine (AIMN) [and] the International Association of Radiopharmacology (IAR), [and] Section of the Society of...

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Background: Attenuation correction (AC) is an important topic in PET/MRI and particularly challenging after brain tumor surgery, near metal implants, adjacent bone and burr holes. In this study, we evaluated the performance of two MR-driven AC methods, zero-echo-time AC (ZTE-AC) and atlas-AC, in comparison to reference standard CT-AC in patients with surgically treated brain tumors at11C-methionine PET/MRI.

Methods: This retrospective study investigated seven postoperative patients with neuropathologically confirmed brain tumor at11C-methionine PET/MRI. Three AC maps - ZTE-AC, atlas-AC and reference standard CT-AC - were generated for each patient. Standardized uptake values (SUV) were obtained at the metal implant, adjacent bone and burr hole. Standard uptake ratio (SUR) SURmetal/mirror, SURbone/mirror and SURburrhole/mirror were then calculated and analyzed with Bland-Altman, Pearson correlation and intraclass correlation reliability.

Results: Smaller mean percent bias range (Bland-Altman) was found for ZTE-AC than atlas-AC in all analyses (metal ZTE -0.46 to -0.02, metal atlas -3.57 to -3.26; bone ZTE -4.60 to -2.16, bone atlas -5.25 to -3.81; burr hole ZTE -0.95 to -0.52, burr hole atlas 7.86 to 8.87). Percent SD range (Bland-Altman) was large for both methods in all analyses, with lower absolute values for ZTE-AC (ZTE 7.02-8.49; atlas 11.47-14.83). A very strong correlation (Pearson correlation) was demonstrated for both methods compared to CT-AC (ZTE ρ 0.97-0.99, P<0.001; atlas ρ 0.88-0.91, P≤0.009) with higher absolute values for ZTE. An excellent intraclass correlation coefficient was found across all analyses for ZTE, atlas and CT maps (ICC ≥0.88).

Conclusions: ZTE for MR-driven PET attenuation correction presented a more comparable performance to reference standard CT-AC at the postoperative site. ZTE-AC may serve as a useful diagnostic tool for MR-driven AC in patients with surgically treated brain tumors.

ABSTRACT:
Extranodal natural killer/T cell lymphoma (ENKL), nasal type is a kind of rare disease with a low survival rate that primarily affects Asian and South American populations. Segmentation of ENKL lesions is crucial for clinical decision support and treatment planning. This paper is the first study on computer-aided diagnosis systems for the ENKL segmentation problem. We propose an automatic, coarse-to-fine approach for ENKL segmentation using adversarial networks. In the coarse stage, we extract the region of interest bounding the lesions utilizing a segmentation neural network. In the fine stage, we use an adversarial segmentation network and further introduce a multi-scale L1loss function to drive the network to learn both global and local features. The generator and discriminator are alternately trained by backpropagation in an adversarial fashion in a min-max game. Furthermore, we present the first exploration of zone-based uncertainty estimates based on Monte Carlo dropout technique in the context of deep networks for medical image segmentation. Specifically, we propose the uncertainty criteria based on the lesion and the background, and then linearly normalize them to a specific interval. This is not only the crucial criterion for evaluating the superiority of the algorithm, but also permits subsequent optimization by engineers and revision by clinicians after quantitatively understanding the main source of uncertainty from the background or the lesion zone. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is more effective and lesion-zone stable than state-of-the-art deep-learning based segmentation model.

TITLE: Effect of grey-level discretization on texture feature on different weighted MRI images of diverse disease groups

AUTHORS: Gergő Veres, Norman Félix Vas, Martin Lyngby Lassen, Monika Béresová, Aron K Krizsan, Attila Forgács, Ervin Berényi, László Balkay

JOURNAL: PloS one

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Many studies of MRI radiomics do not include the discretization method used for the analyses, which might indicate that the discretization methods used are considered irrelevant. Our goals were to compare three frequently used discretization methods (lesion relative resampling (LRR), lesion absolute resampling (LAR) and absolute resampling (AR)) applied to the same data set, along with two different lesion segmentation approaches.

Methods: We analyzed the effects of altering bin widths or bin numbers for the three different sampling methods using 40 texture indices (TIs). The impact was evaluated on brain MRI studies obtained for 71 patients divided into three different disease groups: multiple sclerosis (MS, N = 22), ischemic stroke (IS, N = 22), cancer patients (N = 27). Two different MRI acquisition protocols were considered for all patients, a T2- and a post-contrast 3D T1-weighted MRI sequence. Elliptical and manually drawn VOIs were employed for both imaging series. Three different types of gray-level discretization methods were used: LRR, LAR and AR. Hypothesis tests were done among all diseased and control areas to compare the TI values in these areas. We also did correlation analyses between TI values and lesion volumes.

Results: In general, no significant differences were reported in the results when employing the AR and LAR discretization methods. It was found that employing 38 TIs introduced variation in the results when the number of bin parameters was altered, suggesting that both the degree and direction of monotonicity between each TI value and binning parameters were characteristic for each TI. Furthermore, while TIs were changing with altering binning values, no changes correlated to neither disease nor the MRI sequence. We found that most indices correlated weakly with the volume, while the correlation coefficients were independent of both diseases analyzed and MR contrast. Several cooccurrence-matrix based texture parameters show a definite higher correlation when employing the LRR discretization method However, with the best correlations obtained for the manually drawn VOI. Hypothesis tests among all disease and control areas (co-lateral hemisphere) revealed that the AR or LAR discretization techniques provide more suitable texture features than LRR. In addition, the manually drawn segmentation gave fewer significantly different TIs than the ellipsoid segmentations. In addition, the amount of TIs with significant differences was increasing with increasing the number of bins, or decreasing bin widths.

Conclusion: Our findings indicate that the AR discretization method may offer the best texture analysis in MR image assessments. Employing too many bins or too large bin widths might reduce the selection of TIs that can be used for differential diagnosis. In general, more statistically different TIs were observed for elliptical segmentations when compared to the manually drawn VOIs. In the texture analysis of MR studies, studies and publications should report on all important parameters and methods related to data collection, corrections, normalization, discretization, and segmentation.

ABSTRACT:
In radiation oncology, predicting patient risk stratification allows specialization of therapy intensification as well as selecting between systemic and regional treatments, all of which helps to improve patient outcome and quality of life. Deep learning offers an advantage over traditional radiomics for medical image processing by learning salient features from training data originating from multiple datasets. However, while their large capacity allows to combine high-level medical imaging data for outcome prediction, they lack generalization to be used across institutions. In this work, a pseudo-volumetric convolutional neural network with a deep preprocessor module and self-attention (PreSANet) is proposed for the prediction of distant metastasis, locoregional recurrence, and overall survival occurrence probabilities within the 10 year follow-up time frame for head and neck cancer patients with squamous cell carcinoma. The model is capable of processing multi-modal inputs of variable scan length, as well as integrating patient data in the prediction model. These proposed architectural features and additional modalities all serve to extract additional information from the available data when availability to additional samples is limited. This model was trained on the public Cancer Imaging Archive Head-Neck-PET-CT dataset consisting of 298 patients undergoing curative radio/chemo-radiotherapy and acquired from 4 different institutions. The model was further validated on an internal retrospective dataset with 371 patients acquired from one of the institutions in the training dataset. An extensive set of ablation experiments were performed to test the utility of the proposed model characteristics, achieving an AUROC of [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] for DM, LR and OS respectively on the public TCIA Head-Neck-PET-CT dataset. External validation was performed on a retrospective dataset with 371 patients, achieving [Formula: see text] AUROC in all outcomes. To test for model generalization across sites, a validation scheme consisting of single site-holdout and cross-validation combining both datasets was used. The mean accuracy across 4 institutions obtained was [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] for DM, LR and OS respectively. The proposed model demonstrates an effective method for tumor outcome prediction for multi-site, multi-modal combining both volumetric data and structured patient clinical data.

TITLE: Study of the TOFPET2c ASIC in time-of-flight detection of x-rays for scatter rejection in medical imaging applications

AUTHORS: L-D Gaulin, V Nadig, K Herweg, G Lemaire, F Gagnon, J Bouchard, J Rossignol, V Schulz, R Fontaine, S Gundacker

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Objective.Integrating time-of-flight (ToF) measurements in radiography and computed tomography (CT) enables an approach for scatter rejection in imaging systems that eliminates the need for anti-scatter grids, potentially increasing system sensitivity and image quality. However, present hardware dedicated to the time-correlated measurement of x-rays is limited to a single pixel physically too large for the desired spatial resolution. A switch to highly integrated electronics and detectors is needed to progress towards detector arrays capable of acquiring images, while offering a timing resolution below 300 ps FWHM to achieve scatter rejection comparable to current anti-scatter grids.Approach.Using off-the-shelf scintillators, photodetectors and readouts designed for ToF positron emission tomography (PET) provides a preliminary evaluation of available highly integrated readout systems supporting detector arrays for ToF scatter rejection. The TOFPET2c ASIC from PETSys offers an established development platform necessary for fast and reliable results, with no known limitation regarding time-correlated detection of medical imaging x-rays (20-140 keV).Main results.Reliable photon detection down to 31 keV was achieved, reaching energy resolutions from 23% to 92% FWHM throughout the desired energy range. Optimal detector timing resolution (DTR) from 250 ps FWHM at 130 keV to 678 ps FWHM at 30 keV was reached. Strong time walk effects were observed, showing a time shift of 642 ps up to 1740 ps between events spanning the energies used in x-ray medical imaging.Significance.The TOFPET2c ASIC has shown its potential for ToF scatter rejection, but meets the time resolution requirement of 300 ps FWHM only for limited energies (110-140 keV). This significant timing degradation observed at lower energies limits the use of the TOFPET2c ASIC for ToF scatter rejection, but offers significant advancements regarding the understanding of the phenomenon arising from the time-correlated detection of medical imaging x-rays.

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Radiomics-based machine learning (ML) models of amino acid positron emission tomography (PET) images have shown efficiency in glioma prediction tasks. However, their clinical impact on physician interpretation remains limited. This study investigated whether an explainable radiomics model modifies nuclear physicians' assessment of glioma aggressiveness at diagnosis.

Methods: Patients underwent dynamic 6-[18F]fluoro-L-DOPA PET acquisition. With a 75%/25% split for training (n = 63) and test sets (n = 22), an ensemble ML model was trained using radiomics features extracted from static/dynamic parametric PET images to classify lesion aggressiveness. Three explainable ML methods-Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME), Anchor, and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP)-generated patient-specific explanations. Eighteen physicians from eight institutions evaluated the test samples. During the first phase, physicians analyzed the 22 cases exclusively through magnetic resonance and static/dynamic PET images, acquired within a maximum interval of 30 days. In the second phase, the same physicians reevaluated the same cases (n = 22), using all available data, including the radiomics model predictions and explanations.

Results: Eighty-five patients (54[39-62] years old, 41 women) were selected. In the second phase, physicians demonstrated a significant improvement in diagnostic accuracy compared to the first phase (0.775 [0.750-0.802] vs. 0.717 [0.694-0.737], p = 0.007). The explainable radiomics model augmented physician agreement, with a 22.72% increase in Fleiss's kappa, and significantly enhanced physician confidence (p < 0.001). Among all physicians, Anchor and SHAP showed efficacy in 75% and 72% of cases, respectively, outperforming LIME (p ≤ 0.001).

Conclusions: Our results highlight the potential of an explainable radiomics model using amino acid PET scans as a diagnostic support to assist physicians in identifying glioma aggressiveness.

ABSTRACT:
Positron emission tomography (PET) neuroimaging provides unique possibilities to study biological processes in vivo under basal and interventional conditions. For quantification of PET data, researchers commonly apply different arrays of sequential data analytic methods ("preprocessing pipeline"), but it is often unknown how the choice of preprocessing affects the final outcome. Here, we use an available data set from a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled [11C]DASB-PET study as a case to evaluate how the choice of preprocessing affects the outcome of the study. We tested the impact of 384 commonly used preprocessing strategies on a previously reported positive association between the change from baseline in neocortical serotonin transporter binding determined with [11C]DASB-PET, and change in depressive symptoms, following a pharmacological sex hormone manipulation intervention in 30 women. The two preprocessing steps that were most critical for the outcome were motion correction and kinetic modeling of the dynamic PET data. We found that 36% of the applied preprocessing strategies replicated the originally reported finding (p< 0.05). For preprocessing strategies with motion correction, the replication percentage was 72%, whereas it was 0% for strategies without motion correction. In conclusion, the choice of preprocessing strategy can have a major impact on a study outcome.

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: To implement and validate an existing algorithm for automatic delineation of white matter lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) on a local single-center dataset.

Methods: We implemented a white matter hyperintensity segmentation model, based on a 2D convolutional neural network, using the conventional T2-weighted fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI sequence as input. The model was adapted for delineation of MS lesions by further training on a local dataset of 93 MS patients with a total of 3040 lesions. A quantitative evaluation was performed on ten test patients, in which model-generated masks were compared to manually delineated masks from two expert delineators. A subsequent qualitative evaluation of the implemented model was performed by two expert delineators, in which generated delineation masks on a clinical dataset of 53 patients were rated acceptable (< 10% errors) or unacceptable (> 10% errors) based on the total number of true lesions.

Results: The quantitative evaluation resulted in an average accuracy score (F1) of 0.71, recall of 0.77 and dice similarity coefficient of 0.62. Our implemented model obtained the highest scores in all three metrics, when compared to three out of the box lesion segmentation models. In the clinical evaluation an average of 94% of our 53 model-generated masks were rated acceptable.

Conclusion: After adaptation to our local dataset, the implemented segmentation model was able to delineate MS lesions with a high clinical value as rated by delineation experts while outperforming popular out of the box applications. This serves as a promising step towards implementation of automatic lesion delineation in our MS clinic.

JOURNAL: Scientific reports

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Accurate and fully automated pancreas segmentation is critical for advancing imaging biomarkers in early pancreatic cancer detection and for biomarker discovery in endocrine and exocrine pancreatic diseases. We developed and evaluated a deep learning (DL)-based convolutional neural network (CNN) for automated pancreas segmentation using the largest single-institution dataset to date (n = 3031 CTs). Ground truth segmentations were performed by radiologists, which were used to train a 3D nnU-Net model through five-fold cross-validation, generating an ensemble of top-performing models. To assess generalizability, the model was externally validated on the multi-institutional AbdomenCT-1K dataset (n = 585), for which volumetric segmentations were newly generated by expert radiologists and will be made publicly available. In the test subset (n = 452), the CNN achieved a mean Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 0.94 (SD 0.05), demonstrating high spatial concordance with radiologist-annotated volumes (Concordance Correlation Coefficient [CCC]: 0.95). On the AbdomenCT-1K dataset, the model achieved a DSC of 0.96 (SD 0.04) and a CCC of 0.98, confirming its robustness across diverse imaging conditions. The proposed DL model establishes new performance benchmarks for fully automated pancreas segmentation, offering a scalable and generalizable solution for large-scale imaging biomarker research and clinical translation.

TITLE: Extracting and Selecting Robust Radiomic Features from PET/MR Images in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma

AUTHORS: Pengfei Yang, Lei Xu, Zuozhen Cao, Yidong Wan, Yi Xue, Yangkang Jiang, Eric Yen, Chen Luo, Jing Wang, Yi Rong, Tianye Niu

JOURNAL: Molecular imaging and biology

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Objectives: This work aims to study the variation, robustness, and feature redundancy of PET/MR radiomic features in the primary tumor of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).

Procedures: PET/MR scans of 21 NPC patients were used in this study. The primary tumor volumes were defined using PET, T2-weighted-MR (T2-MR), and diffusion-weighted MR (DW-MR) images. A random-dilation-erosion method was used to simulate 10 sets of tumor volumes for identifying features invariant with manual segmentation uncertainties. Feature robustness was evaluated against imaging modalities, pixel sizes, slice thickness, and grey-level bin sizes using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and spearman correlation coefficient. Feature redundancy was analyzed using the hierarchical cluster analysis.

Results: Voxel size of 0.5 × 0.5 × 1.0 mm3was found optimal for robust feature extraction from PET and MR. Normalized grey level of 64 and 128 was suggested for PET and MR, respectively. The features from wavelet-transformed images were less stable than those from the original images. The robustness analysis and volume correlation analysis identified 335 (62.04 %) PET features, 240 (44.44 %) T2-MR features, and 366 (67.78 %) DW-MR features. The cluster analysis grouped PET, T2-MR, and DW-MR features into 106, 83, and 133 representative features, respectively.

Conclusions: The present study analyzed and identified robust features extracted from tumor volumes on PET/MR, which can provide guidance and promote standardization for PET/MR radiomic studies in NPC.

ABSTRACT:
As the immuno-oncology field continues the rapid growth witnessed over the past decade, optimising patient outcomes requires an evolution in the current response-assessment guidelines for phase 2 and 3 immunotherapy clinical trials and clinical care. Additionally, investigational tools-including image analysis of standard-of-care scans (such as CT, magnetic resonance, and PET) with analytics, such as radiomics, functional magnetic resonance agents, and novel molecular-imaging PET agents-offer promising advancements for assessment of immunotherapy. To document current challenges and opportunities and identify next steps in immunotherapy diagnostic imaging, the National Cancer Institute Clinical Imaging Steering Committee convened a meeting with diverse representation among imaging experts and oncologists to generate a comprehensive review of the state of the field.

TITLE: Automated full body tumor segmentation in DOTATATE PET/CT for neuroendocrine cancer patients

AUTHORS: Alice Santilli, Prashanth Panyam, Arthur Autz, Rick Wray, John Philip, Pierre Elnajjar, Nathaniel Swinburne, Marius Mayerhoefer

JOURNAL: International journal of computer assisted radiology and surgery

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are a rare form of cancer that can occur anywhere in the body and commonly metastasizes. The large variance in location and aggressiveness of the tumors makes it a difficult cancer to treat. Assessments of the whole-body tumor burden in a patient image allow for better tracking of disease progression and inform better treatment decisions. Currently, radiologists rely on qualitative assessments of this metric since manual segmentation is unfeasible within a typical busy clinical workflow.

Methods: We address these challenges by extending the application of the nnU-net pipeline to produce automatic NET segmentation models. We utilize the ideal imaging type of 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT to produce segmentation masks from which to calculate total tumor burden metrics. We provide a human-level baseline for the task and perform ablation experiments of model inputs, architectures, and loss functions.

Results: Our dataset is comprised of 915 PET/CT scans and is divided into a held-out test set (87 cases) and 5 training subsets to perform cross-validation. The proposed models achieve test Dice scores of 0.644, on par with our inter-annotator Dice score on a subset 6 patients of 0.682. If we apply our modified Dice score to the predictions, the test performance reaches a score of 0.80.

Conclusion: In this paper, we demonstrate the ability to automatically generate accurate NET segmentation masks given PET images through supervised learning. We publish the model for extended use and to support the treatment planning of this rare cancer.

TITLE: Evaluation of 18F-FDG PET/CT images acquired with a reduced scan time duration in lymphoma patients using the digital biograph vision

AUTHORS: Manuel Weber, Walter Jentzen, Regina Hofferber, Ken Herrmann, Wolfgang Peter Fendler, Christoph Rischpler, Lale Umutlu, Maurizio Conti, Pedro Fragoso Costa, Miriam Sraieb, David Kersting

JOURNAL: BMC cancer

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Background: The superior accuracy and sensitivity of18F-FDG-PET/CT in comparison to morphological imaging alone leads to an upstaging in up to 30% of lymphoma patients. Novel digital PET/CT scanners might enable to reduce administered tracer activity or scan time duration while maintaining diagnostic performance; this might allow for a higher patient throughput or a reduced radiation exposure, respectively. In particular, the radiation exposure reduction is of interest due to the often young age and high remission rate of lymphoma patients.

Methods: Twenty patients with (suspected) lymphoma (6 for initial staging, 12 after systemic treatment, 2 in suspicion of recurrence) sequentially underwent18F-FDG-PET/CT examinations on a digital PET/CT (Siemens Biograph Vision) with a total scan time duration of 15 min (reference acquisition protocol) and 5 min (reduced acquisition protocol) using continuous-bed-motion. Both data sets were reconstructed using either standalone time of flight (TOF) or in combination with point spread function (PSF), each with 2 and 4 iterations. Lesion detectability by blinded assessment (separately for supra- and infradiaphragmal nodal lesions and for extranodal lesions), lesion image quantification, and image noise were used as metrics to assess diagnostic performance. Additionally, Deauville Score was compared for all patients after systemic treatment.

Results: All defined regions were correctly classified in the images acquired with reduced emission time, and therefore, no changes in staging were observed. Lesion quantification was acceptable, that is, mean absolute percentage deviation of maximum and peak standardized uptake values were 6.8 and 6.4% (derived from 30 lesions). A threefold reduction of scan time duration led to an increase in image noise from 7.1 to 11.0% (images reconstructed with 4 iterations) and from 4.7 to 7.2% (images reconstructed with 2 iterations). No deviations in Deauville Score were observed.

Conclusion: These results suggest that scan time duration or administered tracer activity can be reduced threefold without compromising diagnostic performance. Especially a reduction of administered activity might allow for a lower radiation exposure and better health economics. Larger trials are warranted to confirm our results.

AUTHORS: Ryoma Ito, Kazuki Motegi, Kosuke Yamashita, Noriaki Miyaji, Mitsutomi Ishiyama, Naoki Shimada, Shohei Fukai, Takashi Terauchi

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear medicine technology

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
This study aimed to validate the effectiveness of MotionFree (MF) in the abdominal region using 2 different PET/CT scanners to determine how to use MF efficiently.Methods:All 198 patients underwent respiratory-gated18F-FDG PET/CT with MF. Imaging was performed using Discovery MI (DMI) and Discovery IQ (DIQ) PET/CT scanners, and all data were divided into 2 groups in each category (abdominal: upper and lower abdomen, lesion size, <20 mm and ≥20 mm; scanner group: DMI and DIQ). A physician assessed whether the respiratory motion artifacts were reduced with MF. The SUV change rate (ΔSUV) of 80 measurable lesions with and without MF was calculated. The relationship between the ΔSUVs and these groups was compared.Results:Motion artifacts were reduced in 62 of 198 patients (31.3%) in the upper abdomen, in 1 of 198 patients (0.5%) in the lower abdomen, in 51 of 98 patients (52.0%) in the DMI, and in 12 of 100 patients (12.0%) in DIQ with MF. ΔSUVs were significantly higher in the upper abdomen than in the lower abdomen. ΔSUV was up to 58.3% in DMI and up to 47.6% in DIQ. ΔSUVs of lesions with a size of less than 20 mm were significantly higher than those with a lesion size of 20 mm or greater. Although DMI was more effective than DIQ in terms of motion artifacts, both DMI and DIQ have the potential to increase the SUV with MF. MF significantly reduced the respiratory motion artifacts and increased the SUV for lesions smaller than 20 mm in the upper abdomen.Conclusion:MF reduced the motion artifacts in higher-spatial-resolution PET/CT images. In both PET/CT scanners, SUVs in lesions smaller than 20 mm and lesions in the upper abdomen increased significantly with MF. To use MF without increasing the acquisition time, it may be useful to apply it to the upper abdomen.

TITLE: Deep learning-based metal artefact reduction in PET/CT imaging

AUTHORS: Hossein Arabi, Habib Zaidi

JOURNAL: European radiology

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Objectives: The susceptibility of CT imaging to metallic objects gives rise to strong streak artefacts and skewed information about the attenuation medium around the metallic implants. This metal-induced artefact in CT images leads to inaccurate attenuation correction in PET/CT imaging. This study investigates the potential of deep learning-based metal artefact reduction (MAR) in quantitative PET/CT imaging.

Methods: Deep learning-based metal artefact reduction approaches were implemented in the image (DLI-MAR) and projection (DLP-MAR) domains. The proposed algorithms were quantitatively compared to the normalized MAR (NMAR) method using simulated and clinical studies. Eighty metal-free CT images were employed for simulation of metal artefact as well as training and evaluation of the aforementioned MAR approaches. Thirty18F-FDG PET/CT images affected by the presence of metallic implants were retrospectively employed for clinical assessment of the MAR techniques.

Results: The evaluation of MAR techniques on the simulation dataset demonstrated the superior performance of the DLI-MAR approach (structural similarity (SSIM) = 0.95 ± 0.2 compared to 0.94 ± 0.2 and 0.93 ± 0.3 obtained using DLP-MAR and NMAR, respectively) in minimizing metal artefacts in CT images. The presence of metallic artefacts in CT images or PET attenuation correction maps led to quantitative bias, image artefacts and under- and overestimation of scatter correction of PET images. The DLI-MAR technique led to a quantitative PET bias of 1.3 ± 3% compared to 10.5 ± 6% without MAR and 3.2 ± 0.5% achieved by NMAR.

Conclusion: The DLI-MAR technique was able to reduce the adverse effects of metal artefacts on PET images through the generation of accurate attenuation maps from corrupted CT images.

Key points: • The presence of metallic objects, such as dental implants, gives rise to severe photon starvation, beam hardening and scattering, thus leading to adverse artefacts in reconstructed CT images. • The aim of this work is to develop and evaluate a deep learning-based MAR to improve CT-based attenuation and scatter correction in PET/CT imaging. • Deep learning-based MAR in the image (DLI-MAR) domain outperformed its counterpart implemented in the projection (DLP-MAR) domain. The DLI-MAR approach minimized the adverse impact of metal artefacts on whole-body PET images through generating accurate attenuation maps from corrupted CT images.

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear cardiology : official publication of the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Background: Myocardial perfusion imaging by positron emission tomography (PET-MPI) is the current gold standard for quantification of myocardial blood flow.18F-flurpiridaz was recently introduced as a valid alternative to currently used PET-MPI probes. Nonetheless, optimum scan duration and time interval for image analysis are currently unknown. Further, it is unclear whether rest/stress PET-MPI with18F-flurpiridaz is feasible in mice.

Methods: Rest/stress PET-MPI was performed with18F-flurpiridaz (0.6-3.0 MBq) in 27 mice aged 7-8 months. Regadenoson (0.1 µg/g) was used for induction of vasodilator stress. Kinetic modeling was performed using a metabolite-corrected arterial input function. Image-derived myocardial18F-flurpiridaz uptake was assessed for different time intervals by placing a volume of interest in the left ventricular myocardium.

Results: Tracer kinetics were best described by a two-tissue compartment model. K1ranged from 6.7 to 20.0 mL·cm-3·min-1, while myocardial volumes of distribution (VT) were between 34.6 and 83.6 mL·cm-3. Of note, myocardial18F-flurpiridaz uptake (%ID/g) was significantly correlated with K1at rest and following pharmacological vasodilation for all time intervals assessed. However, while Spearman's coefficients (rs) ranged between 0.478 and 0.681, R2values were generally low. In contrast, an excellent correlation of myocardial18F-flurpiridaz uptake with VTwas obtained, particularly when employing the averaged myocardial uptake from 20 to 40 min post tracer injection (R2≥ 0.98). Notably, K1and VTwere similarly sensitive to pharmacological vasodilation induction. Further, mean stress-to-rest ratios of K1, VT, and %ID/g18F-flurpiridaz were virtually identical, suggesting that %ID/g18F-flurpiridaz can be used to estimate coronary flow reserve (CFR) in mice.

Conclusion: Our findings suggest that a simplified assessment of relative myocardial perfusion and CFR, based on image-derived tracer uptake, is feasible with18F-flurpiridaz in mice, enabling high-throughput mechanistic CFR studies in rodents.

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Accurate identification of lymph node (LN) metastases is pivotal for surgical planning of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (PanNETs); however, current imaging techniques have sub-optimal diagnostic sensitivity. Aim of this study is to investigate whether [68Ga]Ga-DOTATOC PET radiomics might improve the identification of LN metastases in patients with non-functioning PanNET (NF-PanNET) referred to surgical intervention.

Methods: Seventy-two patients who performed preoperative [68Ga]Ga-DOTATOC PET between December 2017 and March 2022 for NF-PanNET. [68Ga]Ga-DOTATOC PET qualitative assessment of LN metastases was measured using diagnostic balanced accuracy (bACC), sensitivity (SN), specificity (SP), positive and negative predictive values (PPV, NPV). SUVmax, SUVmean, Somatostatin receptor density (SRD), total lesion SRD (TLSRD) and IBSI-compliant radiomic features (RFs) were obtained from the primary tumours. To predict LN involvement, these parameters were engineered, selected and used to train different machine learning models. Models were validated using tenfold repeated cross-validation and control models were developed. Models' bACC, SN, SP, PPV and NPV were collected and compared (Kruskal-Wallis, Mann-Whitney).

Results: LN metastases were detected in 29/72 patients at histology. [68Ga]Ga-DOTATOC PET qualitative examination of LN involvement provided bACC = 60%, SN = 24%, SP = 95%, PPV = 78% and NPV = 65%. The best-performing radiomic model provided a bACC = 70%, SN = 77%, SP = 61%, PPV = 60% and NPV = 83% (outperforming the control model, p < 0.05*).

Conclusion: In this study, [68Ga]Ga-DOTATOC PET radiomics allowed to increase diagnostic sensitivity in detecting LN metastases from 24 to 77% in NF-PanNET patients candidate to surgery. Especially in case of micrometastatic involvement, this approach might assist clinicians in a better patients' stratification.

ABSTRACT:
The assessment of gliomas by18F-FDOPA PET imaging as an adjunct to MRI showed high performance by combining static and dynamic features to noninvasively predict the isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutations and the 1p/19q codeletion, which the World Health Organization classified as significant parameters in 2016. The current study evaluated whether other18F-FDOPA PET radiomics features further improve performance and the contributions of each of these features to performance.Methods:Our study included 72 retrospectively selected, newly diagnosed glioma patients with18F-FDOPA PET dynamic acquisitions. A set of 114 features, including conventional static features and dynamic features, as well as other radiomics features, were extracted and machine-learning models trained to predict IDH mutations and the 1p/19q codeletion. Models were based on a machine-learning algorithm built from stable, relevant, and uncorrelated features selected by hierarchic clustering followed by a bootstrapped feature selection process. Models were assessed by comparing area under the curve using a nested cross-validation approach. Feature importance was assessed using Shapley additive explanations values.Results:The best models were able to predict IDH mutations (logistic regression with L2 regularization) and the 1p/19q codeletion (support vector machine with radial basis function kernel) with an area under the curve of 0.831 (95% CI, 0.790-0.873) and 0.724 (95% CI, 0.669-0.782), respectively. For the prediction of IDH mutations, dynamic features were the most important features in the model (time to peak, 35.5%). In contrast, other radiomics features were the most useful for predicting the 1p/19q codeletion (up to 14.5% of importance for the small-zone low-gray-level emphasis).Conclusion:18F-FDOPA PET is an effective tool for the noninvasive prediction of glioma molecular parameters using a full set of amino-acid PET radiomics features. The contribution of each feature set shows the importance of systematically integrating dynamic acquisition for prediction of the IDH mutations as well as developing the use of radiomics features in routine practice for prediction of the 1p/19q codeletion.

TITLE: SwinCross: Cross-modal Swin transformer for head-and-neck tumor segmentation in PET/CT images

AUTHORS: Gary Y Li, Junyu Chen, Se-In Jang, Kuang Gong, Quanzheng Li

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Background: Radiotherapy (RT) combined with cetuximab is the standard treatment for patients with inoperable head and neck cancers. Segmentation of head and neck (H&N) tumors is a prerequisite for radiotherapy planning but a time-consuming process. In recent years, deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) have become the de facto standard for automated image segmentation. However, due to the expensive computational cost associated with enlarging the field of view in DCNNs, their ability to model long-range dependency is still limited, and this can result in sub-optimal segmentation performance for objects with background context spanning over long distances. On the other hand, Transformer models have demonstrated excellent capabilities in capturing such long-range information in several semantic segmentation tasks performed on medical images.

Purpose: Despite the impressive representation capacity of vision transformer models, current vision transformer-based segmentation models still suffer from inconsistent and incorrect dense predictions when fed with multi-modal input data. We suspect that the power of their self-attention mechanism may be limited in extracting the complementary information that exists in multi-modal data. To this end, we propose a novel segmentation model, debuted, Cross-modal Swin Transformer (SwinCross), with cross-modal attention (CMA) module to incorporate cross-modal feature extraction at multiple resolutions.

Methods: We propose a novel architecture for cross-modal 3D semantic segmentation with two main components: (1) a cross-modal 3D Swin Transformer for integrating information from multiple modalities (PET and CT), and (2) a cross-modal shifted window attention block for learning complementary information from the modalities. To evaluate the efficacy of our approach, we conducted experiments and ablation studies on the HECKTOR 2021 challenge dataset. We compared our method against nnU-Net (the backbone of the top-5 methods in HECKTOR 2021) and other state-of-the-art transformer-based models, including UNETR and Swin UNETR. The experiments employed a five-fold cross-validation setup using PET and CT images.

Results: Empirical evidence demonstrates that our proposed method consistently outperforms the comparative techniques. This success can be attributed to the CMA module's capacity to enhance inter-modality feature representations between PET and CT during head-and-neck tumor segmentation. Notably, SwinCross consistently surpasses Swin UNETR across all five folds, showcasing its proficiency in learning multi-modal feature representations at varying resolutions through the cross-modal attention modules.

Conclusions: We introduced a cross-modal Swin Transformer for automating the delineation of head and neck tumors in PET and CT images. Our model incorporates a cross-modality attention module, enabling the exchange of features between modalities at multiple resolutions. The experimental results establish the superiority of our method in capturing improved inter-modality correlations between PET and CT for head-and-neck tumor segmentation. Furthermore, the proposed methodology holds applicability to other semantic segmentation tasks involving different imaging modalities like SPECT/CT or PET/MRI.

TITLE: Performance Characteristics of a New Generation 148-cm Axial Field-of-View uMI Panorama GS PET/CT System with Extended NEMA NU 2-2018 and EARL Standards

AUTHORS: Haiqiong Zhang, Chao Ren, Yu Liu, Xinchun Yan, Meixi Liu, Zhixin Hao, Haiqun Xing, Li Huo

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
The uMI Panorama GS PET/CT system is a new long-axial-field-of-view scanner featuring high sensitivity, time-of-flight (TOF) resolution, spatial resolution, and count rate performance. The aim of this study is to assess the PET system on the basis of the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) NU 2-2018 and European Association of Nuclear Medicine Research Limited (EARL) standards.Methods:Spatial resolution, count rate performance, sensitivity, accuracy, image quality, TOF resolution, and coregistration accuracy were evaluated following the NEMA NU 2-2018 standard. Additional experiments included energy resolution, 200-cm-long line sources for sensitivity, a 175-cm-long scatter phantom for count rate and TOF resolution, as well as the compliance with the EARL guideline. Moreover, an18F-FDG PET patient study was reconstructed with various frame durations.Results:The PET system achieved sub-3-mm transaxial and axial spatial resolutions at a 1-cm radial offset. The sensitivities with the 70-cm-long and 200-cm-long line sources were observed to be 176.3 and 90.8 kcps/MBq, respectively, at the center of the field of view. The noise-equivalent count rates (NECRs) of the 70-cm-long and 175-cm-long scatter phantoms were measured to be 3.35 Mcps at 57.57 kBq/mL and 2.24 Mcps at 33.27 kBq/mL, respectively. The TOF resolutions for both phantoms were approximately 189 ps at 5.3 kBq/mL and lower than 200 ps below the NECR peaks. The absolute count rate errors of all 34 acquisitions were less than 3% below the NECR peak for the 70-cm-long scatter phantom. With the standard NEMA image quality phantom experiment, the contrast recovery coefficient varied from 68.17% to 94.20% and the background variabilities were all below 2%. The maximum PET/CT coregistration error was 1.33 mm. Regarding EARL compliance, the gaussian filter of 5-mm full width at half maximum could produce acceptable images. The patient data demonstrate visually satisfactory image quality with short frames (less than 1 min).Conclusion:The uMI Panorama GS exhibits spatial resolution and TOF resolution similar to those of the uMI Panorama system (35-cm axial field of view), despite the extended axial field of view. The 148-cm axial coverage, sub-200-ps TOF resolution, high sensitivity, and count rate performances are expected to yield superior image quality and offer new opportunities for various clinical applications.

TITLE: Deep-JASC: joint attenuation and scatter correction in whole-body 18F-FDG PET using a deep residual network

AUTHORS: Isaac Shiri, Hossein Arabi, Parham Geramifar, Ghasem Hajianfar, Pardis Ghafarian, Arman Rahmim, Mohammad Reza Ay, Habib Zaidi

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Objective: We demonstrate the feasibility of direct generation of attenuation and scatter-corrected images from uncorrected images (PET-nonASC) using deep residual networks in whole-body18F-FDG PET imaging.

Methods: Two- and three-dimensional deep residual networks using 2D successive slices (DL-2DS), 3D slices (DL-3DS) and 3D patches (DL-3DP) as input were constructed to perform joint attenuation and scatter correction on uncorrected whole-body images in an end-to-end fashion. We included 1150 clinical whole-body18F-FDG PET/CT studies, among which 900, 100 and 150 patients were randomly partitioned into training, validation and independent validation sets, respectively. The images generated by the proposed approach were assessed using various evaluation metrics, including the root-mean-squared-error (RMSE) and absolute relative error (ARE %) using CT-based attenuation and scatter-corrected (CTAC) PET images as reference. PET image quantification variability was also assessed through voxel-wise standardized uptake value (SUV) bias calculation in different regions of the body (head, neck, chest, liver-lung, abdomen and pelvis).

Results: Our proposed attenuation and scatter correction (Deep-JASC) algorithm provided good image quality, comparable with those produced by CTAC. Across the 150 patients of the independent external validation set, the voxel-wise REs (%) were - 1.72 ± 4.22%, 3.75 ± 6.91% and - 3.08 ± 5.64 for DL-2DS, DL-3DS and DL-3DP, respectively. Overall, the DL-2DS approach led to superior performance compared with the other two 3D approaches. The brain and neck regions had the highest and lowest RMSE values between Deep-JASC and CTAC images, respectively. However, the largest ARE was observed in the chest (15.16 ± 3.96%) and liver/lung (11.18 ± 3.23%) regions for DL-2DS. DL-3DS and DL-3DP performed slightly better in the chest region, leading to AREs of 11.16 ± 3.42% and 11.69 ± 2.71%, respectively (p value < 0.05). The joint histogram analysis resulted in correlation coefficients of 0.985, 0.980 and 0.981 for DL-2DS, DL-3DS and DL-3DP approaches, respectively.

Conclusion: This work demonstrated the feasibility of direct attenuation and scatter correction of whole-body18F-FDG PET images using emission-only data via a deep residual network. The proposed approach achieved accurate attenuation and scatter correction without the need for anatomical images, such as CT and MRI. The technique is applicable in a clinical setting on standalone PET or PET/MRI systems. Nevertheless, Deep-JASC showing promising quantitative accuracy, vulnerability to noise was observed, leading to pseudo hot/cold spots and/or poor organ boundary definition in the resulting PET images.

TITLE: Predictive models of epidermal growth factor receptor mutation in lung adenocarcinoma using PET/CT-based radiomics features

AUTHORS: Zhikang Deng, Di Jin, Pei Huang, Changchun Wang, Yaohong Deng, Rong Xu, Bing Fan

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Background: Lung adenocarcinoma (LAC) comprises a substantial subset of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) diagnoses, where epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations play a pivotal role as indicators for therapeutic intervention with targeted agents. The emerging field of radiomics, which involves the extraction of numerous quantitative attributes from medical imaging, when coupled with positron emission tomography/ computed tomography (PET/CT) technology, has demonstrated promise in the prognostication of EGFR mutation status. The objective of this investigation is to construct and validate predictive models for EGFR mutations in LAC by leveraging PET/CT-derived radiomics features, thereby refining diagnostic precision and facilitating tailored treatment strategies.

Purpose: The aim of this study was to develop a non-invasive radiomics model based on PET/CT with excellent performance for predicting the EGFR mutation status in LAC. Thus, it can provide the basis for the individualized treatment decision of patients.

Methods: Positron emission tomography (PET), computed tomography (CT), clinical and pathological data of 112 patients with LAC admitted to our hospital from January 2019 to June 2023 were retrospectively analyzed. This research cohort encompassed 54 LAC patients with EGFR wild type and 58 LAC patients with EGFR mutated type. The participants were randomly assigned to the training group (n = 78) and the validation group (n = 34) in a 7:3 ratio. A sum of 3562 radiomics attributes were derived from PET/CT scans. The minimal absolute shrinkage and selection operator method was employed to identify 13 notable features. Based on these characteristics, support vector machine (SVM), gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT), random forest (RF) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBOOST) were constructed. The forecasting effectiveness of the model was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) Curve, the DeLong test, and decision curve analysis (DCA).

Results: SVM performance in PET/CT radiomics model was higher than that of other machine learning models (training group areas under the curve [AUC] of 0.916 and validation group AUC of 0.945, respectively). The integration of radiomics and clinical data did not yield a superior predictive performance compared to the radiomics model alone in terms of estimating EGFR mutation status (AUC: 0.916 vs. 0.921, 0.945 vs. 0.955, p> 0.05, in both the training and validation groups).

Conclusions: The SVM model has emerged as a commendable non-invasive technique, showing high precision and dependability in forecasting EGFR mutation statuses in individuals with LAC. The radiomics model derived from PET/CT scans holds promise as a prognostic indicator of EGFR mutations in LAC, offering a valuable tool that could refine personalized therapeutic strategies and ultimately enhance the prognosis for LAC patients.

TITLE: PET/MRI Radiomics in Rectal Cancer: a Pilot Study on the Correlation Between PET- and MRI-Derived Image Features with a Clinical Interpretation

AUTHORS: Barbara Juarez Amorim, Angel Torrado-Carvajal, Shadi A Esfahani, Sara S Marcos, Mark Vangel, Dan Stein, David Groshar, Onofrio A Catalano

JOURNAL: Molecular imaging and biology

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: The aim of this study was to explore possible correlations among different imaging features from 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-Glucose positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI) in rectal cancer (RC).

Procedures: RC patients who underwent PET/MRI were enrolled. A region of interest (ROI) was drawn around each primary RC on PET/MRI images (PET, pelvic axial T2w, and apparent diffusion coefficient maps (ADC)). Multiple imaging features were assessed, and Pearson's correlation was used to explore possible correlations among them.

Results: A total of 13 patients were included, mean age 56.1 years old, 6 females. A strong inverse correlation was observed between SUVpeak and ADCmean values, MTV and T2 sphericity, MTV and ADC sphericity, MTV and T2 entropy, and TLG and ADC sphericity. There was also strong direct correlation between PET entropy and ADC sphericity.

Conclusions: In conclusion, several clinically relevant correlations were observed between PET and MRI imaging features. These findings show how the use of both modalities provides complementary information.

TITLE: MR-based truncation correction using an advanced HUGE method to improve attenuation correction in PET/MR imaging of obese patients

AUTHORS: Maike E Lindemann, Marcel Gratz, Jan Ole Blumhagen, Bjoern Jakoby, Harald H Quick

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Truncation artifacts in the periphery of the magnetic resonance (MR) field-of-view (FOV) and thus, in the MR-based attenuation correction (AC) map, may hamper accurate positron emission tomography (PET) quantification in whole-body PET/MR, which is especially problematic in patients with obesity with overall large body dimensions. Therefore, an advanced truncation correction (TC) method to extend the conventional MR FOV is needed.

Methods: The extent of MR-based AC-map truncations in obese patients was determined in a dataset including n = 10 patients that underwent whole-body PET/MR exams. Patient inclusion criteria were defined as BMI > 30 kg/m2and body weight > 100 kg. Truncations in PET/MR patients with obesity were quantified comparing the MR-based AC-map volume to segmented non-AC PET data, serving as the reference body volume without truncations to demonstrate the need of improved TC. The new method implemented in this study, termed "advanced HUGE," was modified and extended from the original HUGE method by Blumhagen et al. in order to provide improved TC across the entire axial MR FOV and to unlock new clinical applications of PET/MR. Advanced HUGE was then systematically tested in PET/MR NEMA phantom measurements. Relative differences between computed tomography (CT) AC PET data of the phantom setup (reference) and MR-based Dixon AC, respectively Dixon + advanced HUGE AC, were calculated. The applicability of the method for advanced TC was then demonstrated in first MR-based measurements in healthy volunteers.

Results: It was found that the MR-based AC maps of obese patients often reveal truncations in the anterior-posterior direction. Especially, the abdominal region could benefit from improved TC, where maximal relative differences in the AC-map volume up to -17% were calculated. Applying advanced HUGE to improve the MR-based AC in PET/MR, PET quantification errors in the large-volume phantom setup could be considerably reduced from average -18.6% (Dixon AC) to 4.6% compared to the CT AC reference. Volunteer measurements demonstrate that formerly missing AC-map volume in the Dixon-VIBE AC-map could be added due to advanced HUGE in the anterior-posterior direction and thus, potentially improves AC in PET/MR.

Conclusions: The advanced HUGE method for truncation correction considerably reduces truncations in the anterior-posterior direction demonstrated in phantom measurements and healthy volunteers and thus, further improves MR-based AC in PET/MR imaging.

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Asymmetries of amyloid-β (Aβ) burden are well known in Alzheimer disease (AD) but did not receive attention in Aβ mouse models of Alzheimer disease. Therefore, we investigated Aβ asymmetries in Aβ mouse models examined by Aβ small-animal PET and tested if such asymmetries have an association with microglial activation.Methods:We analyzed 523 cross-sectional Aβ PET scans of 5 different Aβ mouse models (APP/PS1, PS2APP, APP-SL70,AppNL-G-F, and APPswe) together with 136 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO) PET scans for microglial activation. The asymmetry index (AI) was calculated between tracer uptake in both hemispheres. AIs of Aβ PET were analyzed in correlation with TSPO PET AIs. Extrapolated required sample sizes were compared between analyses of single and combined hemispheres.Results:Relevant asymmetries of Aβ deposition were identified in at least 30% of all investigated mice. There was a significant correlation between AIs of Aβ PET and TSPO PET in 4 investigated Aβ mouse models (APP/PS1:R= 0.593,P= 0.001; PS2APP:R= 0.485,P= 0.019; APP-SL70:R= 0.410,P= 0.037;AppNL-G-F:R= 0.385,P= 0.002). Asymmetry was associated with higher variance of tracer uptake in single hemispheres, leading to higher required sample sizes.Conclusion:Asymmetry of fibrillar plaque neuropathology occurs frequently in Aβ mouse models and acts as a potential confounder in experimental designs. Concomitant asymmetry of microglial activation indicates a neuroinflammatory component to hemispheric predominance of fibrillary amyloidosis.

TITLE: Mitigating the impact of image processing variations on tumour [18F]-FDG-PET radiomic feature robustness

AUTHORS: Syafiq Ramlee, Roido Manavaki, Luigi Aloj, Lorena Escudero Sanchez

JOURNAL: Scientific reports

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Radiomics analysis of [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]-FDG) PET images could be leveraged for personalised cancer medicine. However, the inherent sensitivity of radiomic features to intensity discretisation and voxel interpolation complicates its clinical translation. In this work, we evaluated the robustness of tumour [18F]-FDG-PET radiomic features to 174 different variations in intensity resolution or voxel size, and determined whether implementing parameter range conditions or dependency corrections could improve their robustness. Using 485 patient images spanning three cancer types: non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), melanoma, and lymphoma, we observed features were more sensitive to intensity discretisation than voxel interpolation, especially texture features. In most of our investigations, the majority of non-robust features could be made robust by applying parameter range conditions. Correctable features, which were generally fewer than conditionally robust, showed systematic dependence on bin configuration or voxel size that could be minimised by applying corrections based on simple mathematical equations. Melanoma images exhibited limited robustness and correctability relative to NSCLC and lymphoma. Our study provides an in-depth characterisation of the sensitivity of [18F]-FDG-PET features to image processing variations and reinforces the need for careful selection of imaging biomarkers prior to any clinical application.

AUTHORS: John P Crandall, Tyler J Fraum, MinYoung Lee, Linda Jiang, Perry Grigsby, Richard L Wahl

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Knowledge of the intrinsic variability of radiomic features is essential to the proper interpretation of changes in these features over time. The primary aim of this study was to assess the test-retest repeatability of radiomic features extracted from18F-FDG PET images of cervical tumors. The impact of different image preprocessing methods was also explored.Methods:Patients with cervical cancer underwent baseline and repeat18F-FDG PET/CT imaging within 7 d. PET images were reconstructed using 2 methods: ordered-subset expectation maximization (PETOSEM) or ordered-subset expectation maximization with point-spread function (PETPSF). Tumors were segmented to produce whole-tumor volumes of interest (VOIWT) and 40% isocontours (VOI40). Voxels were either left at the default size or resampled to 3-mm isotropic voxels. SUV was discretized to a fixed number of bins (32, 64, or 128). Radiomic features were extracted from both VOIs, and repeatability was then assessed using the Lin concordance correlation coefficient (CCC).Results:Eleven patients were enrolled and completed the test-retest PET/CT imaging protocol. Shape, neighborhood gray-level difference matrix, and gray-level cooccurrence matrix features were repeatable, with a mean CCC value of 0.81. Radiomic features extracted from PETOSEMimages showed significantly better repeatability than features extracted from PETPSFimages (P< 0.001). Radiomic features extracted from VOI40were more repeatable than features extracted from VOIWT(P< 0.001). For most features (78.4%), a change in bin number or voxel size resulted in less than a 10% change in feature value. All gray-level emphasis and gray-level run emphasis features showed poor repeatability (CCC values < 0.52) when extracted from VOIWTbut were highly repeatable (mean CCC values > 0.96) when extracted from VOI40Conclusion:Shape, gray-level cooccurrence matrix, and neighborhood gray-level difference matrix radiomic features were consistently repeatable, whereas gray-level run length matrix and gray-level zone length matrix features were highly variable. Radiomic features extracted from VOI40were more repeatable than features extracted from VOIWTChanges in voxel size or SUV discretization parameters typically resulted in relatively small differences in feature value, though several features were highly sensitive to these changes.

TITLE: Brain structural changes in CADASIL patients: A morphometric magnetic resonance imaging study

AUTHORS: Hui Pan, Qi Huang, Shiyu Ban, Xiaoxia Du, Jingjing Su, Jianren Liu

JOURNAL: Neuroscience letters

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Background: Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is a subcortical, inherited, cerebral small vessel disease. Several studies have revealed the involvement of specific cortical regions. However, the structural brain alterations and their clinical correlations remain largely undetermined.

Methods: We evaluated 22 CADASIL patients and 22 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. We used surface- and voxel-based morphometric data derived from 3.0-T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to explore structural changes in gray and white matter. We calculated Pearson correlations between such data and clinical and MRI metrics.

Results: Compared with controls, CADASIL patients exhibited significantly decreased cortical thickness in the left supramarginal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, transverse temporal gyrus, insula, lateral orbitofrontal gyrus, isthmus cingulate gyrus and precentral gyrus. An extensive decrease in the white (but not gray) matter volume was also evident, predominantly in the frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes. The number of previous strokes or transient ischemic attacks was negatively associated with the cortical thickness of the left pars opercularis and right posterior cingulate gyrus.

Conclusion: Reductions in cortical thickness and white matter volume were evident in CADASIL patients compared with controls, and higher numbers of strokes and transient ischemic attacks were associated with regional cortical thinning.

ABSTRACT:
Objective: Technological innovations in single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) have enabled a more accurate quantitative evaluation of the uptake, and the standardized uptake value (SUV) can be measured as a semi-quantitative value, as in positron emission tomography. Nevertheless, the reliability of the SUV of bone SPECT has not been well established. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the test-retest repeatability of the SUV of bone SPECT/CT in clinical settings.

Methods: This prospective study recruited patients with prostate cancer planning to receive bone SPECT/CT for the evaluation of bone abnormality between August 2017 and September 2019. Bone images were acquired twice by an integrated SPECT/CT scanner (Symbia Intevo, Siemens) within a 4- to 10-day interval. The maximum SUV (SUVmax) and peak SUV (SUVpeak) were calculated for the volumes of interests on the normal bone areas, degeneration/fracture lesions, and metastatic lesions. To determine repeatability, we calculated statistical indicators, including intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), repeatability coefficient (RC), and mean absolute percentage difference (MAPD). For the ICC, the 95% confidential interval (CI) was also calculated, and an ICC of ≥ 0.8 was defined as an almost perfect correlation.

Results: Twelve male patients were enrolled in the study (58-86 years; median, 71 years), and a total of 229 volumes of the interest were included in the analyses. The ICCs were 0.968 [95% CI (0.959, 0.975)] for SUVmax and 0.976 [95% CI (0.969, 0.981)] for SUVpeak. The RCs of the relative difference were 30.7% for SUVmax and 27.6% for SUVpeak, and the MAPDs (± standardized deviation) of all lesions were 12.3 ± 9.9% for SUVmax and 11.5 ± 8.3% for SUVpeak. The RCs and the MAPDs showed comparable value with the previous report regarding repeatability studies on PET.

Conclusion: An almost perfect correlation was demonstrated by repeated SUVmax and SUVpeak measured by quantitative integrated SPECT/CT. The quantitative values could be reliable indicators in patient management.

JOURNAL: Annals of nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Objective: To enhance amyloid-β (Aβ) positron emission tomography (PET) diagnostic accuracy and adjust for tracer differences, the amyloid-β load (AβL) and centiloid (CL) scale were developed. However, the correlation and superiority of these indicators remain unclear. This study aimed to elucidate the correlation and determine cutoff values.

Methods: Data from 281 consecutive participants (144 males; mean age, 69.6 years) in the Parkinson's and Alzheimer's Disease Dimensional Neuroimaging Initiative study were analyzed. Initial data, including Aβ PET, structural MRI, and Global Clinical Dementia Rating (G-CDR) scores, were reviewed. CL was calculated using the cerebral cortical and striatum Volume of Interest templates (VOI) and whole cerebellum VOI. AβLwas calculated using voxel-wise regression with two canonical images representing non-displaceable and specific binding. Visual estimation was performed by five radiologists, with two independently classify as visual-only Aβ-negative or Aβ-positive. The discrepancies were resolved through majority consensus involving a third observer. Additional visual estimation was performed for cases with CL value under 10 but visual-only Aβ-positive, and those over 30 but Aβ-negative, by two nuclear medicine radiologists. The discrepancies were resolved through discussion and classify as final Aβ diagnosis negative or positive.

Results: CL and AβLcorrelated linearly (CL = AβL× 2.10-9.40, R2= 0.923). In predicting final Aβ diagnosis negative versus positive, both CL (AUC = 0.996) and AβL(AUC = 0.997) were significant, with no significant differences (P = 0.882). The Youden Index was 23.3 for CL and 15.6 for AβL. In predicting cognitively normal participants (G-CDR = 0) from others, both CL (AUC = 0.687) and AβL(AUC = 0.667) were significant, with no significant differences (P = 0.379). The Youden Index was 11.9 for CL and 11.6 for AβL. Using a non-biased Gaussian mixture model, the normal group's mean and SD were -2.5 (SD = 6.5) for CL and 3.7 (SD = 3.0) for AβL, resulting in 95% limits (mean + 2SD) of 10.4 for CL and 9.7 for AβL.

Conclusions: This study demonstrated a high correlation and non-inferiority between CL and AβL.

ABSTRACT:
The purpose of this study was to examine a nonparametric approach to mapping kinetic parameters and their uncertainties with data from the emerging generation of dynamic whole-body PET/CT scanners.Methods:Dynamic PET18F-FDG data from a set of 24 cancer patients studied on a long-axial-field-of-view PET/CT scanner were considered. Kinetics were mapped using a nonparametric residue mapping (NPRM) technique. Uncertainties were evaluated using an image-based bootstrapping methodology. Kinetics and bootstrap-derived uncertainties are reported for voxels, maximum-intensity projections, and volumes of interest (VOIs) corresponding to several key organs and lesions. Comparisons between NPRM and standard 2-compartment (2C) modeling of VOI kinetics are carefully examined.Results:NPRM-generated kinetic maps were of good quality and well aligned with vascular and metabolic18F-FDG patterns, reasonable for the range of VOIs considered. On a single 3.2-GHz processor, the specification of the bootstrapping model took 140 min; individual bootstrap replicates required 80 min each. VOI time-course data were much more accurately represented, particularly in the early time course, by NPRM than by 2C modeling constructs, and improvements in fit were statistically highly significant. Although18F-FDG flux values evaluated by NPRM and 2C modeling were generally similar, significant deviations between vascular blood and distribution volume estimates were found. The bootstrap enables the assessment of quite complex summaries of mapped kinetics. This is illustrated with maximum-intensity maps of kinetics and their uncertainties.Conclusion:NPRM kinetics combined with image-domain bootstrapping is practical with large whole-body dynamic18F-FDG datasets. The information provided by bootstrapping could support more sophisticated uses of PET biomarkers used in clinical decision-making for the individual patient.

TITLE: Estimation of optimal number of gates in dual gated 18F-FDG cardiac PET

AUTHORS: R Klén, J Teuho, T Noponen, K Thielemans, E Hoppela, E Lehtonen, H T Sipila, M Teräs, J Knuuti

JOURNAL: Scientific reports

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Gating of positron emission tomography images has been shown to reduce the motion effects, especially when imaging small targets, such as coronary plaques. However, the selection of optimal number of gates for gating remains a challenge. Selecting too high number of gates results in a loss of signal-to-noise ratio, while too low number of gates does remove only part of the motion. Here, we introduce a respiratory-cardiac motion model to determine the optimal number of respiratory and cardiac gates. We evaluate the model using a realistic heart phantom and data from 12 cardiac patients (47-77 years, 64.5 on average). To demonstrate the benefits of our model, we compared it with an existing respiratory model. Based on our study, the optimal number of gates was determined to be five respiratory and four cardiac gates in the phantom and patient studies. In the phantom study, the diameter of the most active hot spot was reduced by 24% in the dual gated images compared to non-gated images. In the patient study, the thickness of myocardium wall was reduced on average by 21%. In conclusion, the motion model can be used for estimating the optimal number of respiratory and cardiac gates for dual gating.

TITLE: Value of multi-center 18F-FDG PET/CT radiomics in predicting EGFR mutation status in lung adenocarcinoma

AUTHORS: Yan Zuo, Liu Liu, Cheng Chang, Hui Yan, Lihua Wang, Dazhen Sun, Maomei Ruan, Bei Lei, Xunpeng Xia, Wenhui Xie, Shaoli Song, Gang Huang

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Background: Accurate, noninvasive, and reliable assessment of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation status and EGFR molecular subtypes is essential for treatment plan selection and individualized therapy in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Radiomics models based on18F-FDG PET/CT have great potential in identifying EGFR mutation status and EGFR subtypes in patients with LUAD. The validation of multi-center data, model visualization, and interpretation are significantly important for the management, application and trust of machine learning predictive models. However, few EGFR-related research involved model visualization and interpretation, and multi-center trial.

Purpose: To develop explainable optimal predictive models based on handcrafted radiomics features (HRFs) extracted from multi-center18F-FDG PET/CT to predict EGFR mutation status and molecular subtypes in LUAD.

Methods: Baseline18F-FDG PET/CT images of 383 LUAD patients from three hospitals and one public data set were collected. Further, 1808 HRFs were extracted from the primary tumor regions using Pyradiomics. Predictive models were built based on cross-combination of seven feature selection methods and seven machine learning algorithms. Yellowbrick and explainable artificial intelligence technology were used for model visualization and interpretation. Receiver operating characteristic curve, classification report and confusion matrix were used for model performance evaluation. Clinical applicability of the optimal models was assessed by decision curve analysis.

Results: STACK feature selection method combined with light gradient boosting machine (LGBM) reached optimal performance in identifying EGFR mutation status ([area under the curve] AUC = 0.81 in the internal test cohort; AUC = 0.62 in the external test cohort). Random forest feature selection method combined with LGBM reached optimal performance in predicting EGFR mutation molecular subtypes (AUC = 0.89 in the internal test cohort; AUC = 0.61 in the external test cohort).

Conclusions: Explainable machine learning models combined with radiomics features extracted from multi-center/scanner18F-FDG PET/CT have certain potential to identify EGFR mutation status and subtypes in LUAD, which might be helpful to the treatment of LUAD.

TITLE: Technical feasibility of novel immunostimulatory low-dose radiation for polymetastatic disease with CBCT-based online adaptive and conventional approaches

AUTHORS: Nour Nasser, Bradford A Perez, Jose A Penagaricano, Jimmy J Caudell, Daniel E Oliver, Kujtim Latifi, Eduardo G Moros, Gage Redler

JOURNAL: Journal of applied clinical medical physics

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: A workflow/planning strategy delivering low-dose radiation therapy (LDRT) (1 Gy) to all polymetastatic diseases using conventional planning/delivery (Raystation/Halcyon = "conventional") and the AI-based Ethos online adaptive RT (oART) platform is developed/evaluated.

Methods: Using retrospective data for ten polymetastatic non-small cell lung cancer patients (5-52 lesions each) with PET/CTs, gross tumor volumes (GTVs) were delineated using PET standardized-uptake-value (SUV) thresholding. A 1 cm uniform expansion of GTVs to account for setup/contour uncertainty and organ motion-generated planning target volumes (PTVs). Dose optimization/calculation used the diagnostic CT from PET/CT. Dosimetric objectives were: Dmin,0.03cc≥ 95% (acceptable variation (Δ) ≥ 90%), V100%≥ 95% (Δ ≥ 90%), and D0.03cc≤ 120% (Δ ≤ 125%). Additionally, online adaptation was simulated. When available, subsequent diagnostic CT was used to represent on-treatment CBCT. Otherwise, the CT from PET/CT used for initial planning was deformed to simulate clinically representative changes.

Results: All initial plans generated, both for Raystation and Ethos, achieved clinical goals within acceptable variation. For all patients, Dmin,0.03cc≥ 95%, V100%≥ 95%, and D0.03cc≤ 120% goals were achieved for 84.8%/99.5%, 97.7%/98.7%, 97.4%/92.3%, in conventional/Ethos plans, respectively. The ratio of 50% isodose volume to PTV volume (R50%), maximum dose at 2 cm from PTV (D2cm), and the ratio of the 100% isodose volume to PTV volume (conformity index) in Raystation/Ethos plans were 7.9/5.9; 102.3%/88.44%; and 0.99/1.01, respectively. In Ethos, online adapted plans maintained PTV coverage whereas scheduled plans often resulted in geographic misses due to changes in tumor size, patient position, and body habitus. The average total duration of the oART workflow was 26:15 (min:sec) ranging from 6:43 to 57:30. The duration of each oART workflow step as a function of a number of targets showed a low correlation coefficient for influencer generation and editing (R2= 0.04 and 0.02, respectively) and high correlation coefficient for target generation, target editing and plan generation (R2= 0.68, 0.63 and 0.69, respectively).

Conclusions: This study demonstrates feasibility of conventional planning/treatment with Raystation/Halcyon and highlights efficiency gains when utilizing semi-automated planning/online-adaptive treatment with Ethos for immunostimulatory LDRT conformally delivered to all sites of polymetastatic disease.

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have emerged as transformative tools in the field of radiation oncology, significantly advancing the precision of contouring practices. However, the adaptability of these algorithms across diverse scanners, institutions, and imaging protocols remains a considerable obstacle. This study aims to investigate the effects of incorporating institution-specific datasets into the training regimen of CNNs to assess their generalization ability in real-world clinical environments. Focusing on a data-centric analysis, the influence of varying multi- and single center training approaches on algorithm performance is conducted.

Methods: nnU-Net is trained using a dataset comprising 16118F-PSMA-1007 PET images collected from four distinct institutions (Freiburg: n = 96, Munich: n = 19, Cyprus: n = 32, Dresden: n = 14). The dataset is partitioned such that data from each center are systematically excluded from training and used solely for testing to assess the model's generalizability and adaptability to data from unfamiliar sources. Performance is compared through a 5-Fold Cross-Validation, providing a detailed comparison between models trained on datasets from single centers to those trained on aggregated multi-center datasets. Dice Similarity Score, Hausdorff distance and volumetric analysis are used as primary evaluation metrics.

Results: The mixed training approach yielded a median DSC of 0.76 (IQR: 0.64-0.84) in a five-fold cross-validation, showing no significant differences (p = 0.18) compared to models trained with data exclusion from each center, which performed with a median DSC of 0.74 (IQR: 0.56-0.86). Significant performance improvements regarding multi-center training were observed for the Dresden cohort (multi-center median DSC 0.71, IQR: 0.58-0.80 vs. single-center 0.68, IQR: 0.50-0.80, p < 0.001) and Cyprus cohort (multi-center 0.74, IQR: 0.62-0.83 vs. single-center 0.72, IQR: 0.54-0.82, p < 0.01). While Munich and Freiburg also showed performance improvements with multi-center training, results showed no statistical significance (Munich: multi-center DSC 0.74, IQR: 0.60-0.80 vs. single-center 0.72, IQR: 0.59-0.82, p > 0.05; Freiburg: multi-center 0.78, IQR: 0.53-0.87 vs. single-center 0.71, IQR: 0.53-0.83, p = 0.23).

Conclusion: CNNs trained for auto contouring intraprostatic GTV in18F-PSMA-1007 PET on a diverse dataset from multiple centers mostly generalize well to unseen data from other centers. Training on a multicentric dataset can improve performance compared to training exclusively with a single-center dataset regarding intraprostatic18F-PSMA-1007 PET GTV segmentation. The segmentation performance of the same CNN can vary depending on the dataset employed for training and testing.

TITLE: A survey among German-speaking radiation oncologists on PET-based radiotherapy of prostate cancer

AUTHORS: Marco M E Vogel, Sabrina Dewes, Eva K Sage, Michal Devecka, Jürgen E Gschwend, Matthias Eiber, Stephanie E Combs, Kilian Schiller

JOURNAL: Radiation oncology (London, England)

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Background: Positron emission tomography-(PET) has evolved as a powerful tool to guide treatment for prostate cancer (PC). The aim of this survey was to evaluate the acceptance and use of PET-especially with prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) targeting tracers-in clinical routine for radiotherapy (RT) and the impact on target volume definition and dose prescription.

Methods: We developed an online survey, which we distributed via e-mail to members of the German Society of Radiation Oncology (DEGRO). The survey included questions on patterns of care of RT for PC with/without PET. For evaluation of doses we used the equivalent dose at fractionation of 2 Gy with α/β = 1.5 Gy [EQD2(1.5 Gy)].

Results: From 109 participants, 78.9% have the possibility to use PET for RT planning. Most centers use PSMA-targeting tracers (98.8%). In 39.5%, PSMA-PET for biochemical relapse after prior surgery is initiated at PSA ≥ 0.5 ng/mL, while 30.2% will perform PET at ≥ 0.2 ng/mL (≥ 1.0 ng/mL: 16.3%, ≥ 2.0 ng/mL: 2.3%, regardless of PSA: 11.7%). In case of PET-positive local recurrence (LR) and pelvic lymph nodes (LNs), 97.7% and 96.5% of the participants will apply an escalated dose. The median total dose in EQD2(1.5 Gy) was 70.00 Gy (range: 56.89-85.71) for LR and 62.00 Gy (range: 52.61-80.00) for LNs. A total number of ≤ 3 (22.0%) or ≤ 5 (20.2%) distant lesions was most often described as applicable for the definition as oligometastatic PC.

Conclusion: PSMA-PET is widely used among German radiation oncologists. However, specific implications on treatment planning differ among physicians. Therefore, further trials and guidelines for PET-based RT are warranted.

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: To investigate the [68Ga]DOTATOC PET radiomic profile of head and neck paragangliomas (HNPGLs) and identify radiomic characteristics useful as predictors of succinate dehydrogenase genes (SDHx) pathogenic variants.

Methods: Sporadic and SDHx HNPGL patients, who underwent [68Ga]DOTATOC PET/CT, were retrospectively included. HNPGLs were analyzed using LIFEx software, and extracted features were harmonized to correct for batch effects and confronted testing for multiple comparison. Stepwise discriminant analysis was conducted to remove redundancy and identify best discriminating features. ROC analysis was used to define optimal cut-offs. Multivariate decision-tree analysis was performed using CHAID method.

Results: 34 patients harboring 60 HNPGLs (51 SDHx in 25 patients) were included. Three sporadic and nine SDHx HNPGLs were metastatic. At stepwise discriminant analysis, both GLSZM-Zone Size Non-Uniformity (ZSNU, reflecting tumor heterogeneity) and IB-TLSRE (total lesion somatostatin receptor expression) were independent predictors of genetic status, with 96.4% of lesions and 91.6% of patients correctly classified after cross validation (p < 0.001). Among non-metastatic patients, GLSZM-ZSNU and IB-TLSRE were significantly higher in sporadic than SDHx HNPGLs (p < 0.001). No differences were revealed in metastatic patients. Decision-tree analysis highlights multifocality and IB-TLSRE as useful variables, correctly identifying 6/9 sporadic and 24/25 SDHx patients. Model failed to classify one SDHA and three sporadic patients (2 metastatic).

Conclusion: Radiomics features GLSZM-ZSNU and IB-TLSRE appear to reflect HNPGLs SDHx status and tumor behavior (metastatic vs. non-metastatic). If validated, especially IB-TLSRE might represent a simple and time-efficient radiomic index for SDHx variants early screening and prediction of tumor behavior in HNPGL cases.

TITLE: Automatic detection of primary and metastatic lesions on cervicothoracic region and whole-body bone using a uniform machine-learnable approach for [18F]-FDG-PET/CT image analysis

AUTHORS: Mitsutaka Nemoto, Atsuko Tanaka, Hayato Kaida, Yuichi Kimura, Takashi Nagaoka, Takahiro Yamada, Kohei Hanaoka, Kazuhiro Kitajima, Tatsuya Tsuchitani, Kazunari Ishii

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
We propose a method to detect primary and metastatic lesions with Fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) accumulation in the lung field, neck, mediastinum, and bony regions on the FDG-PET/CT images. To search for systemic lesions, various anatomical structures must be considered. The proposed method is addressed by using an extraction process for anatomical regions and a uniform lesion detection approach. The uniform approach does not utilize processes that reflect any region-specific anatomical aspects but has a machine-learnable framework. Therefore, it can work as a lesion detection process for a specific anatomical region if it machine-learns the specific region data. In this study, three lesion detection processes for the whole-body bone region, lung field, or neck-mediastinum region are obtained. These detection processes include lesion candidate detection and false positive (FP) candidate elimination. The lesion candidate detection is based on a voxel anomaly detection with a one-class support vector machine. The FP candidate elimination is performed using an AdaBoost classifier ensemble. The image features used by the ensemble are selected sequentially during training and are optimal for candidate classification. Three-fold cross-validation was used to detect performance with the 54 diseased FDG-PET/CT images. The mean sensitivity for detecting primary and metastatic lesions at 3 FPs per case was 0.89 with a 0.10 standard deviation (SD) in the bone region, 0.80 with a 0.10 SD in the lung field, and 0.87 with a 0.10 SD in the neck region. The average areas under the ROC curve were 0.887 with a 0.125 SD for detecting bone metastases, 0.900 with a 0.063 SD for detecting pulmonary lesions, and 0.927 with a 0.035 SD for detecting the neck-mediastinum lesions. These detection performances indicate that the proposed method could be applied clinically. These results also show that the uniform approach has high versatility for providing various lesion detection processes.

TITLE: Cherenkov emissions for studying tumor changes during radiation therapy: An exploratory study in domesticated dogs with naturally-occurring cancer

AUTHORS: Ashlyn G Rickard, Hiroto Yoshikawa, Gregory M Palmer, Harrison Q Liu, Mark W Dewhirst, Michael W Nolan, Xiaofeng Zhang

JOURNAL: PloS one

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Real-time monitoring of physiological changes of tumor tissue during radiation therapy (RT) could improve therapeutic efficacy and predict therapeutic outcomes. Cherenkov radiation is a normal byproduct of radiation deposited in tissue. Previous studies in rat tumors have confirmed a correlation between Cherenkov emission spectra and optical measurements of blood-oxygen saturation based on the tissue absorption coefficients. The purpose of this study is to determine if it is feasible to image Cherenkov emissions during radiation therapy in larger human-sized tumors of pet dogs with cancer. We also wished to validate the prior work in rats, to determine if Cherenkov emissions have the potential to act an indicator of blood-oxygen saturation or water-content changes in the tumor tissue-both of which have been correlated with patient prognosis.

Methods: A DoseOptics camera, built to image the low-intensity emission of Cherenkov radiation, was used to measure Cherenkov intensities in a cohort of cancer-bearing pet dogs during clinical irradiation. Tumor type and location varied, as did the radiation fractionation scheme and beam arrangement, each planned according to institutional standard-of-care. Unmodulated radiation was delivered using multiple 6 MV X-ray beams from a clinical linear accelerator. Each dog was treated with a minimum of 16 Gy total, in ≥3 fractions. Each fraction was split into at least three subfractions per gantry angle. During each subfraction, Cherenkov emissions were imaged.

Results: We documented significant intra-subfraction differences between the Cherenkov intensities for normal tissue, whole-tumor tissue, tissue at the edge of the tumor and tissue at the center of the tumor (p<0.05). Additionally, intra-subfraction changes suggest that Cherenkov emissions may have captured fluctuating absorption properties within the tumor.

Conclusion: Here we demonstrate that it is possible to obtain Cherenkov emissions from canine cancers within a fraction of radiotherapy. The entire optical spectrum was obtained which includes the window for imaging changes in water and hemoglobin saturation. This lends credence to the goal of using this method during radiotherapy in human patients and client-owned pets.

TITLE: Automated Lung Cancer Segmentation Using a PET and CT Dual-Modality Deep Learning Neural Network

AUTHORS: Siqiu Wang, Rebecca Mahon, Elisabeth Weiss, Nuzhat Jan, Ross James Taylor, Philip Reed McDonagh, Bridget Quinn, Lulin Yuan

JOURNAL: International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: To develop an automated lung tumor segmentation method for radiation therapy planning based on deep learning and dual-modality positron emission tomography (PET) and computed tomography (CT) images.

Methods and materials: A 3-dimensional (3D) convolutional neural network using inputs from diagnostic PETs and simulation CTs was constructed with 2 parallel convolution paths for independent feature extraction at multiple resolution levels and a single deconvolution path. At each resolution level, the extracted features from the convolution arms were concatenated and fed through the skip connections into the deconvolution path that produced the tumor segmentation. Our network was trained/validated/tested by a 3:1:1 split on 290 pairs of PET and CT images from patients with lung cancer treated at our clinic, with manual physician contours as the ground truth. A stratified training strategy based on the magnitude of the gross tumor volume (GTV) was investigated to improve performance, especially for small tumors. Multiple radiation oncologists assessed the clinical acceptability of the network-produced segmentations.

Results: The mean Dice similarity coefficient, Hausdorff distance, and bidirectional local distance comparing manual versus automated contours were 0.79 ± 0.10, 5.8 ± 3.2 mm, and 2.8 ± 1.5 mm for the unstratified 3D dual-modality model. Stratification delivered the best results when the model for the large GTVs (>25 mL) was trained with all-size GTVs and the model for the small GTVs (<25 mL) was trained with small GTVs only. The best combined Dice similarity coefficient, Hausdorff distance, and bidirectional local distance from the 2 stratified models on their corresponding test data sets were 0.83 ± 0.07, 5.9 ± 2.5 mm, and 2.8 ± 1.4 mm, respectively. In the multiobserver review, 91.25% manual versus 88.75% automatic contours were accepted or accepted with modifications.

Conclusions: By using an expansive clinical PET and CT image database and a dual-modality architecture, the proposed 3D network with a novel GTVbased stratification strategy generated clinically useful lung cancer contours that were highly acceptable on physician review.

JOURNAL: Theranostics

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Rationale:The heterogeneous nature of gliomas makes the development and application of novel treatments challenging. In particular, infiltrating myeloid cells play a role in tumor progression and therapy resistance. Hence, a detailed understanding of the dynamic interplay of tumor cells and immune cellsin vivois necessary. To investigate the complex interaction between tumor progression and therapy-induced changes in the myeloid immune component of the tumor microenvironment, we used a combination of [18F]FET (amino acid metabolism) and [18F]DPA-714 (TSPO, GAMMs, tumor cells, astrocytes, endothelial cells) PET/MRI together with immune-phenotyping. The aim of the study was to monitor temozolomide (TMZ) treatment response and therapy-induced changes in the inflammatory tumor microenvironment (TME).Methods:Eighteen NMRInu/numice orthotopically implanted with Gli36dEGFR cells underwent MRI and PET/CT scans before and after treatment with TMZ or DMSO (vehicle). Tumor-to-background (striatum) uptake ratios were calculated and areas of unique tracer uptake (FET vs. DPA) were determined using an atlas-based volumetric approach.Results:TMZ therapy significantly modified the spatial distribution and uptake of both tracers. [18F]FET uptake was significantly reduced after therapy (-53 ± 84%) accompanied by a significant decrease of tumor volume (-17 ± 6%). In contrast, a significant increase (61 ± 33%) of [18F]DPA-714 uptake was detected by TSPO imaging in specific areas of the tumor. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) validated the reduction in tumor volumes and further revealed the presence of reactive TSPO-expressing glioma-associated microglia/macrophages (GAMMs) in the TME.Conclusion:We confirm the efficiency of [18F]FET-PET for monitoring TMZ-treatment response and demonstrate thatin vivoTSPO-PET performed with [18F]DPA-714 can be used to identify specific reactive areas of myeloid cell infiltration in the TME.

TITLE: Features of IgG4-related lung disease on 18F-FDG PET/computed tomography imaging

AUTHORS: Jie Xiao, Bingxin Hu, Dengfeng Cheng, Hongcheng Shi, Yan Xiu

JOURNAL: Nuclear medicine communications

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Objectives: The aim of the study was to summarize the features of immunoglobulin G4-related lung disease (IgG4-RLD) on fluorine 18-fluorodeoxyglucose (F-FDG) PET/computed tomography (CT).

Methods: In this retrospective case series, 12 consecutive patients (9 men and 3 women, mean age 55.4 ± 13.7 years) with IgG4-RLD were included. The clinicopathological information and features of F-FDG PET/CT imaging were analyzed.

Results: Six (50%) patients had pulmonary involvement alone and six (50%) patients had extrapulmonary involvement with intense F-FDG uptake. Pulmonary manifestations included mass (25%, 3/12), solid nodule (solitary 25%, 3/12; multiple 50%, 6/12), multiple ground-glass opacities (GGOs) (50%, 6/12), thickening of alveolar interstitium (50%, 6/12), and thickening of bronchovascular bundle (33.3%, 4/12). The maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of the solid nodules and masses, multiple GGOs, bronchovascular bundle and the thickening of septa was 4.0 ± 2.5, 2.3 ± 1.8, 1.4 ± 0.6, and 0.9 ± 0.5, respectively. The SUVmax statistically significant linear association with the diameter of masses or solid nodules (P value = 0.03), but no significant inverse linear association (P value = 0.06) with the concentration of serum IgG4 concentration.

Conclusions: The image patterns of IgG4-RLD on F-FDG PET/CT are varying. Multiple pulmonary manifestations or multiple organ involvement, especially in combination with elevated levels of serum IgG and IgG4, may help to make the diagnosis. A potential major application of PET-CT would be evaluation of response to treatment, and the impact of PET/CT on IgG4-RLD management is worth investigating further in the future.

TITLE: CT-guided spatial normalization of nuclear hybrid imaging adapted to enlarged ventricles: Impact on striatal uptake quantification

AUTHORS: El Barkaoui Alae Eddine, Christian Scheiber, Thomas Grenier, Marc Janier, Anthime Flaus

JOURNAL: NeuroImage

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Introduction: Spatial normalization is a prerequisite step for the quantitative analysis of SPECT or PET brain images using volume-of-interest (VOI) template or voxel-based analysis. MRI-guided spatial normalization is the gold standard, but the wide use of PET/CT or SPECT/CT in routine clinical practice makes CT-guided spatial normalization a necessary alternative. Ventricular enlargement is observed with aging, and it hampers the spatial normalization of the lateral ventricles and striatal regions, limiting their analysis. The aim of the present study was to propose a robust spatial normalization method based on CT scans that takes into account features of the aging brain to reduce bias in the CT-guided striatal analysis of SPECT images.

Methods: We propose an enhanced CT-guided spatial normalization pipeline based on SPM12. Performance of the proposed pipeline was assessed on visually normal [123I]-FP-CIT SPECT/CT images. SPM12 default CT-guided spatial normalization was used as reference method. The metrics assessed were the overlap between the spatially normalized lateral ventricles and caudate/putamen VOIs, and the computation of caudate and putamen specific binding ratios (SBR).

Results: In total 231 subjects (mean age ± SD = 61.9 ± 15.5 years) were included in the statistical analysis. The mean overlap between the spatially normalized lateral ventricles of subjects and the caudate VOI and the mean SBR of caudate were respectively 38.40 % (± SD = 19.48 %) of the VOI and 1.77 (± 0.79) when performing SPM12 default spatial normalization. The mean overlap decreased to 9.13 % (± SD = 1.41 %, P < 0.001) of the VOI and the SBR of caudate increased to 2.38 (± 0.51, P < 0.0001) when performing the proposed pipeline. Spatially normalized lateral ventricles did not overlap with putamen VOI using either method. The mean putamen SBR value derived from the proposed spatial normalization (2.75 ± 0.54) was not significantly different from that derived from the default SPM12 spatial normalization (2.83 ± 0.52, P > 0.05).

Conclusion: The automatic CT-guided spatial normalization used herein led to a less biased spatial normalization of SPECT images, hence an improved semi-quantitative analysis. The proposed pipeline could be implemented in clinical routine to perform a more robust SBR computation using hybrid imaging.

TITLE: Feasibility evaluation of PET scan-time reduction for diagnosing amyloid-β levels in Alzheimer's disease patients using a deep-learning-based denoising algorithm

AUTHORS: Zhao Peng, Ming Ni, Hongming Shan, Yu Lu, Yongzhe Li, Yifan Zhang, Xi Pei, Zhi Chen, Qiang Xie, Shicun Wang, X George Xu

JOURNAL: Computers in biology and medicine

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: To shorten positron emission tomography (PET) scanning time in diagnosing amyloid-β levels thus increasing the workflow in centers involving Alzheimer's Disease (AD) patients.

Methods: PET datasets were collected for 25 patients injected with18F-AV45 radiopharmaceutical. To generate necessary training data, PET images from both normal-scanning-time (20-min) as well as so-called "shortened-scanning-time" (1-min, 2-min, 5-min, and 10-min) were reconstructed for each patient. Building on our earlier work on MCDNet (Monte Carlo Denoising Net) and a new Wasserstein-GAN algorithm, we developed a new denoising model called MCDNet-2 to predict normal-scanning-time PET images from a series of shortened-scanning-time PET images. The quality of the predicted PET images was quantitatively evaluated using objective metrics including normalized-root-mean-square-error (NRMSE), structural similarity (SSIM), and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). Furthermore, two radiologists performed subjective evaluations including the qualitative evaluation and a five-point grading evaluation. The denoising performance of the proposed MCDNet-2 was finally compared with those of U-Net, MCDNet, and a traditional denoising method called Gaussian Filtering.

Results: The proposed MCDNet-2 can yield good denoising performance in 5-min PET images. In the comparison of denoising methods, MCDNet-2 yielded the best performance in the subjective evaluation although it is comparable with MCDNet in objective comparison (NRMSE, PSNR, and SSIM). In the qualitative evaluation of amyloid-β positive or negative results, MCDNet-2 was found to achieve a classification accuracy of 100%.

Conclusions: The proposed denoising method has been found to reduce the PET scan time from the normal level of 20 min to 5 min but still maintaining acceptable image quality in correctly diagnosing amyloid-β levels. These results suggest strongly that deep learning-based methods such as ours can be an attractive solution to the clinical needs to improve PET imaging workflow.

TITLE: Internal validation of myocardial flow reserve PET imaging using stress/rest myocardial activity ratios with Rb-82 and N-13-ammonia

AUTHORS: Daniel Juneau, Kai Yi Wu, Nicole Kaps, Jason Yao, Jennifer M Renaud, Rob S B Beanlands, Terrence D Ruddy, Robert A deKemp

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear cardiology : official publication of the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Background: Myocardial flow reserve (MFR) measurement provides incremental diagnostic and prognostic information. The objective of the current study was to investigate the application of a simplified model for the estimation of MFR using only the stress/rest myocardial activity ratio (MAR) in patients undergoing rest-stress cardiac PET MPI.

Methods and results: Rest and dipyridamole stress dynamic PET imaging was performed in consecutive patients using82Rb or13NH3(n = 250 each). Reference standard MFR was quantified using a standard one-tissue compartment model. Stress/rest myocardial activity ratio (MAR) was calculated using the LV-mean activity from 2 to 6 minutes post-injection. Simplified estimates of MFR (MFREST) were then calculated using an inverse power function. For13NH3, there was good correlation between MFR and MFRESTvalues (R = 0.63), with similar results for82Rb (R = 0.73). There was no bias in the MFRESTvalues with either tracer. The overall diagnostic performance of MFRESTfor detection of MFR < 2 was good with ROC area under the curve (AUC) = 83.2 ± 1.2% for13NH3and AUC = 90.4 ± 0.7% for82Rb.

Conclusion: MFR was estimated with good accuracy using82Rb and13NH3with a simplified method that relies only on stress/rest activity ratios. This novel approach does not require dynamic imaging or tracer kinetic modeling. It may be useful for routine quality assurance of PET MFR measurements, or in scanners where full dynamic imaging and tracer kinetic modeling is not feasible for technical or logistical reasons.

TITLE: Dominance of Tau Burden in Cortical Over Subcortical Regions Mediates Glymphatic Activity and Clinical Severity in PSP

AUTHORS: Jung-Lung Hsu, Yi-Chia Wei, Ing-Tsung Hsiao, Kun-Ju Lin, Tzu-Chen Yen, Chin-Song Lu, Han-Cheng Wang, Alexander Leemans, Yi-Hsin Weng, Kuo-Lun Huang

JOURNAL: Clinical nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Background: Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a tauopathy that involves subcortical regions but also extends to cortical areas. The clinical impact of different tau protein sites and their influence on glymphatic dysfunction have not been investigated.

Patients and methods: Participants (n = 55; 65.6 ± 7.1 years; 29 women) with PSP (n = 32) and age-matched normal controls (NCs; n = 23) underwent 18 F-Florzolotau tau PET, MRI, PSP Rating Scale (PSPRS), and Mini-Mental State Examination. Cerebellar gray matter (GM) and parametric estimation of reference signal intensity were used as references for tau burden measured by SUV ratios. Glymphatic activity was measured by diffusion tensor image analysis along the perivascular space (DTI-ALPS).

Results: Parametric estimation of reference signal intensity is a better reference than cerebellar GM to distinguish tau burden between PSP and NCs. PSP patients showed higher cortical and subcortical tau SUV ratios than NCs ( P < 0.001 and <0.001). Cortical and subcortical tau deposition correlated with PSPRS, UPDRS, and Mini-Mental State Examination scores (all P 's < 0.05). Cortical tau deposition was further associated with the DTI-ALPS index and frontal-temporal-parietal GM atrophy. The DTI-ALPS indexes showed a significantly negative correlation with the PSPRS total scores ( P < 0.01). Finally, parietal and occipital lobe tau depositions showed mediating effects between the DTI-ALPS index and PSPRS score.

Conclusions: Cortical tau deposition is associated with glymphatic dysfunction and plays a role in mediating glymphatic dysfunction and clinical severity. Our results provide a possible explanation for the worsening of clinical severity in patients with PSP.

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: To assess the lower [18F]FDG limit in administered activity and/or scan time reduction capabilities of a digital-BGO 32-cm axial field-of-view PET system while being compliant with current and updated EANM Research Ltd Fluorine-18 accreditation specifications (EARL1and EARL2).

Methods: EARL1and EARL2compliance of the digital-BGO system (Omni Legend 32 cm) was tested for several reconstructions, including those that apply precision deep learning-based image enhancement (PDL) as postprocessing, using the calibration QC and NEMA IEC phantom measurements. The image quality QC scan was repeated every hour for 7 h, with each subsequent hour representing a lower administered activity, and reconstructed for various times per bed position, i.e. 30, 60, 120, 180, and 300 s. For each of the image quality QC images, coefficient of variation (COV) of the background compartment, and mean, maximum and peak activity concentration recovery coefficients (RCmean, RCmaxand RCpeak) of differently-sized spheres were calculated and compared to current and updated EARL accreditation specifications.

Results: When we apply 1 min per bed position for PET acquisition, [18F]FDG administration can be reduced by a factor of ∼ 4 for EARL1, by a factor of ∼ 8 for EARL2(2 mm voxels) and by a factor of ∼ 4 for EARL2(4 mm voxels) using both standard reconstructions and PDL post-processing compared to current EANM recommendations for [18F]FDG administration (7 MBqminbed-1kg-1).

Conclusions: Reduction in [18F]FDG administered activity is possible by at least a factor 4 for 1 min/bed with the Omni Legend 32 cm PET/CT while maintaining EARL1and EARL2compliance.

ABSTRACT:
Our aim was to define a lower limit of reduced injected activity in delayed [18F]FDG total-body (TB) PET/CT in pediatric oncology patients.Methods:In this single-center prospective study, children were scanned for 20 min with TB PET/CT, 120 min after intravenous administration of a 4.07 ± 0.49 MBq/kg dose of [18F]FDG. Five randomly subsampled low-count reconstructions were generated using ¼, ⅛, [Formula: see text], and [Formula: see text] of the counts in the full-dose list-mode reference standard acquisition (20 min), to simulate dose reduction. For the 2 lowest-count reconstructions, smoothing was applied. Background uptake was measured with volumes of interest placed on the ascending aorta, right liver lobe, and third lumbar vertebra body (L3). Tumor lesions were segmented using a 40% isocontour volume-of-interest approach. Signal-to-noise ratio, tumor-to-background ratio, and contrast-to-noise ratio were calculated. Three physicians identified malignant lesions independently and assessed the image quality using a 5-point Likert scale.Results:In total, 113 malignant lesions were identified in 18 patients, who met the inclusion criteria. Of these lesions, 87.6% were quantifiable. Liver SUVmeandid not change significantly, whereas a lower signal-to-noise ratio was observed in all low-count reconstructions compared with the reference standard (P< 0.0001) because of higher noise rates. Tumor uptake (SUVmax), tumor-to-background ratio, and total lesion count were significantly lower in the reconstructions with [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] of the counts of the reference standard (P< 0.001). Contrast-to-noise ratio and clinical image quality were significantly lower in all low-count reconstructions than with the reference standard.Conclusion:Dose reduction for delayed [18F]FDG TB PET/CT imaging in children is possible without loss of image quality or lesion conspicuity. However, our results indicate that to maintain comparable tumor uptake and lesion conspicuity, PET centers should not reduce the injected [18F]FDG activity below 0.5 MBq/kg when using TB PET/CT in pediatric imaging at 120 min after injection.

TITLE: Relationship between multi-pool model-based chemical exchange saturation transfer imaging, intravoxel incoherent motion MRI, and 11C-methionine uptake on PET/CT in patients with gliomas

JOURNAL: Magnetic resonance imaging

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Magnetization transfer ratio asymmetry (MTRasym) analysis is used for chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) in patients with gliomas; however, this approach has limitations. CEST imaging using a multi-pool model (MPM) may allow a more detailed assessment of gliomas; however, its mechanism remains unknown. This study aimed to assess the relationship between CEST imaging by MPM, intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM), and11C-methionine (11C-MET) uptake on positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) to clarify the clinical significance of CEST imaging using MPM in gliomas.

Methods: This retrospective study included 17 patients with gliomas who underwent11C-MET PET/CT at our institution between January 2020 and January 2022. Two-dimensional axial CEST imaging was conducted using single-shot fast-spin echo acquisition at 3 T. The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), true diffusion coefficient (D), pseudo-diffusion coefficient (D*), f, MTRasym (3.5 ppm), parameters of MPM-based CEST imaging, and tumor-to-contralateral normal brain tissue (T/N) ratio were calculated using a region-of-interest analysis. Shapiro-Wilk test, weighted kappa coefficient, and Spearman's rank correlation coefficients were used for statistical analysis.

Results: Significant correlations were found between APT_T1 and T/N ratio (ρ = 0.87, p < 0.001), APT_T2 and T/N ratio (ρ = 0.47, p < 0.05), MTRasym and T/N ratio (ρ = 0.55, p < 0.01), and T2/T1 and T/N ratio (ρ = -0.36, p < 0.05). Furthermore, significant correlations were observed between APT_T1 and ADC (ρ = -0.67, p < 0.001), APT_T1 and D (ρ = -0.70, p < 0.001), APT_T2 and D* (ρ = -0.45, p < 0.05), and T2/T1 and D (ρ = 0.39, p < 0.05).

Conclusion: These preliminary findings indicate that MPM-based CEST imaging parameters correlate with IVIM and11C-MET uptake on PET/CT in patients with gliomas. In particular, the new parameter APT_T1 correlated more strongly with11C-MET uptake compared to the traditional CEST parameter MTRasym.

TITLE: Plausibility and redundancy analysis to select FDG-PET textural features in non-small cell lung cancer

AUTHORS: Elisabeth Pfaehler, Liesbet Mesotten, Ivan Zhovannik, Simone Pieplenbosch, Michiel Thomeer, Karolien Vanhove, Peter Adriaensens, Ronald Boellaard

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Background: Radiomics refers to the extraction of a large number of image biomarker describing the tumor phenotype displayed in a medical image. Extracted from positron emission tomography (PET) images, radiomics showed diagnostic and prognostic value for several cancer types. However, a large number of radiomic features are nonreproducible or highly correlated with conventional PET metrics. Moreover, radiomic features used in the clinic should yield relevant information about tumor texture. In this study, we propose a framework to identify technical and clinical meaningful features and exemplify our results using a PET non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) dataset.

Materials and methods: The proposed selection procedure consists of several steps. A priori, we only include features that were found to be reproducible in a multicenter setting. Next, we apply a voxel randomization step to identify features that reflect actual textural information, that is, that yield in 90% of the patient scans a value significantly different from random texture. Finally, the remaining features were correlated with standard PET metrics to further remove redundancy with common PET metrics. The selection procedure was performed for different volume ranges, that is, excluding lesions with smaller volumes in order to assess the effect of tumor size on the results. To exemplify our procedure, the selected features were used to predict 1-yr survival in a dataset of 150 NSCLC patients. A predictive model was built using volume as predictive factor for smaller, and one of the selected features as predictive factor for bigger lesions. The prediction accuracy of the both models were compared with the prediction accuracy of volume.

Results: The number of selected features depended on the lesion size included in the analysis. When including the whole dataset, from 19 features reflecting actual texture only two were found to be not strongly correlated with conventional PET metrics. When excluding lesions smaller than 11.49 and 33.10 mL (25 and 50 percentile of the dataset), four out of 27 features and 13 out of 29 features remained after eliminating features highly correlated with standard PET metrics. When excluding lesions smaller than 103.9 mL (75 percentile), 33 out of 53 features remained. For larger lesions, some of these features outperformed volume in terms of classification accuracy (increase of 4-10%). The combination of using volume as predictor for smaller and one of the selected features for larger lesions also improved the accuracy when compared with volume only (increase from 72% to 76%).

Conclusion: When performing radiomic analysis for smaller lesions, it should be first carefully investigated if a textural feature reflects actual heterogeneity information. Next, verification of the absence of correlation with all conventional PET metrics is essential in order to assess the additional value of radiomic features. Radiomic analysis with lesions larger than 11.4 mL might give additional information to conventional metrics while at the same time reflecting actual tumor texture. Using a combination of volume and one of the selected features for prediction yields promise to increase accuracy and reliability of a radiomic model.

TITLE: Synergistic motion compensation strategies for positron emission tomography when acquired simultaneously with magnetic resonance imaging

AUTHORS: Irene Polycarpou, Georgios Soultanidis, Charalampos Tsoumpas

JOURNAL: Philosophical transactions. Series A, Mathematical, physical, and engineering sciences

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Subject motion in positron emission tomography (PET) is a key factor that degrades image resolution and quality, limiting its potential capabilities. Correcting for it is complicated due to the lack of sufficient measured PET data from each position. This poses a significant barrier in calculating the amount of motion occurring during a scan. Motion correction can be implemented at different stages of data processing either during or after image reconstruction, and once applied accurately can substantially improve image quality and information accuracy. With the development of integrated PET-MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scanners, internal organ motion can be measured concurrently with both PET and MRI. In this review paper, we explore the synergistic use of PET and MRI data to correct for any motion that affects the PET images. Different types of motion that can occur during PET-MRI acquisitions are presented and the associated motion detection, estimation and correction methods are reviewed. Finally, some highlights from recent literature in selected human and animal imaging applications are presented and the importance of motion correction for accurate kinetic modelling in dynamic PET-MRI is emphasized. This article is part of the theme issue 'Synergistic tomographic image reconstruction: part 2'.

ABSTRACT:
Our purpose was to investigate differences between PET/MRI and PET/CT in lesion detection and classification in oncologic whole-body examinations and to investigate radiation exposure differences between the 2 modalities.Methods:In this observational single-center study, 1,003 oncologic examinations (918 patients; mean age, 57.8 ± 14.4 y) were included. Patients underwent PET/CT and subsequent PET/MRI (149.8 ± 49.7 min after tracer administration). Examinations were reviewed by radiologists and nuclear medicine physicians in consensus. Additional findings, characterization of indeterminate findings on PET/CT, and missed findings on PET/MRI, including their clinical relevance and effective dose of both modalities, were investigated. The McNemar test was used to compare lesion detection between the 2 hybrid imaging modalities (P< 0.001, indicating statistical significance).Results:Additional information on PET/MRI was reported for 26.3% (264/1,003) of examinations, compared with PET/CT (P< 0.001). Of these, additional malignant findings were detected in 5.3% (53/1,003), leading to a change in TNM staging in 2.9% (29/1,003) due to PET/MRI. Definite lesion classification of indeterminate PET/CT findings was possible in 11.1% (111/1,003) with PET/MRI. In 2.9% (29/1,003), lesions detected on PET/CT were not visible on PET/MRI. Malignant lesions were missed in 1.2% (12/1,003) on PET/MRI, leading to a change in TNM staging in 0.5% (5/1,003). The estimated mean effective dose for whole-body PET/CT amounted to 17.6 ± 8.7 mSv, in comparison to 3.6 ± 1.4 mSv for PET/MRI, resulting in a potential dose reduction of 79.6% (P< 0.001).Conclusion:PET/MRI facilitates staging comparable to that of PET/CT and improves lesion detectability in selected cancers, potentially helping to promote fast, efficient local and whole-body staging in 1 step, when additional MRI is recommended. Furthermore, younger patients may benefit from the reduced radiation exposure of PET/MRI.

ABSTRACT:
We developed a DICOM dataset that can be used to evaluate the performance of de-identification algorithms. DICOM objects (a total of 1,693 CT, MRI, PET, and digital X-ray images) were selected from datasets published in the Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA). Synthetic Protected Health Information (PHI) was generated and inserted into selected DICOM Attributes to mimic typical clinical imaging exams. The DICOM Standard and TCIA curation audit logs guided the insertion of synthetic PHI into standard and non-standard DICOM data elements. A TCIA curation team tested the utility of the evaluation dataset. With this publication, the evaluation dataset (containing synthetic PHI) and de-identified evaluation dataset (the result of TCIA curation) are released on TCIA in advance of a competition, sponsored by the National Cancer Institute (NCI), for algorithmic de-identification of medical image datasets. The competition will use a much larger evaluation dataset constructed in the same manner. This paper describes the creation of the evaluation datasets and guidelines for their use.

AUTHORS: Yanhui Ding, Kun Zhao, Tongtong Che, Kai Du, Hongzan Sun, Shu Liu, Yuanjie Zheng, Shuyu Li, Bing Liu, Yong Liu, Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative

JOURNAL: Cerebral cortex (New York, N.Y. : 1991)

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Growing evidence indicates that amyloid-beta (Aβ) accumulation is one of the most common neurobiological biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The primary aim of this study was to explore whether the radiomic features of Aβ positron emission tomography (PET) images are used as predictors and provide a neurobiological foundation for AD. The radiomics features of Aβ PET imaging of each brain region of the Brainnetome Atlas were computed for classification and prediction using a support vector machine model. The results showed that the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.93 for distinguishing AD (N = 291) from normal control (NC; N = 334). Additionally, the AUC was 0.83 for the prediction of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) converting (N = 88) (vs. no conversion, N = 100) to AD. In the MCI and AD groups, the systemic analysis demonstrated that the classification outputs were significantly associated with clinical measures (apolipoprotein E genotype, polygenic risk scores, polygenic hazard scores, cerebrospinal fluid Aβ, and Tau, cognitive ability score, the conversion time for progressive MCI subjects and cognitive changes). These findings provide evidence that the radiomic features of Aβ PET images can serve as new biomarkers for clinical applications in AD/MCI, further providing evidence for predicting whether MCI subjects will convert to AD.

ABSTRACT:
PREAMBLEThe Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (SNMMI) is an international scientific and professional organization founded in 1954 to promote the science, technology, and practical application of nuclear medicine. The European Association of Nuclear Medicine (EANM) is a professional nonprofit medical association founded in 1985 to facilitate communication worldwide among individuals pursuing clinical and academic excellence in nuclear medicine. SNMMI and EANM members are physicians, technologists, and scientists specializing in the research and practice of nuclear medicine.The SNMMI and EANM will periodically put forth new standards/guidelines for nuclear medicine practice to help advance the science of nuclear medicine and improve service to patients. Existing standards/guidelines will be reviewed for revision or renewal, as appropriate, on their fifth anniversary or sooner, if indicated. Each standard/guideline, representing a policy statement by the SNMMI/EANM, has undergone a thorough consensus process, entailing extensive review. The SNMMI and EANM recognize that the safe and effective use of diagnostic nuclear medicine imaging requires particular training and skills, as described in each document. These standards/guidelines are educational tools designed to assist practitioners in providing appropriate and effective nuclear medicine care for patients. These guidelines are consensus documents, and are not inflexible rules or requirements of practice. They are not intended, nor should they be used, to establish a legal standard of care. For these reasons and those set forth below, the SNMMI and the EANM cautions against the use of these standards/guidelines in litigation in which the clinical decisions of a practitioner are called into question.The ultimate judgment regarding the propriety of any specific procedure or course of action must be made by medical professionals taking into account the unique circumstances of each case. Thus, there is no implication that action differing from what is laid out in the standards/guidelines, standing alone, is below standard of care. To the contrary, a conscientious practitioner may responsibly adopt a course of action different from that set forth in the standards/guidelines when, in the reasonable judgment of the practitioner, such course of action is indicated by the condition of the patient, limitations of available resources, or advances in knowledge or technology subsequent to publication of the standards/guidelines.The practice of medicine involves not only the science, but also the art of dealing with the prevention, diagnosis, alleviation, and treatment of disease. The variety and complexity of human conditions make it impossible for general guidelines to consistently allow for an accurate diagnosis to be reached or a particular treatment response to be predicted. Therefore, it should be recognized that adherence to these standards/guidelines will not ensure a successful outcome. All that should be expected is that the practitioner follows a reasonable course of action, based on their level of training, the current knowledge, the available resources, and the needs/context of the particular patient being treated.PET and computerized tomography (CT) have been widely used in oncology.18F-FDG is the most common radiotracer used for PET imaging. The purpose of this document is to provide imaging specialists and clinicians guidelines for recommending, performing, and interpreting18F-FDG PET/CT in pediatric patients in oncology. There is not a high level of evidence for all recommendations suggested in this paper. These recommendations represent the expert opinions of experienced leaders in this field. Further studies are needed to have evidence-based recommendations for the application of18F-FDG PET/CT in pediatric oncology. These recommendations should be viewed in the context of good practice of nuclear medicine and are not intended to be a substitute for national and international legal or regulatory provisions.

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Predicting recurrence following stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for non-small cell lung cancer provides important information for the feasibility of the individualized radiotherapy and allows to select the appropriate treatment strategy based on the risk of recurrence. In this study, we evaluated the performance of both machine learning models using positron emission tomography (PET) and computed tomography (CT) radiomic features for predicting recurrence after SBRT.

Methods: Planning CT and PET images of 82 non-small cell lung cancer patients who performed SBRT at our hospital were used. First, tumors were delineated on each CT and PET of each patient, and 111 unique radiomic features were extracted, respectively. Next, the 10 features were selected using three different feature selection algorithms, respectively. Recurrence prediction models based on the selected features and four different machine learning algorithms were developed, respectively. Finally, we compared the predictive performance of each model for each recurrence pattern using the mean area under the curve (AUC) calculated following the 0.632+ bootstrap method.

Results: The highest performance for local recurrence, regional lymph node metastasis, and distant metastasis were observed in models using Support vector machine with PET features (mean AUC = 0.646), Naive Bayes with PET features (mean AUC = 0.611), and Support vector machine with CT features (mean AUC = 0.645), respectively.

Conclusions: We comprehensively evaluated the performance of prediction model developed for recurrence following SBRT. The model in this study would provide information to predict the recurrence pattern and assist in making treatment strategies.

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging has been widely used in clinical practice. Long axial field-of-view (LAFOV) systems have enhanced clinical practice by leveraging their technological advantages and have emerged as the new state-of-the-art PET imaging modalities. A consensus was conducted to explore expert views in this emerging field to comprehensively elucidate the proposed workflow in LAFOV PET/CT examinations and highlight the potential challenges inherent in the workflow.

Methods: A multidisciplinary task group formed by 28 experts from six countries over the world discussed and approved the consensus based on the published guidelines, peer-reviewed articles of LAFOV PET/CT, and the collective experience from clinical practice. This consensus focuses on the workflow that allows for a broader range of imaging protocols of LAFOV PET/CT, catering to diverse patient needs and in line with precision medicine principles.

Results: This consensus describes the workflows and imaging protocols of LAFOV PET/CT for various imaging scenarios including routine static imaging, dynamic imaging, low-activity imaging, fast imaging, prolonged imaging, delayed imaging, and dual-tracer imaging. In addition, imaging reconstruction and reviewing specific to LAFOV PET/CT imaging, as well as the main challenges facing installation and application of LAFOV PET/CT scanner were also summarized.

Conclusion: This consensus summarized the various imaging workflow, imaging protocol, and challenges of LAFOV PET/CT imaging, aiming to enhance the clinical and research applications of these scanners.

TITLE: Simulation of Low-Dose Protocols for Myocardial Perfusion 82Rb Imaging

AUTHORS: Martin Lyngby Lassen, Yuka Otaki, Paul Kavanagh, Robert J H Miller, Daniel S Berman, Piotr J Slomka

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Quantification of myocardial perfusion and myocardial blood flow using82Rb PET is increasingly used for assessment of coronary artery disease. Current guidelines suggest injections of 1,100-1,500 MBq for both stress and rest. Reducing the injected dose avoids PET system saturation in first-pass flow images and reduces radiation exposure, but the impact on myocardial perfusion quantification of static perfusion images is not fully understood. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the feasibility of performing myocardial perfusion scans using either a half-dose (HfD) or quarter-dose (QD) protocol using reconstructions from acquired full-dose (FD) scans.Methods:This study comprised 171 patients who underwent rest/stress82Rb PET with a 3-dimensional 4-ring PET/CT scanner using a FD protocol and invasive coronary angiography within 6 mo of the PET emission scan. HfD and QD reconstructions were obtained using the prescribed percentage of events from the FD list-mode files. The total perfusion deficit was quantified for rest (rTPD), stress (sTPD), and ischemia (ITPD = sTPD - rTPD). Diagnostic accuracy for obstructive coronary artery disease, defined as at least 70% stenosis in any of the 3 major coronary arteries, was compared with area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC).Results:Patients with a median body mass index of 28.0 (interquartile range, 23.9-31.7) were injected with doses of 1,165 ± 189 MBq of82Rb. For sTPD, FD and HfD protocols had similar AUCs (FD, 0.807; HfD, 0.802;P= 0.108), whereas QD had a reduced AUC (0.786,P= 0.037). There was no difference in the AUC obtained for ITPD among the 3 protocols (FD, 0.831; HfD, 0.835; QD, 0.831; allP≥ 0.805).Conclusion:HfD imaging does not affect the quantitative diagnostic accuracy of82Rb PET on 3-dimensional PET/CT systems and could be used clinically.

TITLE: Measurement of PET Quantitative Bias In Vivo

AUTHORS: Martin A Lodge, Wojciech Lesniak, Michael A Gorin, Kenneth J Pienta, Steven P Rowe, Martin G Pomper

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Quantitative imaging biomarkers are widely used in PET for both research and clinical applications, yet bias in the underlying image data has not been well characterized. In the absence of a readily available reference standard for in vivo quantification, bias in PET images has been inferred using physical phantoms, even though arrangements of this sort provide only a poor approximation of the imaging environment in real patient examinations. In this study, we used data acquired from patient volunteers to assess PET quantitative bias in vivo. Image-derived radioactivity concentrations in the descending aorta were compared with blood samples counted on a calibrated γ-counter.Methods:Ten patients with prostate cancer were studied using 2-(3-(1-carboxy-5-[(6-18F-fluoro-pyridine-3-carbonyl)-amino]-pentyl)-ureido)-pentanedioic acid PET/CT. For each patient, 3 whole-body PET/CT image series were acquired after a single administration of the radiotracer: shortly after injection as well as approximately 1 and 4 h later. Venous blood samples were obtained at 8 time points over an 8-h period, and whole blood was counted on a NaI γ-counter. A 10-mm-diameter, 20-mm-long cylindric volume of interest was positioned in the descending thoracic aorta to estimate the PET-derived radioactivity concentration in blood. A triexponential function was fit to the γ-counter blood data and used to estimate the radioactivity concentration at the time of each PET acquisition.Results:The PET-derived and γ-counter-derived radioactivity concentrations were linearly related, with anR2of 0.985, over a range of relevant radioactivity concentrations. The mean difference between the PET and γ-counter data was 4.8% ± 8.6%, with the PET measurements tending to be greater.Conclusion:Human image data acquired on a conventional whole-body PET/CT system with a typical clinical protocol differed by an average of around 5% from blood samples counted on a calibrated γ-counter. This bias may be partly attributable to residual uncorrected scatter or attenuation correction error. These data offer an opportunity for the assessment of PET bias in vivo and provide additional support for the use of quantitative imaging biomarkers.

AUTHORS: Claudia Ortega, Reut Anconina, Sayali Joshi, Ur Metser, Anca Prica, Sarah Johnson, Zhihui Amy Liu, Sareh Keshavarzi, Patrick Veit-Haibach

JOURNAL: Nuclear medicine communications

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: The purposes was to build model incorporating PET + computed tomography (CT) radiomics features from baseline PET/CT + clinical parameters to predict outcomes in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphomas.

Methods: Cohort of 138 patients with complete clinical parameters and follow up times of 25.3 months recorded. Textural analysis of PET and manual correlating contouring in CT images analyzed using LIFE X software. Defined outcomes were overall survival (OS), disease free-survival, radiotherapy, and unfavorable response (defined as disease progression) assessed by end of therapy PET/CT or contrast CT. Univariable and multivariable analysis performed to assess association between PET, CT, and clinical.

Results: Male ( P = 0.030), abnormal lymphocytes ( P = 0.030), lower value of PET entropy ( P = 0.030), higher value of SHAPE sphericity ( P = 0.002) were significantly associated with worse OS. Advanced stage (III or IV, P = 0.013), abnormal lymphocytes ( P = 0.032), higher value of CT gray-level run length matrix (GLRLM) LRLGE mean ( P = 0.010), higher value of PET gray-level co-occurrence matrix energy angular second moment ( P < 0.001), and neighborhood gray-level different matrix (NGLDM) busyness mean ( P < 0.001) were significant predictors of shorter DFS. Abnormal lymphocyte ( P = 0.033), lower value of CT NGLDM coarseness ( P = 0.082), and higher value of PET GLRLM gray-level nonuniformity zone mean ( P = 0.040) were significant predictors of unfavorable response to chemotherapy. Area under the curve for the three models (clinical alone, clinical + PET parameters, and clinical + PET + CT parameters) were 0.626, 0.716, and 0.759, respectively.

TITLE: Volumetric and textural analysis of PET/CT in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma highlights the importance of novel MTVrate feature

AUTHORS: Sándor Czibor, Zselyke Csatlós, Krisztián Fábián, Márton Piroska, Tamás Györke

JOURNAL: Nuclear medicine communications

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Objectives: To investigate the prognostic value of clinical, volumetric, and radiomics-based textural parameters in baseline [ 18 F]FDG-PET/CT scans of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients.

Methods: We retrospectively investigated baseline PET/CT scans and collected clinical data of fifty DLBCL patients. PET images were segmented semiautomatically to determine metabolic tumor volume (MTV), then the largest segmented lymphoma volume of interest (VOI) was used to extract first-, second-, and high-order textural features. A novel value, MTVrate was introduced as the quotient of the largest lesion's volume and total body MTV. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analyses were performed and 24-months progression-free survival (PFS) of low- and high-risk cohorts were compared by log-rank analyses. A machine learning algorithm was used to build a prognostic model from the available clinical, volumetric, and textural data based on logistic regression.

Results: The area-under-the-curve (AUC) on ROC analysis was the highest of MTVrate at 0.74, followed by lactate-dehydrogenase, MTV, and skewness, with AUCs of 0.68, 0.63, and 0.55, respectively which parameters were also able to differentiate the PFS. A combined survival analysis including MTV and MTVrate identified a subgroup with particularly low PFS at 38%. In the machine learning-based model had an AUC of 0.83 and the highest relative importance was attributed to three textural features and both MTV and MTVrate as important predictors of PFS.

Conclusion: Individual evaluation of different biomarkers yielded only limited prognostic data, whereas a machine learning-based combined analysis had higher effectivity. MTVrate had the highest prognostic ability on individual analysis and, combined with MTV, it identified a patient group with particularly poor prognosis.

TITLE: Quantification of uptake in pelvis F-18 FLT PET-CT images using a 3D localization and segmentation CNN

AUTHORS: Xiaofan Xiong, Brian J Smith, Stephen A Graves, John J Sunderland, Michael M Graham, Brandie A Gross, John M Buatti, Reinhard R Beichel

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: The purpose of this work was to develop and validate a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) approach for the automated pelvis segmentation in computed tomography (CT) scans to enable the quantification of active pelvic bone marrow by means of Fluorothymidine F-18 (FLT) tracer uptake measurement in positron emission tomography (PET) scans. This quantification is a critical step in calculating bone marrow dose for radiopharmaceutical therapy clinical applications as well as external beam radiation doses.

Methods: An approach for the combined localization and segmentation of the pelvis in CT volumes of varying sizes, ranging from full-body to pelvis CT scans, was developed that utilizes a novel CNN architecture in combination with a random sampling strategy. The method was validated on 34 planning CT scans and 106 full-body FLT PET-CT scans using a cross-validation strategy. Specifically, two different training and CNN application options were studied, quantitatively assessed, and statistically compared.

Results: The proposed method was able to successfully locate and segment the pelvis in all test cases. On all data sets, an average Dice coefficient of 0.93960.0182 or better was achieved. The relative tracer uptake measurement error ranged between 0.065% and 0.204%. The proposed approach is time-efficient and shows a reduction in runtime of up to 95% compared to a standard U-Net-based approach without a localization component.

Conclusions: The proposed method enables the efficient calculation of FLT uptake in the pelvis. Thus, it represents a valuable tool to facilitate bone marrow preserving adaptive radiation therapy and radiopharmaceutical dose calculation. Furthermore, the method can be adapted to process other bone structures as well as organs.

TITLE: Tracer-Separator: A Deep Learning Model for Brain PET Dual-Tracer ( 18 F-FDG and Amyloid) Separation

AUTHORS: Amirhossein Sanaat, Yiyi Hu, Cecilia Boccalini, Yazdan Salimi, Zahra Mansouri, Eliluane Pirazzo Andrade Teixeira, Gregory Mathoux, Valentina Garibotto, Habib Zaidi

JOURNAL: Clinical nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Introduction: Multiplexed PET imaging revolutionized clinical decision-making by simultaneously capturing various radiotracer data in a single scan, enhancing diagnostic accuracy and patient comfort. Through a transformer-based deep learning, this study underscores the potential of advanced imaging techniques to streamline diagnosis and improve patient outcomes.

Patients and methods: The research cohort consisted of 120 patients spanning from cognitively unimpaired individuals to those with mild cognitive impairment, dementia, and other mental disorders. Patients underwent various imaging assessments, including 3D T1-weighted MRI, amyloid PET scans using either 18 F-florbetapir (FBP) or 18 F-flutemetamol (FMM), and 18 F-FDG PET. Summed images of FMM/FBP and FDG were used as proxy for simultaneous scanning of 2 different tracers. A SwinUNETR model, a convolution-free transformer architecture, was trained for image translation. The model was trained using mean square error loss function and 5-fold cross-validation. Visual evaluation involved assessing image similarity and amyloid status, comparing synthesized images with actual ones. Statistical analysis was conducted to determine the significance of differences.

Results: Visual inspection of synthesized images revealed remarkable similarity to reference images across various clinical statuses. The mean centiloid bias for dementia, mild cognitive impairment, and healthy control subjects and for FBP tracers is 15.70 ± 29.78, 0.35 ± 33.68, and 6.52 ± 25.19, respectively, whereas for FMM, it is -6.85 ± 25.02, 4.23 ± 23.78, and 5.71 ± 21.72, respectively. Clinical evaluation by 2 readers further confirmed the model's efficiency, with 97 FBP/FMM and 63 FDG synthesized images (from 120 subjects) found similar to ground truth diagnoses (rank 3), whereas 3 FBP/FMM and 15 FDG synthesized images were considered nonsimilar (rank 1). Promising sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were achieved in amyloid status assessment based on synthesized images, with an average sensitivity of 95 ± 2.5, specificity of 72.5 ± 12.5, and accuracy of 87.5 ± 2.5. Error distribution analyses provided valuable insights into error levels across brain regions, with most falling between -0.1 and +0.2 SUV ratio. Correlation analyses demonstrated strong associations between actual and synthesized images, particularly for FMM images (FBP: Y = 0.72X + 20.95, R2 = 0.54; FMM: Y = 0.65X + 22.77, R2 = 0.77).

Conclusions: This study demonstrated the potential of a novel convolution-free transformer architecture, SwinUNETR, for synthesizing realistic FDG and FBP/FMM images from summation scans mimicking simultaneous dual-tracer imaging.

TITLE: GWO+RuleFit: rule-based explainable machine-learning combined with heuristics to predict mid-treatment FDG PET response to chemoradiation for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer

AUTHORS: Chunyan Duan, Qiantuo Liu, Jiajie Wang, Qianqian Tong, Fangyun Bai, Jie Han, Shouyi Wang, Daniel S Hippe, Jing Zeng, Stephen R Bowen

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Objective.Vital rules learned from fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) radiomics of tumor subregional response can provide clinical decision support for precise treatment adaptation. We combined a rule-based machine learning (ML) model (RuleFit) with a heuristic algorithm (gray wolf optimizer, GWO) for mid-chemoradiation FDG-PET response prediction in patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer.Approach.Tumors subregions were identified using K-means clustering. GWO+RuleFit consists of three main parts: (i) a random forest is constructed based on conventional features or radiomic features extracted from tumor regions or subregions in FDG-PET images, from which the initial rules are generated; (ii) GWO is used for iterative rule selection; (iii) the selected rules are fit to a linear model to make predictions about the target variable. Two target variables were considered: a binary response measure (ΔSUVmean ⩾ 20% decline) for classification and a continuous response measure (ΔSUVmean) for regression. GWO+RuleFit was benchmarked against common ML algorithms and RuleFit, with leave-one-out cross-validated performance evaluated by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) in classification and root-mean-square error (RMSE) in regression.Main results.GWO+RuleFit selected 15 rules from the radiomic feature dataset of 23 patients. For treatment response classification, GWO+RuleFit attained numerically better cross-validated performance than RuleFit across tumor regions and sets of features (AUC: 0.58-0.86 vs. 0.52-0.78,p= 0.170-0.925). GWO+Rulefit also had the best or second-best performance numerically compared to all other algorithms for all conditions. For treatment response regression prediction, GWO+RuleFit (RMSE: 0.162-0.192) performed better numerically for low-dimensional models (p= 0.097-0.614) and significantly better for high-dimensional models across all tumor regions except one (RMSE: 0.189-0.219,p< 0.004).Significance. The GWO+RuleFit selected rules were interpretable, highlighting distinct radiomic phenotypes that modulated treatment response. GWO+Rulefit achieved parsimonious models while maintaining utility for treatment response prediction, which can aid clinical decisions for patient risk stratification, treatment selection, and biologically driven adaptation. Clinical trial:NCT02773238.

TITLE: Nomograms based on SUVmax of 18F-FDG PET/CT and clinical parameters for predicting progression-free and overall survival in patients with newly diagnosed extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma

AUTHORS: Hongyan Li, Guozhu Shao, Yajing Zhang, Xiaomin Chen, Chengcheng Du, Kun Wang, Zairong Gao

JOURNAL: Cancer imaging : the official publication of the International Cancer Imaging Society

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Background: The prognostic value of18F-FDG PET/CT in extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma (ENKTL) is not well established. We aimed to develop nomograms for individualized estimates of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with ENKTL using18F-FDG PET/CT parameters and clinical parameters.

Methods: A total of 171 patients with newly diagnosed ENKTL undergoing18F-FDG PET/CT scanning were retrospectively analyzed. Nomograms were constructed according to multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression. The predictive and discriminatory capacities of the nomograms were then measured using the concordance index (C-index), calibration plots, and Kaplan-Meier curves. The C-index, the area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC), and decision curve analysis (DCA) were used to contrast the predictive and discriminatory capacities of the nomograms against with the International Prognostic Index (IPI) and Korean Prognostic Index (KPI).

Results: Multivariate analysis demonstrated that pretreatment SUVmax≥9.5, disease stage II and III-IV, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and elevated β2-microglobulin (β2-MG) had the strongest association with unfavorable PFS and OS. In addition, hemoglobin (Hb) < 120 g/L had a tendency to be associated with PFS. Both nomogram models incorporated SUVmax, Ann Arbor stage, LDH, and β2-MG. The PFS nomogram also included Hb. The nomograms showed good prediction accuracies, with the C-indexes for PFS and OS were 0.729 and 0.736, respectively. The calibration plots for 3-year and 5-year PFS/OS reported good consistency between predicted and observed probabilities for survival time. The PFS and OS were significantly different according to tertiles of nomogram scores (p < 0.001). The C-index and AUCs of the nomograms were higher than that of IPI and KPI. Moreover, DCA showed that the predictive accuracy of the nomograms for PFS and OS were both higher than that of IPI and KPI.

Conclusions: This study established nomograms that incorporate pretreatment SUVmax and clinical parameters, which could be effective tools for individualized prognostication of both PFS and OS in patients with newly diagnosed ENKTL.

TITLE: Dynamic 18F-fluorocholine PET/CT for parathyroid imaging in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism

AUTHORS: Wouter A M Broos, Maurits Wondergem, Friso M van der Zant, Nicolaas C Schaper, Remco J J Knol

JOURNAL: Nuclear medicine communications

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Objective: In the past few years, F-fluorocholine PET/CT has been established as a promising imaging technique for preoperative localization of parathyroid adenomas, but the optimal time point to start PET/CT acquisition after tracer injection is yet unknown. The aim of the present study was to assess the optimal time frame to acquire the PET/CT images and to evaluate the ability of dynamic imaging to differentiate parathyroid adenomas from active lymph nodes, a common cause for false-positive scan results.

Patients and methods: Patients with primary hyperparathyroidism who had undergone a dynamic F-fluorocholine PET/CT positive for parathyroid disease and who subsequently underwent successful parathyroidectomy were retrospectively included in this study. On the 20 minutes dynamic images, standardized uptake value measurements were acquired per 1 minute frame for the parathyroid adenoma, the thyroid gland, blood pool activity, and, if present, lymph node activity.

Results: A total of 101 patients were included in this study. Time-activity curves showed a decrease of activity in parathyroid and thyroid glands, with faster wash-out from the thyroid gland and on average a stable, lower activity in lymph nodes. Blood pool activity was particularly present in the first 2 minutes. Differentiation of a parathyroid adenoma from active lymph nodes was best before 5 minutes, but no definitive cutoff value could be determined. Differentiation of a parathyroid adenoma from the thyroid gland was best after 10 minutes.

Conclusion: Dynamic imaging starting at the early time point of 2 minutes after injection of F-fluorocholine is useful for characterization of hyperfunctioning parathyroid glands.

JOURNAL: Bundesgesundheitsblatt, Gesundheitsforschung, Gesundheitsschutz

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
The processing of medical images plays a central role in modern diagnostics and therapy. Automated processing and analysis of medical images can efficiently accelerate clinical workflows and open new opportunities for improved patient care. However, the high variability, complexity, and varying quality of medical image data pose significant challenges. In recent years, the greatest progress in medical image analysis has been achieved through artificial intelligence (AI), particularly by using deep neural networks in the context of deep learning. These methods are successfully applied in medical image analysis, including segmentation, registration, and image synthesis.AI-based segmentation allows for the precise delineation of organs, tissues, or pathological changes. The application of AI-based image registration supports the accelerated creation of 3D planning models for complex surgeries by aligning relevant anatomical structures from different imaging modalities (e.g., CT, MRI, and PET) or time points. Generative AI methods can be used to generate additional image data for the improved training of AI models, thereby expanding the potential applications of deep learning methods in medicine. Examples from radiology, ophthalmology, dermatology, and surgery are described to illustrate their practical relevance and the potential of AI in image-based diagnostics and therapy.

ABSTRACT:
Zielsetzung: Ziel dieser Studie war die Evaluierung des prädiktiven Potenzials der Radiomics-Analyse zur Bestimmung des N- und M-Stadiums des primären Zervixkarzinoms anhand multiparametrischer18F-FDG-PET/MRT-Bildgebung.

Material und methoden: 30 Patientinnen mit einem histologisch gesicherten, primären und therapienaiven Zervixkarzinom unterzogen sich einer multiparametrischen18F-FDG-PET/MRT-Untersuchung unter Verwendung eines dedizierten Untersuchungsprotokolls des weiblichen Beckens. Nach Segmentierung der Primärtumoren wurden quantitative Bildparameter mittels der Radiomic-Image-Processing-Toolbox bestimmt. Insgesamt wurden 45 verschiedene quantitative Bildmerkmale jeweils anhand der T2-gewichteten TSE-Sequenzen, der nativen und kontrastmittelgestützten T1-gewichteten TSE-Sequenzen, der ADC-Map, verschiedenen Perfusionsparametern (Ktrans, Kep, Ve and iAUC) und den18F-FDG-PET-Datensätzen für jeden Tumor extrahiert. Die statistische Analyse zur Bestimmung des N- und M-Stadiums erfolgte unter der Verwendung der Python 3.5 und Scikit-learn-Software-Bibliothek für maschinelles Lernen.

Ergebnisse: Insgesamt zeigte sich eine höhere Genauigkeit zur Prädiktion des korrekten M-Stadiums im Vergleich zum N-Stadium. Zur Prädiktion des korrekten M-Stadiums zeigten sich unter der Verwendung von SVM und SVM-RFE zur Feature-Auswahl die besten Ergebnisse mit einer Sensitivität von 91 %, einer Spezifität von 92 % und einer Fläche unter der Kurve (AUC) von 0,97. Die höchste Genauigkeit für die Bestimmung des N-Stadiums erfolgte unter der Verwendung von RBF-SVM und MIFS zur Feature-Auswahl mit einer Sensitivität von 83 %, einer Spezifität von 67 % und einer Fläche unter der Kurve (AUC) von 0,82.

Schlussfolgerung: Die Radiomics-Analyse von multiparametrischen PET/MR-Datensätzen ermöglicht eine präzise Prädiktion des M- und N-Stadiums von Patientinnen mit primärem Zervixkarzinom und könnte damit supportiv zur nichtinvasiven Tumor-Phänotypisierung und Patientenstratifizierung eingesetzt werden.

Kernaussagen: · Die Radiomics-Analyse der multiparametrischen PET/MRT ermöglicht die Prädiktion des Metastasierungsstatus des Zervixkarzinoms.. · Die Prädiktion des M-Stadiums ist der Prädiktion des N-Stadiums überlegen.. · Die multiparametrische PET/MRT bietet eine valide Plattform für Radiomics-Analysen..

TITLE: Validation of diffuse correlation spectroscopy against 15O-water PET for regional cerebral blood flow measurement in neonatal piglets

ABSTRACT:
Diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) can non-invasively and continuously asses regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) at the cot-side by measuring a blood flow index (BFI) in non-traditional units of cm2/s. We have validated DCS against positron emission tomography using15O-labeled water (15O-water PET) in a piglet model allowing us to derive a conversion formula for BFI to rCBF in conventional units (ml/100g/min). Neonatal piglets were continuously monitored by the BabyLux device integrating DCS and time resolved near infrared spectroscopy (TRS) while acquiring15O-water PET scans at baseline, after injection of acetazolamide and during induced hypoxic episodes. BFI by DCS was highly correlated with rCBF (R = 0.94,p< 0.001) by PET. A scaling factor of 0.89 (limits of agreement for individual measurement: 0.56, 1.39)×109× (ml/100g/min)/(cm2/s) was used to derive baseline rCBF from baseline BFI measurements of another group of piglets and of healthy newborn infants showing an agreement with expected values. These results pave the way towards non-invasive, cot-side absolute CBF measurements by DCS on neonates.

TITLE: 13N-ammonia positron emission tomography-derived left-ventricular strain in patients after heart transplantation validated using cardiovascular magnetic resonance feature tracking as reference

JOURNAL: Annals of nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Objective: Heart transplant rejection leads to cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV).13N-ammonia positron emission tomography (PET) can be useful in detecting CAV, as it can evaluate both epicardial vessels and microvasculature. In this study, we evaluated the regional wall motion in heart transplant patients using our PET-specific feature-tracking (FT) algorithm for myocardial strain calculation and validated it using a cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) FT strain as a reference.

Methods: A total of 15 heart transplant patients who underwent both13N-ammonia PET and CMR within 3 months were retrospectively enrolled. The same slice position of short-axis cine images of the middle slice of left ventricle (LV) and the same slice position of horizontal long-axis cine images were selected for the two modalities to measure the circumferential strain (CS) and longitudinal strain (LS), respectively. Based on the FT technique, time-strain curves were calculated by semi-automatic tracking of the endocardial contour on cine images throughout a cardiac cycle. The peak value in the time-strain curve was defined as the representative value. Correlations of CS and LS between PET and CMR were analyzed using Pearson correlation coefficients. The inter-modality error of strain measurements was evaluated using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) with two-way random single measures.

Results: Excellent correlations of CS and LS between PET and CMR were observed (CS: r = 0.80; p < 0.01; LS: r = 0.87; p < 0.01). Excellent ICCs were observed (0.89 and 0.85) in CS and LS derived from PET.

Conclusions: We propose the first PET strain showing an excellent agreement with the CMR strain and high reproducibility in measurement.

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: [18F]PI-2620 positron emission tomography (PET) detects misfolded tau in progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). We questioned the feasibility and value of absolute [18F]PI-2620 PET quantification for assessing tau by regional distribution volumes (VT). Here, arterial input functions (AIF) represent the gold standard, but cannot be applied in routine clinical practice, whereas image-derived input functions (IDIF) represent a non-invasive alternative. We aimed to validate IDIF against AIF and we evaluated the potential to discriminate patients with PSP and AD from healthy controls by non-invasive quantification of [18F] PET.

Methods: In the first part of the study, we validated AIF derived from radial artery whole blood against IDIF by investigating 20 subjects (ten controls and ten patients). IDIF were generated by manual extraction of the carotid artery using the average and the five highest (max5) voxel intensity values and by automated extraction of the carotid artery using the average and the maximum voxel intensity value. In the second part of the study, IDIF quantification using the IDIF with the closest match to the AIF was transferred to group comparison of a large independent cohort of 40 subjects (15 healthy controls, 15 PSP patients and 10 AD patients). We compared VTand VTratios, both calculated by Logan plots, with distribution volume (DV) ratios using simplified reference tissue modelling and standardized uptake value (SUV) ratios.

Results: AIF and IDIF showed highly correlated input curves for all applied IDIF extraction methods (0.78 < r < 0.83, all p < 0.0001; area under the curves (AUC): 0.73 < r ≤ 0.82, all p ≤ 0.0003). Regarding the VTvalues, correlations were mainly found between those generated by the AIF and by the IDIF methods using the maximum voxel intensity values. Lowest relative differences (RD) were observed by applying the manual method using the five highest voxel intensity values (max5) (AIF vs. IDIF manual, avg: RD = -82%; AIF vs. IDIF automated, avg: RD = -86%; AIF vs. IDIF manual, max5: RD = -6%; AIF vs. IDIF automated, max: RD = -26%). Regional VTvalues revealed considerable variance at group level, which was strongly reduced upon scaling by the inferior cerebellum. The resulting VTratio values were adequate to detect group differences between patients with PSP or AD and healthy controls (HC) (PSP target region (globus pallidus): HC vs. PSP vs. AD: 1.18 vs. 1.32 vs. 1.16; AD target region (Braak region I): HC vs. PSP vs. AD: 1.00 vs. 1.00 vs. 1.22). VTratios and DV ratios outperformed SUV ratios and VTin detecting differences between PSP and healthy controls, whereas all quantification approaches performed similarly in comparing AD and healthy controls.

Conclusion: Blood-free IDIF is a promising approach for quantification of [18F]PI-2620 PET, serving as correlating surrogate for invasive continuous arterial blood sampling. Regional [18F]PI-2620 VTshow large variance, in contrast to regional [18F]PI-2620 VTratios scaled with the inferior cerebellum, which are appropriate for discriminating PSP, AD and healthy controls. DV ratios obtained by simplified reference tissue modeling are similarly suitable for this purpose.

ABSTRACT:
Cerebral β-amyloid deposits and regional glucose metabolism assessed by PET are used to distinguish between Alzheimer disease (AD) and other dementia syndromes. In the present multicenter study, we estimated the prevalence of β-amyloid deposits on PET imaging in a wide variety of dementia syndromes and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) within a memory clinic population.Methods:Of the 1,193 consecutive patients with cognitive impairment (CI) who received 111C-PIB PET or18F-AV45 PET or both11C-PIB PET and18F-AV45 PET, 960 were diagnosed with AD, 36 with frontotemporal dementia (FTD), 5 with dementia with Lewy bodies, 144 with MCI, 29 with vascular dementia, 4 with corticobasal syndrome, and 15 with unclassifiable dementia. Baseline clinical diagnoses were independently established without access to PET imaging results. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype analysis was performed on CI patients and 231 sex- and age-matched controls.Results:Of the 1,193 CI patients, 860 (72.1%) were amyloid-positive. The prevalence of amyloid positivity in AD and MCI patients was 86.8% (833/960) and 9.7% (14/144), respectively. In FTD patients, the prevalence of β-amyloid deposits was 5.6% (2/36). In the 4 corticobasal syndrome patients, 2 were amyloid-positive. Three of the 5 patients with dementia with Lewy bodies showed amyloid positivity, as did 6 of the 29 vascular dementia (20.7%) patients. The ApoEε4 allele frequency was significantly increased in amyloid-positive CI patients (30.5%) as compared with other amyloid-negative CI patients (14%) or controls (7.3%).Conclusion:Amyloid imaging may potentially be the most helpful parameter for differential diagnosis in dementia, particularly to distinguish between AD and FTD. Amyloid PET can be used in conjunction with the ApoEε4 allele genetic risk test for amyloid deposits.

ABSTRACT:
The aim of this study was to validate a previously developed deep learning model in 5 independent clinical trials. The predictive performance of this model was compared with the international prognostic index (IPI) and 2 models incorporating radiomic PET/CT features (clinical PET and PET models).Methods:In total, 1,132 diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients were included: 296 for training and 836 for external validation. The primary outcome was 2-y time to progression. The deep learning model was trained on maximum-intensity projections from PET/CT scans. The clinical PET model included metabolic tumor volume, maximum distance from the bulkiest lesion to another lesion, SUVpeak, age, and performance status. The PET model included metabolic tumor volume, maximum distance from the bulkiest lesion to another lesion, and SUVpeakModel performance was assessed using the area under the curve (AUC) and Kaplan-Meier curves.Results:The IPI yielded an AUC of 0.60 on all external data. The deep learning model yielded a significantly higher AUC of 0.66 (P< 0.01). For each individual clinical trial, the model was consistently better than IPI. Radiomic model AUCs remained higher for all clinical trials. The deep learning and clinical PET models showed equivalent performance (AUC, 0.69;P> 0.05). The PET model yielded the highest AUC of all models (AUC, 0.71;P< 0.05).Conclusion:The deep learning model predicted outcome in all trials with a higher performance than IPI and better survival curve separation. This model can predict treatment outcome in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma without tumor delineation but at the cost of a lower prognostic performance than with radiomics.

TITLE: Digital PET/CT allows for shorter acquisition protocols or reduced radiopharmaceutical dose in [18F]-FDG PET/CT

AUTHORS: Ian Alberts, Christos Sachpekidis, George Prenosil, Marco Viscione, Karl Peter Bohn, Clemens Mingels, Kuangyu Shi, Ali Ashar-Oromieh, Axel Rominger

JOURNAL: Annals of nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: To establish the feasibility of shorter acquisition times (and by analogy, applied activity) on tumour detection and lesion contrast in digital PET/CT.

Methods: Twenty-one randomly selected patients who underwent oncological [18F]-FDG PET/CT on a digital PET/CT were retrospectively evaluated. Scan data were anonymously obtained and reconstructed in list-mode acquisition for a standard 2 min/bed position (bp), 1 min/bp and 30 s/bp (100%, 50% and 25% time or applied activity, respectively). Scans were randomized and read by two nuclear medicine physicians in a consensus read. Readers were blind to clinical details. Scans were evaluated for the number of pathological lesions detected. Measured uptake for lesions was evaluated by maximum and mean standardized uptake value (SUVmax and SUVmean, respectively) and tumour-to-backround ratio (TBR) were compared. Agreement between the three acquisitions was compared by Krippendorf's alpha.

Results: Overall n = 100 lesions were identified in the 2 min and 1 min/bp acquisitions and n = 98 lesions in the 30 s/bp acquisitions. Agreement between the three acquisitions with respect to lesion number and tumour-to-background ratio showed almost perfect agreement (K's α = 0.999). SUVmax, SUVmean and TBR likewise showed > 98% agreement, with longer acquisitions being associated with slightly higher mean TBR (2 min/bp 7.94 ± 4.41 versus 30 s/bp 7.84 ± 4.22, p < 0.05).

Conclusion: Shorter acquisition times have traditionally been associated with reduced lesion detectability or the requirement for larger amounts of radiotracer activity. These data confirm that this is not the case for new-generation digital PET scanners, where the known higher sensitivity results in clinically adequate images for shorter acquisitions. Only a small variation in the semi-quantitative parameters SUVmax, SUVmean and TBR was seen, confirming that either reduction of acquisition time or (by analogy) applied activity can be reduced as much as 75% in digital PET/CT without apparent clinical detriment.

TITLE: Reshaping the Amyloid Buildup Curve in Alzheimer Disease? Partial-Volume Effect Correction of Longitudinal Amyloid PET Data

AUTHORS: Michael Rullmann, Anke McLeod, Michel J Grothe, Osama Sabri, Henryk Barthel, Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
It was hypothesized that the brain β-amyloid buildup curve plateaus at an early symptomatic stage of Alzheimer disease (AD). Atrophy-related partial-volume effects (PVEs) degrade signal in hot-spot imaging techniques such as amyloid PET. The current study, a longitudinal analysis of amyloid-sensitive PET data, investigated the effect on the shape of the β-amyloid curve in AD when PVE correction (PVEC) is applied.Methods:We analyzed baseline and 2-y follow-up data for 216 symptomatic individuals on the AD continuum (positive amyloid status) enrolled in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (17 with AD dementia and 199 with mild cognitive impairment), including18F-florbetapir PET, MRI, and Mini Mental State Examination scores. For PVEC, the modified Müller-Gärtner method was performed.Results:Compared with non-PVE-corrected data, PVE-corrected data yielded significantly higher changes in regional and composite SUV ratio (SUVR) over time (P= 0.0002 for composite SUVRs). Longitudinal SUVR changes in relation to Mini Mental State Examination decreases showed a significantly higher slope for the regression line in the PVE-corrected than in the non-PVE-corrected PET data (F1= 7.1,P= 0.008).Conclusion:These PVEC results indicate that the β-amyloid buildup curve does not plateau at an early symptomatic disease stage. A further evaluation of the impact of PVEC on the in vivo characterization of time-dependent AD pathology, including the reliable assessment and comparison of other amyloid tracers, is warranted.

TITLE: Pulmonary blood flow quantification in humans from 15O-water PET

AUTHORS: Oona Rainio, Henri Kärpijoki, Juhani Knuuti, Riku Klén

JOURNAL: Annals of nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) imaging has commonly been applied to study blood perfusion in the human brain and heart, but there is a very limited amount of existing research about the suitability of this method for many other organs of interest. Here, we focus on the quantification of pulmonary blood flow (PBF) in human lungs. We evaluate both the potential of theO-water PET imaging via compartmental modeling with automatic volume of interest (VOI) selection for PBF quantification and study the possible differences in PBF caused by different patient characteristics such as age or sex.

Procedures: We systematically fit the one-tissue compartment model to the mean time-activity curves derived from theO-water PET data of 103 patients. The machine learning-based segmentation tool TotalSegmentator is utilized to find segmentation masks for different lung lobes and right ventricle of the heart. Additionally, we automatically remove the majority of the air inside the lung lobe VOIs and the areas surrounding subclavian arteries and brachiocephalic veins with the help of binary erosion and dilatation operations. After the model fitting, we evaluate possible differences in the results caused by age, sex, weight, and body mass index (BMI) by performing Mann-Whitney U tests between different patient subgroups and computing Spearman's correlations coefficients.

Results: The estimated PBF within all the lung lobes had a mean of1.21±0.825 mL/min/cmand a median of 1.03 mL/min/cm, but this value was notably lower in right lower lung lobe and much higher in the upper lung lobes. The PBF was higher in both the female patients and in the patients under 65 years but not statistically significantly so. The individual variation was very high.

Conclusions: The PBF quantification based onO-water PET imaging combined with our automatic VOI selection method is an effective method to produce relatively realistic results. In case of upper lung lobes, the results are likely overestimated if pulmonary vessels are not removed from the VOI. The accurate estimation of the air volume within the lung lobe VOIs is also a non-trivial problem. More research on this topic is warranted to find whether there is a decreasing trend between PBF and age or significant differences between the sexes.

TITLE: Machine Learning Algorithms for Early Detection of Bone Metastases in an Experimental Rat Model

AUTHORS: Stephan Ellmann, Lisa Seyler, Clarissa Gillmann, Vanessa Popp, Christoph Treutlein, Aline Bozec, Michael Uder, Tobias Bäuerle

JOURNAL: Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Machine learning (ML) algorithms permit the integration of different features into a model to perform classification or regression tasks with an accuracy exceeding its constituents. This protocol describes the development of an ML algorithm to predict the growth of breast cancer bone macrometastases in a rat model before any abnormalities are observable with standard imaging methods. Such an algorithm can facilitate the detection of early metastatic disease (i.e., micrometastasis) that is regularly missed during staging examinations. The applied metastasis model is site-specific, meaning that the rats develop metastases exclusively in their right hind leg. The model's tumor-take rate is 60%-80%, with macrometastases becoming visible in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) in a subset of animals 30 days after induction, whereas a second subset of animals exhibit no tumor growth. Starting from image examinations acquired at an earlier time point, this protocol describes the extraction of features that indicate tissue vascularization detected by MRI, glucose metabolism by PET/CT, and the subsequent determination of the most relevant features for the prediction of macrometastatic disease. These features are then fed into a model-averaged neural network (avNNet) to classify the animals into one of two groups: one that will develop metastases and the other that will not develop any tumors. The protocol also describes the calculation of standard diagnostic parameters, such as overall accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, negative/positive predictive values, likelihood ratios, and the development of a receiver operating characteristic. An advantage of the proposed protocol is its flexibility, as it can be easily adapted to train a plethora of different ML algorithms with adjustable combinations of an unlimited number of features. Moreover, it can be used to analyze different problems in oncology, infection, and inflammation.

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Comparison studies using histopathology as standard of reference enable a validation of the diagnostic performance of imaging methods. This study analysed (1) the impact of different image-histopathology co-registration pathways, (2) the impact of the applied data analysis method and (3) intraindividually compared multiparametric magnet resonance tomography (mpMRI) and prostate specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography (PSMA-PET) by using the different approaches. Ten patients with primary PCa who underwent mpMRI and [18F]PSMA-1007 PET/CT followed by prostatectomy were prospectively enrolled. We demonstrate that the choice of the intermediate registration step [(1) via ex-vivo CT or (2) mpMRI] does not significantly affect the performance of the registration framework. Comparison of analysis methods revealed that methods using high spatial resolutions e.g. quadrant-based slice-by-slice analysis are beneficial for a differentiated analysis of performance, compared to methods with a lower resolution (segment-based analysis with 6 or 18 segments and lesions-based analysis). Furthermore, PSMA-PET outperformed mpMRI for intraprostatic PCa detection in terms of sensitivity (median %: 83-85 vs. 60-69, p < 0.04) with similar specificity (median %: 74-93.8 vs. 100) using both registration pathways. To conclude, the choice of an intermediate registration pathway does not significantly affect registration performance, analysis methods with high spatial resolution are preferable and PSMA-PET outperformed mpMRI in terms of sensitivity in our cohort.

TITLE: Relationship between tumor heterogeneity and volume in cervical cancer: Evidence from integrated fluorodeoxyglucose 18 PET/MR texture analysis

AUTHORS: Junjie Jin, Ke Wu, Xiaoran Li, Yang Yu, Xinghao Wang, Hongzan Sun

JOURNAL: Nuclear medicine communications

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of cervical cancer volume on PET/magnetic resonance (MR) texture heterogeneity.

Materials and methods: We retrospectively analyzed the PET/MR images of 138 patients with pathologically diagnosed cervical squamous cell carcinoma, including 50 patients undergoing surgery and 88 patients receiving concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Fluorodeoxyglucose 18 (18FDG)-PET/MR examination were performed for each patient before treatment, and the PET and MR texture analysis were undertaken. The texture features of the tumor based on gray-level co-occurrence matrices were extracted, and the correlation between tumor texture features and volume parameters was analyzed using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. Finally, the variation trend of tumor texture heterogeneity was analyzed as tumor volumes increased.

Results: PET texture features were highly correlated with metabolic tumor volume (MTV), including entropy-log2, entropy-log10, energy, homogeneity, dissimilarity, contrast, correlation, and the correlation coefficients (rs) were 0.955, 0.955, -0.897, 0.883, -0.881, -0.876, and 0.847 (P < 0.001), respectively. In the range of smaller MTV, the texture heterogeneity of energy, entropy-log2, and entropy-log10 increases with an increase in tumor volume, whereas the texture heterogeneity of homogeneity, dissimilarity, contrast, and correlation decreases with an increase in tumor volume. Only homogeneity, contrast, correlation, and dissimilarity had high correlation with tumor volume on MRI. The correlation coefficients (rs) were 0.76, -0.737, 0.644, and -0.739 (P < 0.001), respectively. The texture heterogeneity of MRI features that are highly correlated with tumor volume decreases with increasing tumor volume.

Conclusion: In the small tumor volume range, the heterogeneity variation trend of PET texture features is inconsistent as the tumor volume increases, but the variation trend of MRI texture heterogeneity is consistent, and MRI texture heterogeneity decreases as tumor volume increases. These results suggest that MRI is a better imaging modality when compared with PET in determining tumor texture heterogeneity in the small tumor volume range.

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
The value of interim18F-FDG PET/CT (iPET)-guided treatment decisions in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) has been the subject of much debate. This investigation focuses on a comparison of the Deauville score and the change-in-SUVmax(ΔSUVmax) approach-2 methods to assess early metabolic response to standard chemotherapy in DLBCL.Methods:Of 609 DLBCL patients participating in the PET-Guided Therapy of Aggressive Non-Hodgkin Lymphomas trial, iPET scans of 596 patients originally evaluated using the ΔSUVmaxmethod were available for post hoc assessment of the Deauville score. A commonly used definition of an unfavorable iPET result according to the Deauville score is an uptake greater than that of the liver, whereas an unfavorable iPET scan with regard to the ΔSUVmaxapproach is characterized as a relative reduction of the SUVmaxbetween baseline and iPET staging of less than or equal to 66%. We investigated the 2 methods' correlation and concordance by Spearman rank correlation coefficient and the agreement in classification, respectively. We further used Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression to assess differences in survival between patient subgroups defined by the prespecified cutoffs. Time-dependent receiver-operating-characteristic curve analysis provided information on the methods' respective discrimination performance.Results:Deauville score and ΔSUVmaxapproach differed in their iPET-based prognosis. The ΔSUVmaxapproach outperformed the Deauville score in terms of discrimination performance-most likely because of a high number of false-positive decisions by the Deauville score. Cutoff-independent discrimination performance remained low for both methods, but cutoff-related analyses showed promising results. Both favored the ΔSUVmaxapproach, for example, for the segregation by iPET response, where the event-free survival hazard ratio was 3.14 (95% confidence interval, 2.22-4.46) for ΔSUVmaxand 1.70 (95% confidence interval, 1.29-2.24) for the Deauville score.Conclusion:When considering treatment intensification, the currently used Deauville score cutoff of an uptake above that of the liver seems to be inappropriate and associated with potential harm for DLBCL patients. The ΔSUVmaxcriterion of a relative reduction in SUVmaxof less than or equal to 66% should be considered as an alternative.

TITLE: Investigation of cortical thickness and volume during spontaneous attacks of migraine without aura: a 3-Tesla MRI study

AUTHORS: Faisal Mohammad Amin, Roberto De Icco, Mohammad Al-Mahdi Al-Karagholi, Jayachandra M Raghava, Frauke Wolfram, Henrik B W Larsson, Messoud Ashina

JOURNAL: The journal of headache and pain

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Background: Structural imaging has revealed changes in cortical thickness in migraine patients compared to healthy controls is reported, but presence of dynamic cortical and subcortical changes during migraine attack versus inter-ictal phase is unknown. The aim of the present study was to investigate possible changes in cortical thickness during spontaneous migraine attacks. We hypothesized that pain-related cortical area would be affected during the attack compared to an inter-ictal phase.

Methods: Twenty-five patients with migraine without aura underwent three-dimensional T1-weighted imaging on a 3-Tesla MRI scanner during spontaneous and untreated migraine attacks. Subsequently, 20 patients were scanned in the inter-ictal phase, while 5 patients did not show up for the inter-ictal scan. Four patients were excluded from the analysis because of bilateral migraine pain and another one patient was excluded due to technical error in the imaging. Longitudinal image processing was done using FreeSurfer. Repeated measures ANOVA was used for statistical analysis and to control for multiple comparison the level of significance was set at p = 0.025.

Results: In a total of 15 patients, we found reduced cortical thickness of the precentral (p = 0.023), pericalcarine (p = 0.024), and temporal pole (p = 0.017) cortices during the attack compared to the inter-ictal phase. Cortical volume was reduced in prefrontal (p = 0.018) and pericalcarine (p = 0.017) cortices. Hippocampus volume was increased during attack (p = 0.007). We found no correlations between the pain side or any other clinical parameters and the reduced cortical size.

Conclusion: Spontaneous migraine attacks are accompanied by transient reduced cortical thickness and volume in pain-related areas. The findings constitute a fingerprint of acute pain in migraine patients, which can be used as a possible biomarker to predict antimigraine treatment effect in future studies.

Trial registration: The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02202486).

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
We previously presented the radiolabeled ammonium salt [11C]-dimethyl diphenylammonium trifluoromethanesulfonate ([11C]DMDPA) as a potential novel PET-MPI agent. The current study aimed to increase the clinical applicability of PET-MPI by designing and synthesizing fluorinated ammonium salt derivatives. Four fluorinated DMDPA derivatives and two quinolinium salt analogs were radiolabeled. The dynamic distribution in vivo, following injection of each derivative into male SD rats, was evaluated using small-animal dedicated PET/CT. Organ uptake after injection of [18F]fluoroethylquinolinium acetate ([18F]FEtQ) was examined ex vivo. Four fluorinated DMDPA derivatives were synthesized, two were labeled with fluorine-18: [18F]fluoroethyl-methyldiphenylammonium trifluoromethanesulfonate ([18F]FEMDPA) and [18F]fluorobuthyl-methyldiphenylammonium trifluoromethanesulfonate ([18F]FBMDPA). The other two were labeled using carbon-11: [11C]methyl-(3-fluorophenyl)-methylphenylammonium trifluoromethanesulfonate ([11C]3-F-DMDPA) and [11C]methyl-(4-fluorophenyl)-methylphenylammonium trifluoromethanesulfonate ([11C]4-F-DMDPA). All four DMDPA derivatives exhibited significantly lower heart/liver radioactivity uptake ratios (0.6, 0.4, 0.7 and 0.6, respectively) compared to that of [11C]DMDPA (1.2). Conversely, the two radiolabeled quinolinium salt derivatives, [11C]methylquinolinium iodide ([11C]MeQ) and [18F]FEtQ demonstrated improved heart/liver ratios (2.0 and 1.3, respectively) with clear visualization of the left ventricle myocardium. Renal clearance was the major route of elimination. Among the fluorinated quaternary ammonium salts tested, [18F]FEtQ yielded the best images. Further studies are in progress to elucidate the underlying mechanism of its cardiac uptake.

TITLE: Detection and quantification of small and low-uptake lesions for differentiated thyroid carcinoma using non-time-of-flight iodine-124 PET/MRI

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Background: 124-iodine (124I) is used for positron emission tomography (PET) diagnostics and therapy planning in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC). Small lesion sizes (<10 mm) and low124I uptake are challenging conditions for the detection of DTC lymph node lesions.

Purpose: The aim of this study was to systematically investigate the lesion detectability and quantification performance under clinically challenging imaging conditions using non-time-of-flight (TOF) PET/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the clinical context of radionuclide therapy planning of DTC patients.

Methods: PET/MR measurements were performed on the Siemens Biograph mMR using a small lesion NEMA-like phantom (six glass spheres, diameters 3.7-9.7 mm). 60 min list-mode data were acquired for nine activity concentrations (AC) ranging from 25 kBq/mL to 0.25 kBq/mL using a sphere-to-background ratio of 20:1. PET list-mode data were divided into five timeframes (60, 30, 16, 8, and 4 min) and reconstructed using either ordered-subsets expectation maximization (OSEM) or OSEM+ point spread function (PSF) algorithm. For all reconstructions, the smallest detectable sphere size was investigated in a human observer study. Partial volume effect (PVE) corrected PET images (contour and oversize-based approach) were analyzed considering a ± 30% deviation range between imaged and true AC as acceptable. Clinical data of eight DTC patients with small lymph node lesions were evaluated to assess agreement between the PVE correction approaches.

Results: Longer PET acquisition times, higher ACs, and PSF reconstructions resulted in improved PET image quality and overall improved lesion detectability. The smallest 3.7 mm sphere was only visible under the best imaging conditions. Using a typical clinical124I whole-body PET/MRI protocol with an acquisition time of 8 min using OSEM reconstructions, all lesions of ≥ 6.5 mm in diameter could be detected and the quantification provided reliable results approximately above 5.0 kBq/mL. An accurate quantification of ACs in the 4.8 mm sphere was not feasible in this study. In the clinical evaluation of 10 lesions, a good agreement between oversize- and contour-based PVE corrections was observed (<15% deviation).

Conclusions: The results showed that a reliable quantification of124I uptake with PET/MRI is feasible and, therefore, could be used to perform radioiodine pre-therapy lesion dosimetry and individualized therapy planning in DTC patients.

TITLE: Short-term repeatability of myocardial blood flow using 82Rb PET/CT: The effect of arterial input function position and motion correction

AUTHORS: Yuka Otaki, Martin Lyngby Lassen, Osamu Manabe, Evann Eisenberg, Heidi Gransar, Frances Wang, Yoon Jae Lee, Evangelos Tzolos, Daniel S Berman, Piotr J Slomka

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear cardiology : official publication of the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Background: We tested the repeatability of myocardial blood flow (MBF) quantified using82Rb with and without motion correction (MC) and with arterial input functions estimated from left ventricle (LV) and atrium (LA).

Methods: Twenty-one patients referred for clinical82Rb PET/CT underwent repeated rest scans in a single imaging session. Global MBF was quantified using three different assessments by two operators: (1) automatic processing without MC and LV arterial input function (AIF), (2) with MC and LV-AIF, and (3) with MC and LA-AIF. Inter-scan and inter-operator repeatability were tested using coefficient of variation (CV).

Results: MC with LV-AIF did not change MBF (no MC: 1.01 ± 0.30 mL/min/g vs MC with LV-AIF: 1.01 ± 0.29, P = 0.70), whereas MC with LA-AIF showed significantly lower MBF assessments (0.95 ± 0.28 mL/min/g, P = 0.0006). We report significant improvement for test-retest reproducibility for global MBF following MC (CV; No MC: 16.0, MC (LV-AIF): 9.2, MC (LA-AIF): 8.8). Good inter-operator repeatability was observed for LV-AIF (CV = 4.7) and LA-AIF (CV = 5.6) for global MBF assessments.

Conclusions: MC significantly improved the test-retest repeatability between operators and between scans. MBF obtained after MC with LV-AIF were comparable, whereas MBFs after MC and LA-AIF were significantly reduced.

TITLE: Iterative reconstruction incorporating background correction improves quantification of [18F]-NaF PET/CT images of patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm

AUTHORS: Mercy I Akerele, Nicolas A Karakatsanis, Rachael O Forsythe, Marc R Dweck, Maaz Syed, Robert G Aykroyd, Steven Sourbron, David E Newby, Charalampos Tsoumpas

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear cardiology : official publication of the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Background: A confounding issue in [18F]-NaF PET/CT imaging of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) is the spill in contamination from the bone into the aneurysm. This study investigates and corrects for this spill in contamination using the background correction (BC) technique without the need to manually exclude the part of the AAA region close to the bone.

Methods: Seventy-two (72) datasets of patients with AAA were reconstructed with the standard ordered subset expectation maximization (OSEM) algorithm incorporating point spread function (PSF) modelling. The spill in effect in the aneurysm was investigated using two target regions of interest (ROIs): one covering the entire aneurysm (AAA), and the other covering the aneurysm but excluding the part close to the bone (AAAexc). ROI analysis was performed by comparing the maximum SUV in the target ROI (SUVmax(T)), the corrected cSUVmax(SUVmax(T) - SUVmean(B)) and the target-to-blood ratio (TBR = SUVmax(T)/SUVmean(B)) with respect to the mean SUV in the right atrium region.

Results: There is a statistically significant higher [18F]-NaF uptake in the aneurysm than normal aorta and this is not correlated with the aneurysm size. There is also a significant difference in aneurysm uptake for OSEM and OSEM + PSF (but not OSEM + PSF + BC) when quantifying with AAA and AAAexcdue to the spill in from the bone. This spill in effect depends on proximity of the aneurysms to the bone as close aneurysms suffer more from spill in than farther ones.

Conclusion: The background correction (OSEM + PSF + BC) technique provided more robust AAA quantitative assessments regardless of the AAA ROI delineation method, and thus it can be considered as an effective spill in correction method for [18F]-NaF AAA studies.

TITLE: Quantitative Total-Body Imaging of Blood Flow with High-Temporal-Resolution Early Dynamic 18F-FDG PET Kinetic Modeling

AUTHORS: Kevin J Chung, Abhijit J Chaudhari, Lorenzo Nardo, Terry Jones, Moon S Chen Jr, Ramsey D Badawi, Simon R Cherry, Guobao Wang

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Past efforts to measure blood flow with the widely available radiotracer18F-FDG were limited to tissues with high18F-FDG extraction fraction. In this study, we developed an early dynamic18F-FDG PET method with high-temporal-resolution (HTR) kinetic modeling to assess total-body blood flow based on deriving the vascular phase of18F-FDG transit and conducted a pilot comparison study against a11C-butanol flow-tracer reference.Methods:The first 2 min of dynamic PET scans were reconstructed at HTR (60 × 1 s/frame, 30 × 2 s/frame) to resolve the rapid passage of the radiotracer through blood vessels. In contrast to existing methods that use blood-to-tissue transport rate as a surrogate of blood flow, our method directly estimated blood flow using a distributed kinetic model (adiabatic approximation to tissue homogeneity [AATH] model). To validate our18F-FDG measurements of blood flow against a reference flow-specific radiotracer, we analyzed total-body dynamic PET images of 6 human participants scanned with both18F-FDG and11C-butanol. An additional 34 total-body dynamic18F-FDG PET images of healthy participants were analyzed for comparison against published blood-flow ranges. Regional blood flow was estimated across the body, and total-body parametric imaging of blood flow was conducted for visual assessment. AATH and standard compartment model fitting was compared using the Akaike information criterion at different temporal resolutions.Results:18F-FDG blood flow was in quantitative agreement with flow measured from11C-butanol across same-subject regional measurements (Pearson correlation coefficient, 0.955;P< 0.001; linear regression slope and intercept, 0.973 and -0.012, respectively), which was visually corroborated by total-body blood-flow parametric imaging. Our method resolved a wide range of blood-flow values across the body in broad agreement with published ranges (e.g., healthy cohort values of 0.51 ± 0.12 mL/min/cm3in the cerebral cortex and 2.03 ± 0.64 mL/min/cm3in the lungs). HTR (1-2 s/frame) was required for AATH modeling.Conclusion:Total-body blood-flow imaging was feasible using early dynamic18F-FDG PET with HTR kinetic modeling. This method may be combined with standard18F-FDG PET methods to enable efficient single-tracer multiparametric flow-metabolism imaging, with numerous research and clinical applications in oncology, cardiovascular disease, pain medicine, and neuroscience.

TITLE: New compartment model for hepatic blood flow quantification in humans from 15O-water PET images

AUTHORS: Oona Rainio, Juhani Knuuti, Riku Klén

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Background: Different compartment models are commonly used to derive crucial information about blood flow, metabolism, and oxygenation from the results of a dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) scan. However, compared to blood flow in many other organs of interest, the hepatic blood flow (HBF) quantification is challenging due to the dual blood supply of liver from both the hepatic artery and the portal vein (PV). Here, we introduce a new model that can be used to estimate the HBF in combination with an automatic volume of interest selection method.

Materials and methods: By using theO-water PET data of 57 patients, we extract the mean time-activity curves (TACs) from aorta, hepatic PV, liver, and spleen with help of an automated computer tomography-based segmentation tool and systematically fit our new compartment model and three earlier compartment models from literature to the TACs. After this, we compare the model performance with mean relative error (MRE), mean squared error, and Akaike's information criteria with one-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. After determining the best model, we study possible HBF differences caused by age, sex, and weight with Mann-Whitney U test and Pearson's correlations coefficient.

Results: We obtained the mean arterial HBF of 0.299±0.168 mL/min/mL, the mean portal HBF of 0.930±0.520 mL/min/mL, and the total HBF of 1.229±0.612 mL/min/mL with our new model. Based on earlier research, both these estimates and also the results of two earlier versions of the original dual-input model are realistic. Out of these three models, our proposed model performed the best in terms of MRE (p-values≤0.001). According to our results, there are no significant sex- or age-based differences but there is moderate positive correlation between the arterial and portal HBFs and negative correlation between the total HBF and the weight of patients.

Conclusion: The HBF can effectively be estimated fromO-water PET data with our new model in combination with robust segmentation by TotalSegmentator. Due to the fact that potential underestimation of the PV concentration caused by the small size of this vessel might lead to overestimation of the HBF, more research would be beneficial to validate these methods further. Our results suggests that there is a negative trend between the HBF and the weight, though this might be related to the underlying conditions of the patients.

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Several studies have demonstrated strong agreement between routine clinical visual assessment and quantification, suggesting that quantification approaches could support assessment by less experienced readers or in challenging cases. However, all studies to date have implemented a retrospective case collection, and challenging cases were generally underrepresented.Methods:We included all participants (n= 741) from the AMYPAD diagnostic and patient management study with available baseline amyloid PET quantification. Quantification was done with the PET-only AmyPype pipeline, providing global Centiloid and regionalzscores. Visual assessment was performed by local readers for the entire cohort. From the total cohort, we selected a subsample of 85 cases for which the amyloid status based on the local reader's visual assessment and the Centiloid classification (cutoff = 21) was discordant or that were assessed with low confidence (i.e., ≤3 on a 5-point scale) by the local reader. In addition, concordant negative (n= 8) and positive (n= 8) scans across tracers were selected. In this sample (n= 101 cases; [18F]flutemetamol,n= 48; [18F]florbetaben,n= 53), the visual assessments and corresponding confidence by 5 certified independent central readers were captured before and after disclosure of the quantification results.Results:For the whole AMYPAD diagnostic and patient management study cohort, overall assessment by local readers highly agreed with Centiloid status (κ = 0.85, 92.3% agreement). This was consistently observed within disease stages (subjective cognitive decline-plus, κ = 0.82, 92.3% agreement; mild cognitive impairment, κ = 0.80, 89.8% agreement; dementia, κ = 0.87, 94.6% agreement). Across all central reader assessments in the challenging subsample, quantification of global Centiloid and regionalzscores was considered supportive of visual reads in 70.3% and 49.3% of assessments, respectively. After disclosure of the quantitative results, we observed improvement in concordance across the 5 readers (baseline κ = 0.65, 65.3% agreement; κ after disclosure = 0.74, 73.3% agreement) and a significant increase in reader confidence (baseline mean (M) = 4.0 vs.Mafter disclosure = 4.34, Wilcoxon statistic (W) = 101,056,P< 0.001).Conclusion:In this clinical study enriched for challenging amyloid PET cases, we demonstrate the value of quantification to support visual assessment. After disclosure, both interreader agreement and confidence showed significant improvement. These results are important considering the arrival of antiamyloid therapies, which used the Centiloid metric for trial inclusion and target engagement. Moreover, quantification could support determination of amyloid-β status with high certainty, an important factor for treatment initiation.

TITLE: Multimodal Brain Tumor Classification Using Convolutional Tumnet Architecture

AUTHORS: M Padma Usha, G Kannan, M Ramamoorthy

JOURNAL: Behavioural neurology

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
The most common and aggressive tumor is brain malignancy, which has a short life span in the fourth grade of the disease. As a result, the medical plan may be a crucial step toward improving the well-being of a patient. Both diagnosis and therapy are part of the medical plan. Brain tumors are commonly imaged with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and computed tomography (CT). In this paper, multimodal fused imaging with classification and segmentation for brain tumors was proposed using the deep learning method. The MRI and CT brain tumor images of the same slices (308 slices of meningioma and sarcoma) are combined using three different types of pixel-level fusion methods. The presence/absence of a tumor is classified using the proposed Tumnet technique, and the tumor area is found accordingly. In the other case, Tumnet is also applied for single-modal MRI/CT (561 image slices) for classification. The proposed Tumnet was modeled with 5 convolutional layers, 3 pooling layers with ReLU activation function, and 3 fully connected layers. The first-order statistical fusion metrics for an average method of MRI-CT images are obtained as SSIM tissue at 83%, SSIM bone at 84%, accuracy at 90%, sensitivity at 96%, and specificity at 95%, and the second-order statistical fusion metrics are obtained as the standard deviation of fused images at 79% and entropy at 0.99. The entropy value confirms the presence of additional features in the fused image. The proposed Tumnet yields a sensitivity of 96%, an accuracy of 98%, a specificity of 99%, normalized values of the mean of 0.75, a standard deviation of 0.4, a variance of 0.16, and an entropy of 0.90.

TITLE: Adding the temporal domain to PET radiomic features

AUTHORS: Wyanne A Noortman, Dennis Vriens, Cornelis H Slump, Johan Bussink, Tineke W H Meijer, Lioe-Fee de Geus-Oei, Floris H P van Velden

JOURNAL: PloS one

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Background: Radiomic features, extracted from positron emission tomography, aim to characterize tumour biology based on tracer intensity, tumour geometry and/or tracer uptake heterogeneity. Currently, radiomic features are derived from static images. However, temporal changes in tracer uptake might reveal new aspects of tumour biology. This study aims to explore additional information of these novel dynamic radiomic features compared to those derived from static or metabolic rate images.

Methods: Thirty-five patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma underwent dynamic [18F]FDG PET/CT scans. Spatial intensity, shape and texture radiomic features were derived from volumes of interest delineated on static PET and parametric metabolic rate PET. Dynamic grey level cooccurrence matrix (GLCM) and grey level run length matrix (GLRLM) features, assessing the temporal domain unidirectionally, were calculated on eight and sixteen time frames of equal length. Spearman's rank correlations of parametric and dynamic features with static features were calculated to identify features with potential additional information. Survival analysis was performed for the non-redundant temporal features and a selection of static features using Kaplan-Meier analysis.

Results: Three out of 90 parametric features showed moderate correlations with corresponding static features (ρ≥0.61), all other features showed high correlations (ρ>0.7). Dynamic features are robust independent of frame duration. Five out of 22 dynamic GLCM features showed a negligible to moderate correlation with any static feature, suggesting additional information. All sixteen dynamic GLRLM features showed high correlations with static features, implying redundancy. Log-rank analyses of Kaplan-Meier survival curves for all features dichotomised at the median were insignificant.

Conclusion: This study suggests that, compared to static features, some dynamic GLCM radiomic features show different information, whereas parametric features provide minimal additional information. Future studies should be conducted in larger populations to assess whether there is a clinical benefit of radiomics using the temporal domain over traditional radiomics.

AUTHORS: Ha Wu, Guobing Liu, Xiemei Ruan, Biying Zhang, Zheng Zhe, Hongcheng Shi

JOURNAL: Annals of nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Objective: To explore the feasibility of a low-dose18F-FDG protocol for the 30-cm standard axial field of view (SAFOV) PET/CT imaging in pediatric patients.

Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 112 pediatric patients who underwent a full-dose (3.7 MBq/kg)18F-FDG PET/CT imaging, and a prospective analysis was performed on 55 patients who received a low-dose (2.5 MBq/kg) imaging. PET images were reconstructed at 1.0-min/bed intervals, and labeled as G1.0, G2.0, G3.0 for the full-dose imaging and G1.0', G2.0', G3.0' for the low-dose imaging. Patients were categorized into three age groups, and the image quality was assessed using the Likert scale and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR); Lesion detectability was evaluated using lesion detection rates and the target-to-liver ratio (TLR).

Results: In G2.0 and G3.0, all cases (112/112) achieved an image score of ≥ 3 and a lesion detection rate of 100% (98/98). There were no significant differences in SNR between G2.0 and G3.0 (11.09 ± 2.31 vs. 11.88 ± 2.58, p = 0.39), nor between age groups ≤ 5 years and 6-10 years groups (9.52 ± 3.16 vs. 9.53 ± 3.19, p = 0.99). In G3.0', 98.2% of cases (54/55) had an image score ≥ 3 and a lesion detection rate of 100% (43/43). The SNR of every age group for G3.0' was comparable to that of G2.0, and no significant differences between ≤ 5 years and 6-10 years groups (9.32 ± 1.94 vs. 9.99 ± 2.28, p = 0.82).

Conclusions: A 2.5 MBq/kg dose with a 3.0 min/bed acquisition protocol is feasible for18F-FDG 30-cm SAFOV PET/CT imaging in pediatric patients, and SNR and TLR demonstrated age-dependent discrepancies.

TITLE: Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging Microstructural Abnormalities in Multiple System Atrophy: A Comprehensive Review

AUTHORS: Jacopo Pasquini, Michael J Firbank, Roberto Ceravolo, Vincenzo Silani, Nicola Pavese

JOURNAL: Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by autonomic failure, ataxia, and/or parkinsonism. Its prominent pathological alterations can be investigated using diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI), a technique that exploits the characteristics of water random motion inside brain tissue. The aim of this report was to review currently available literature on the application of dMRI in MSA and to describe microstructural abnormalities, diagnostic applications, and pathophysiological correlates. Sixty-four published studies involving microstructural investigation using dMRI in MSA were included. Widespread microstructural abnormalities of white matter were described, especially in the middle cerebellar peduncle, corticospinal tract, and hemispheric fibers. Gray matter degeneration was identified as well, with diffuse involvement of subcortical structures, especially in the putamina. Diagnostic applications of dMRI were mostly explored for the differential diagnosis between MSA parkinsonism and Parkinson's disease. Recently, machine learning algorithms for image processing and disease classification have demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy, showing potential for translation into clinical practice. To a lesser extent, clinical correlates of microstructural abnormalities have also been investigated, and abnormalities related to motor, ocular, and cognitive impairments were described. dMRI in MSA has contributed to in vivo identification of known pathological abnormalities. Translation into clinical practice of the latest advancements for the differential diagnosis between MSA and other forms of parkinsonism seems feasible. Current limitations involve the possibility of correctly diagnosing MSA in the very early stages, when the clinical diagnosis is most uncertain. Furthermore, pathophysiological correlates of microstructural abnormalities remain understudied. © 2022 The Authors.

ABSTRACT:
Manual segmentation poses a time-consuming challenge for disease quantification, therapy evaluation, treatment planning, and outcome prediction. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) hold promise in accurately identifying tumor locations and boundaries in PET scans. However, a major hurdle is the extensive amount of supervised and annotated data necessary for training. To overcome this limitation, this study explores semi-supervised approaches utilizing unlabeled data, specifically focusing on PET images of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL) obtained from two centers. We considered 2-[18F]FDG PET images of 292 patients PMBCL (n = 104) and DLBCL (n = 188) (n = 232 for training and validation, and n = 60 for external testing). We harnessed classical wisdom embedded in traditional segmentation methods, such as the fuzzy clustering loss function (FCM), to tailor the training strategy for a 3D U-Net model, incorporating both supervised and unsupervised learning approaches. Various supervision levels were explored, including fully supervised methods with labeled FCM and unified focal/Dice loss, unsupervised methods with robust FCM (RFCM) and Mumford-Shah (MS) loss, and semi-supervised methods combining FCM with supervised Dice loss (MS + Dice) or labeled FCM (RFCM + FCM). The unified loss function yielded higher Dice scores (0.73 ± 0.11; 95% CI 0.67-0.8) than Dice loss (p value < 0.01). Among the semi-supervised approaches, RFCM + αFCM (α = 0.3) showed the best performance, with Dice score of 0.68 ± 0.10 (95% CI 0.45-0.77), outperforming MS + αDice for any supervision level (any α) (p < 0.01). Another semi-supervised approach with MS + αDice (α = 0.2) achieved Dice score of 0.59 ± 0.09 (95% CI 0.44-0.76) surpassing other supervision levels (p < 0.01). Given the time-consuming nature of manual delineations and the inconsistencies they may introduce, semi-supervised approaches hold promise for automating medical imaging segmentation workflows.

TITLE: 68Ga-DOTATATE PET-CT as a tool for radiation planning and evaluating treatment responses in the clinical management of meningiomas

AUTHORS: Emily S Kowalski, Rahul Khairnar, Anton A Gryaznov, Vivek Kesari, Antony Koroulakis, Prashant Raghavan, Wengen Chen, Graeme Woodworth, Mark Mishra

JOURNAL: Radiation oncology (London, England)

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Background and purpose: Meningiomas express the somatostatin receptor (SSTR), which normal bone and brain lack. PET imaging with SSTR ligands such as68Ga-DOTATATE have been recently shown to aid in the imaging and identification of menginiomas. We hypothesize that68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT in conjunction with MRI aids in radiation (RT) target volume delineation and evaluating treatment response.

Materials and methods: Nineteen patients with meningiomas underwent68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT and MRI for RT planning and/or post-treatment follow-up. Meningiomas were grade I (n = 9) or not biopsied (n = 8) and frequently involved base of skull (n = 10). Ten (53%) patients received post-operative RT and 9 (47%) received fractaionted RT. In the subgroup that underwent both pre- and post-RT68Ga-DOTATATE PET as well as MRI (n = 10), ROVER (ABX GmbH, Radeberg, Germany) adaptive thresholding software was utilized to measure total lesion activity (mean and max) before and after treatment. Tumor volume based on MRI was calculated before and after treatment. Total lesion activity and tumor volume changes were compared using Wilcoxon signed rank test.

Results: 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT identified intraosseous (n = 4, 22%), falcine (n = 5, 26%) and satellite lesions (n = 3, 19%) and clarified the diagnosis of meningioma, resulting in a change in management in three patients. Mean total lesion activity decreased 14.7% (median), from pre to post-RT68Ga-DOTATATE PET [range 97-8.5% (25-75%),S = - 26.5, p = 0.0039]. Max total lesion activity decreased 36% (median) over the same period [range 105-15% (25-75%), S = - 26.5 p = 0.0039]. In contrast, meningioma volumes based on MRI measurements did not significantly change per RECIST criteria and Wilcoxon signed rank test (S = - 3, p = 0.7422).

Conclusion: 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT helped confirm suspected diagnoses and delineate target volumes particularly when lesions involved osseous structures and the falx. Mean and max total tumor68Ga-DOTATATE activity on PET/CT decreased at three months following RT despite stable tumor volumes on MRI. Future studies are warranted to (1) assess the sensitivity and specificity of68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT, (2) evaluate the impact of68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT-based planning on treatment outcomes, and (3) assess the prognostic significance of these post-treatment imaging changes.

TITLE: [18F]NaF PET-MRI provides direct in-vivo evidence of the association between bone metabolic activity and adjacent synovitis in knee osteoarthritis: a cross-sectional study

AUTHORS: J W MacKay, L Watkins, G Gold, F Kogan

JOURNAL: Osteoarthritis and cartilage

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Objective: Synovitis is hypothesized to play a role in the development and growth of osteophytes. Our objectives were to use hybrid positron emission tomography-magnetic resonance imaging (PET-MRI) to (1) determine whether synovitis adjacent to peripheral bone subregions with increased metabolic activity is greater than adjacent to regions without increased metabolic activity and (2) assess the association between subregional bone metabolic activity and adjacent synovitis.

Design: We recruited 11 participants (22 knees) with a diagnosis of OA in at least one knee. Simultaneous bilateral knee PET-MRI was performed. We quantified bone metabolic activity using the radiotracer [18F]sodium fluoride ([18F]NaF) with calculation of maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmax). Synovitis was quantified using dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI with calculation of Ktrans. Bone subregions were coded as osteophyte (OP), focal increased [18F]NaF uptake without osteophyte (FIU), or normal (no osteophyte or FIU). We used robust linear mixed effects models to assess differences in adjacent Ktransbetween different subregion types and to assess association between Ktransand adjacent SUVmax.

Results: 94 OPs were detected (59 MOAKS grade 1, 30 grade 2, 5 grade 3), along with 28 FIU and 18 normal subregions. Ktranswas higher adjacent to FIU (adjusted mean [95% CI] = 0.06 [0.03,0.09]) and OPs (0.08 [0.05,0.11]) when compared to normal bone subregions (0.03 [0.00,0.09]). PET SUVmaxwas positively associated with adjacent Ktrans(β[95% CI] = 0.018 [0.008,0.027]).

Conclusions: Synovitis is more intense adjacent to peripheral bone regions with increased metabolic activity than those without, although there is some overlap. Subregional bone metabolic activity is positively associated with intensity of adjacent synovitis.

TITLE: Quantification of myocardial blood flow (MBF) and reserve (MFR) incorporated with a novel segmentation approach: Assessments of quantitative precision and the lower limit of normal MBF and MFR in patients

AUTHORS: Hui Liu, Stephanie Thorn, Jing Wu, Ramesh Fazzone-Chettiar, Veronica Sandoval, Edward J Miller, Albert J Sinusas, Yi-Hwa Liu

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear cardiology : official publication of the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Background: Quantification of myocardial blood flow (MBF) and myocardial flow reserve (MFR) has shown diagnostic and prognostic values for the assessment of coronary artery disease (CAD). This study aimed to evaluate in patients a highly automatic Yale-MQ (myocardial blood flow quantification) software incorporated with a novel image segmentation approach for quantification of global and regional MBF and MFR from dynamic82Rb cardiac positron emission tomography (PET).

Methods: Global and regional MBFs and MFRs were quantified in 80 patients (18 normal and 62 CAD subjects) by two different observers using the Yale-MQ software. Lower limits of normal (LLN) values and intra- and inter-observer variabilities of MBFs and MFRs were calculated for the assessment of quantitative precision. The Yale-MQ was compared with a commercially available software (Corridor 4DM) being used as a reference.

Results: The Yale-MQ method provided precise assessments of LLNs of MBF and MFR. The global and regional MBFs and MFR quantified via Yale-MQ were correlated strongly with those via Corridor4DM (R ≥ 0.867). The intra- and inter-observer variabilities of MBFs and MFRs quantified via Yale-MQ were small (≤ 7.7% for MBFs and ≤ 10.0% for MFRs) with excellent correlations (R ≥ 0.980 for MBFs and R ≥ 0.976 for MFRs).

Conclusions: The new Yale-MQ software associated with the automatic processing scheme provides a highly reproducible clinical tool for precise quantification of MBF and MFR in patients with reliable LLN values.

AUTHORS: Dominic Bagguley, Sean Ong, James P Buteau, Sam Koschel, Nattakorn Dhiantravan, Michael S Hofman, Louise Emmett, Declan G Murphy, Nathan Lawrentschuk

JOURNAL: Future oncology (London, England)

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET/CT is a novel imaging technique for the detection and staging of either primary or recurrent prostate cancer. Early studies demonstrated its improved sensitivity and specificity over and in combination with other currently employed imaging techniques, such as multiparametric MRI, bone scan, PET and CT. However, the lack of strength and confidence in these studies has meant incorporation of PSMA PET/CT into clinical guidelines and practice has been limited to date. In response, a number of high-quality prospective studies have recently emerged and reflect exciting results seen in preceding publications. Here we recount some of the key earlier publications, report results from the latest studies and look to the future discussing some of the eagerly awaited ongoing clinical trials.

TITLE: Neural correlates of standing imagery and execution in Parkinsonian patients: The relevance to striatal dopamine dysfunction

AUTHORS: Yutaro Mori, Etsuji Yoshikawa, Masami Futatsubashi, Yasuomi Ouchi

JOURNAL: PloS one

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
It has been reported that the cerebellar vermis is equally involved in both motor imagery about axial movement and the actual execution of postural balance in healthy human subjects, but this finding is yet to be explored in Parkinson's disease (PD). We therefore investigated the neuronal responses during observation of standing posture, imagination of standing and the assumption of an upright posture in ten drug-naïve PD patients using positron emission tomography (PET) with [15O]H2O and evaluated dopamine dysfunction by measuring the level of dopamine transporter binding of [11C]CFT. Within-group statistical parametric mapping (SPM) analysis showed similar cerebellar activation during imagination of standing and its real execution between the PD and control groups (12 healthy subjects); i.e., increases in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) were observed in the anterior cerebellar vermis during motor imagination and the posterior vermis during standing. A comparison between the groups showed that the motor execution of standing significantly activated the superior part of the posterior vermis (declive VI) and the paracentral sulcus region in the PD patients, while the prefrontal cortices were deactivated during standing (p<0.001 uncorrected). Correlation analysis within the PD group revealed that the postural rCBF increases in the cerebellar vermis (pyramis) were negatively correlated with putaminal [11C]CFT binding (p<0.01, r = 0.94) and that the postural rCBF reductions in the orbitofrontal cortex were positively correlated with caudate [11C]CFT binding (p<0.05, r = 0.70). These results suggest that while the neural circuits for postural imagery and execution are intact in PD, standing performance, which requires more recruitment of dopaminergic control, may result in compensatory overstimulation of the cerebellar vermis and paracentral foot area in PD patients. Hyperactivity in these areas along with mesocortical hypofunction may be pathophysiological aspects of postural control in PD patients. Hence, our findings would help understand the modifications observed within the neural networks in relationship with postural performance, and possible compensatory mechanisms in PD.

TITLE: Positron Emission Tomography Imaging for In Vivo Measuring of Myelin Content in the Lysolecithin Rat Model of Multiple Sclerosis

AUTHORS: Daniele de Paula Faria, Caroline Cristiano Real, Larissa Estessi de Souza, Alexandre Teles Garcez, Fabio Luis Navarro Marques, Carlos Alberto Buchpiguel

JOURNAL: Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neuroinflammatory disease with expanding axonal and neuronal degeneration and demyelination in the central nervous system, leading to motor dysfunctions, psychical disability, and cognitive impairment during MS progression. Positron emission tomography (PET) is an imaging technique able to quantify in vivo cellular and molecular alterations. Radiotracers with affinity to intact myelin can be used for in vivo imaging of myelin content changes over time. It is possible to detect either an increase or decrease in myelin content, what means this imaging technique can detect demyelination and remyelination processes of the central nervous system. In this protocol we demonstrate how to use PET imaging to detect myelin changes in the lysolecithin rat model, which is a model of focal demyelination lesion (induced by stereotactic injection) (i.e., a model of multiple sclerosis disease).11C-PIB PET imaging was performed at baseline, and 1 week and 4 weeks after stereotaxic injection of lysolecithin 1% in the right striatum (4 µL) and corpus callosum (3 µL) of the rat brain, allowing quantification of focal demyelination (injection site after 1 week) and the remyelination process (injection site at 4 weeks). Myelin PET imaging is an interesting tool for monitoring in vivo changes in myelin content which could be useful for monitoring demyelinating disease progression and therapeutic response.

JOURNAL: PloS one

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Radiolabeled Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA) PET/CT is the current standard-of-care for lesion detection in patients with biochemically recurrent (BCR) prostate cancer (PCa). However, rigorous verification of detected lesions is not always performed in routine clinical practice. To aid future 18F-radiolabeled PSMA PET/CT interpretation, we aimed to identify clinical/imaging characteristics that increase the likelihood that a PSMA-avid lesion is malignant.

Materials and methods: 262 patients with BCR, who underwent 18F-DCFPyL PSMA PET/CT, were retrospectively analyzed. The malignant nature of 18F-DCFPyL PET-detected lesions was verified through any of the following metrics: (1) positive histopathological examination; (2) additional positive imaging; (3) a ≥50% decrease in Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) following irradiation of the lesion(s).

Results: In 226/262 PET scans (86.3%) at least one lesion suspicious for recurrent PCa was detected ('positive scan'). In 84/226 positive scans (37.2%), at least one independent verification metric was available. PSMA PET-detected lesions were most often confirmed to be malignant (PCa) in the presence of a CT-substrate (96.5% vs. 55.6% without CT-substrate), with SUVpeak ≥3.5 (91.4% vs. 60.0% with SUVpeak<3.5), in patients with a PSA-level ≥2.0 ng/mL (83.7% vs. 65.7% in patients with PSA <2.0ng/mL) and in patients with >2 PET-positive lesions (94.1% vs. 64.2% in patients with 1-2 PET-positive lesions; p<0.001-0.03).

Conclusions: In this study, the clinical verification of 18F-DCFPyL PET-positive lesions in patients with BCR was performed. Diagnostic certainty of PET-detected lesions increases in the presence of characteristic abnormalities on CT, when SUVpeak is ≥3.5, when PSA-levels exceed 2.0 ng/mL or in patients with more than two PET-positive lesions.

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Background: The aim of this article was to evaluate the usefulness of sequential dual-time-point 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (DTP [18F]FDG PET/CT) in distinguishing physiologic, inflammatory and malignant palatine tonsils as difficult to differentiate in the oncological practice.

Methods: A total of 90 patients before the treatment underwent sequential DTP [18F]FDG PET/CT examinations. We analyzed 104 structures in 90 patients: 31 physiologic tonsils, 28 histopathologically confirmed inflammatory tonsils of non-specified origin, 31 histopathologically confirmed palatine tonsils cancer and 14 non-malignant contralateral tonsils in patients with histopathologically confirmed unilateral palatine tonsil malignancy. Patients underwent sequential [18F]FDG PET/CT examinations at 60 and 90 minutes post-injection of the [18F]FDG. We analyzed the SUVmax and SUVmean values at 60 and 90 minutes post-injection changes over time and the Retention Index (RI-SUVmax). To find the predictive SUV value and the RI cut-off between physiology, inflammatory and malignancy, we used the ROC analysis.

Results: The average SUVmax values at 60 and 90minutes post-injection within physiologic palatine tonsils were 1.36±0.26 and 1.31±0.26, respectively, P>0.05. The average SUVmax values at 60 and 90 minutes post-injection within inflammatory and malignant tonsils were 3.74±1.45, 3.80±1.47 (P>0.05) and 5.19±2.19, 5.81±2.50 (P<0.05), respectively. The RI-SUVmax fluctuation over time were 5±28% within physiologic, -4±11% within contralateral non-malignant tonsils in patients with one tonsil involved, 2±11% within inflammatory and 13±13% within malignant tonsils.

Conclusions: The sequential dual-time-point [18F]FDG PET/CT examinations may increase the sensitivity and the specificity of the PET/CT method in differential palatine tonsils diagnosis.

TITLE: Multi-modality deep learning-based [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-FAPI-04 PET polar map generation: potential value in detecting reactive fibrosis after myocardial infarction

AUTHORS: Xiaoya Qiao, Hanzhong Wang, Hongping Meng, Yun Xi, David Dagan Feng, Biao Li, Xiaoxiang Yan, Min Zhang, Qiu Huang

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Generating polar map (PM) from [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-FAPI-04 PET images is challenging and inaccurate using existing automatic methods that rely on the myocardial anatomical integrity in PET images. This study aims to enhance the accuracy of PM generated from [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-FAPI-04 PET images and explore the potential value of PM in detecting reactive fibrosis after myocardial infarction and assessing its relationship with cardiac function.

Methods: We proposed a deep-learning-based method that fuses multi-modality images to compensate for the cardiac structural information lost in [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-FAPI-04 PET images and accurately generated PMs. We collected 133 pairs of [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-FAPI-04 PET/MR images from 87 ST-segment elevated myocardial infarction patients for training and evaluation purposes. Twenty-six patients were selected for longitudinal analysis, further examining the clinical value of PM-related imaging parameters.

Results: The quantitative comparison demonstrated that our method was comparable with the manual method and surpassed the commercially available software-PMOD in terms of accuracy in generating PMs for [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-FAPI-04 PET images. Clinical analysis revealed the effectiveness of [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-FAPI-04 PET PM in detecting reactive myocardial fibrosis. Significant correlations were demonstrated between the difference of baseline PM FAPI% and PM LGE%, and the change in cardiac function parameters (all p < 0.001), including LVESV% (r = 0.697), LVEDV% (r = 0.621) and LVEF% (r = -0.607).

Conclusion: The [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-FAPI-04 PET PMs generated by our method are comparable to manually generated and sufficient for clinical use. The PMs generated by our method have potential value in detecting reactive fibrosis after myocardial infarction and were associated with cardiac function, suggesting the possibility of enhancing clinical diagnostic practices.

TITLE: Preoperative prediction of regional lymph node metastasis of colorectal cancer based on 18F-FDG PET/CT and machine learning

AUTHORS: Jiahong He, Quanshi Wang, Yin Zhang, Hubing Wu, Yongsheng Zhou, Shuangquan Zhao

JOURNAL: Annals of nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: To establish and validate a regional lymph node (LN) metastasis prediction model of colorectal cancer (CRC) based on18F-FDG PET/CT and radiomic features using machine-learning methods.

Methods: A total of 199 colorectal cancer patients underwent pre-therapy diagnostic18F-FDG PET/CT scans and CRC radical surgery. The Chang-Gung Image Texture Analysis toolbox (CGITA) was used to extract 70 PET radiomic features reflecting18F-FDG uptake heterogeneity of tumors. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm was used to select radiomic features and develop a radiomic signature score (Rad-score). The training set was used to establish five machine-learning prediction models and the test set was used to test the efficacy of the models. The effectiveness of the models was compared by ROC analysis.

Results: The CRC patients were divided into a training set (n = 144) and a test set (n = 55). Two radiomic features were selected to build the Rad-score. Five machine-learning algorithms including logistic regression, support vector machine (SVM), random forest, neural network and eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) were used to established models. Among the five machine-learning models, logistic regression (AUC 0.866, 95% CI 0.808-0.925) and XGBoost (AUC 0.903, 95% CI 0.855-0.951) models performed the best. In the training set, the AUC of these two models were significantly higher than that of the LN metastasis status reported by18F-FDG PET/CT for differentiating positive and negative regional LN metastases in CRC (all p < 0.05). Good efficacy of the above two models was also achieved in the test set. We created a nomogram based on the logistic regression model that visualized the results and provided an easy-to-use method for predicting regional LN metastasis in patients with CRC.

Conclusion: In this study, five machine-learning models for preoperative prediction of regional LN metastasis of CRC based on18F-FDG PET/CT and PET-based radiomic features were successfully developed and validated. Among them, the logistic regression and XGBoost models performed the best, with higher efficacy than18F-FDG PET/CT in both the training and test sets.

TITLE: Need for Objective Task-Based Evaluation of Image Segmentation Algorithms for Quantitative PET: A Study with ACRIN 6668/RTOG 0235 Multicenter Clinical Trial Data

AUTHORS: Ziping Liu, Joyce C Mhlanga, Huitian Xia, Barry A Siegel, Abhinav K Jha

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Reliable performance of PET segmentation algorithms on clinically relevant tasks is required for their clinical translation. However, these algorithms are typically evaluated using figures of merit (FoMs) that are not explicitly designed to correlate with clinical task performance. Such FoMs include the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), the Jaccard similarity coefficient (JSC), and the Hausdorff distance (HD). The objective of this study was to investigate whether evaluating PET segmentation algorithms using these task-agnostic FoMs yields interpretations consistent with evaluation on clinically relevant quantitative tasks.Methods:We conducted a retrospective study to assess the concordance in the evaluation of segmentation algorithms using the DSC, JSC, and HD and on the tasks of estimating the metabolic tumor volume (MTV) and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) of primary tumors from PET images of patients with non-small cell lung cancer. The PET images were collected from the American College of Radiology Imaging Network 6668/Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 0235 multicenter clinical trial data. The study was conducted in 2 contexts: (1) evaluating conventional segmentation algorithms, namely those based on thresholding (SUVmax40% and SUVmax50%), boundary detection (Snakes), and stochastic modeling (Markov random field-Gaussian mixture model); (2) evaluating the impact of network depth and loss function on the performance of a state-of-the-art U-net-based segmentation algorithm.Results:Evaluation of conventional segmentation algorithms based on the DSC, JSC, and HD showed that SUVmax40% significantly outperformed SUVmax50%. However, SUVmax40% yielded lower accuracy on the tasks of estimating MTV and TLG, with a 51% and 54% increase, respectively, in the ensemble normalized bias. Similarly, the Markov random field-Gaussian mixture model significantly outperformed Snakes on the basis of the task-agnostic FoMs but yielded a 24% increased bias in estimated MTV. For the U-net-based algorithm, our evaluation showed that although the network depth did not significantly alter the DSC, JSC, and HD values, a deeper network yielded substantially higher accuracy in the estimated MTV and TLG, with a decreased bias of 91% and 87%, respectively. Additionally, whereas there was no significant difference in the DSC, JSC, and HD values for different loss functions, up to a 73% and 58% difference in the bias of the estimated MTV and TLG, respectively, existed.Conclusion:Evaluation of PET segmentation algorithms using task-agnostic FoMs could yield findings discordant with evaluation on clinically relevant quantitative tasks. This study emphasizes the need for objective task-based evaluation of image segmentation algorithms for quantitative PET.

TITLE: Defining the optimal segmentation method for measuring somatostatin receptor expressing tumor volume on 68 Ga-DOTATATE positron emission tomography/computed tomography to predict prognosis in patients with gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors

AUTHORS: Nuh Filizoglu, Salih Ozguven, Tugba Akin Telli, Tunc Ones, Fuat Dede, Halil T Turoglu, Tanju Y Erdil

JOURNAL: Nuclear medicine communications

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Objective: We aimed to compare different segmentation methods used to calculate prognostically valuable volumetric parameters, somatostatin receptor expressing tumor volume (SRETV), and total lesion somatostatin receptor expression (TLSRE), measured by 68 Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT and to find the optimal segmentation method to predict prognosis.

Patients and methods: Images of 34 patients diagnosed with gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (GEPNET) who underwent 68 Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT imaging were reanalyzed. Four different threshold-based methods (fixed relative threshold method, normal liver background threshold method, fixed absolute standardized uptake value (SUV) threshold method, and adaptive threshold method) were used to calculate SRETV and TLSRE values. SRETV of all lesions of a patient was summarized as whole body SRETV (WB-SRETV) and TLSRE of all lesions of a patient was computed as whole body TLSRE (WB-TLSRE).

Results: WB-SRETVs calculated with all segmentation methods were statistically significantly associated with progression-free survival except WB-SRETV at which was calculated using adaptive threshold method. The fixed relative threshold methods calculated by using 45% (WB-SRETV 45% ) and 60% (WB-SRETV 60% ) of the SUV value as threshold respectively, were found to have statistically significant highest prognostic value (C-index = 0.704, CI = 0.622-0.786, P = 0.007). Among WB-TLSRE parameters, WB-TLSRE 35% , WB-TLSRE 40% , and WB-TLSRE 50% had the highest prognostic value (C-index = 0.689, CI = 0.604-0.774, P = 0.008).

Conclusion: The fixed relative threshold method was found to be the most effective and easily applicable method to measure SRETV on pretreatment 68 Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT to predict prognosis in GEPNET patients. WB-SRETV 45% (cutoff value of 11.8 cm 3 ) and WB-SRETV 60% (cutoff value of 6.3 cm 3 ) were found to be the strongest predictors of prognosis in GEPNET patients.

TITLE: Machine learning-based analysis of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT images for estimation of prostate tumor grade

AUTHORS: Maziar Khateri, Farshid Babapour Mofrad, Parham Geramifar, Elnaz Jenabi

JOURNAL: Physical and engineering sciences in medicine

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Early diagnosis of prostate cancer, the most common malignancy in men, can improve patient outcomes. Since the tissue sampling procedures are invasive and sometimes inconclusive, an alternative image-based method can prevent possible complications and facilitate treatment management. We aim to propose a machine-learning model for tumor grade estimation based on68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT images in prostate cancer patients. This study included 90 eligible participants out of 244 biopsy-proven prostate cancer patients who underwent staging68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT imaging. The patients were divided into high and low-intermediate groups based on their Gleason scores. The PET-only images were manually segmented, both lesion-based and whole prostate, by two experienced nuclear medicine physicians. Four feature selection algorithms and five classifiers were applied to Combat-harmonized and non-harmonized datasets. To evaluate the model's generalizability across different institutions, we performed leave-one-center-out cross-validation (LOOCV). The metrics derived from the receiver operating characteristic curve were used to assess model performance. In the whole prostate segmentation, combining the ANOVA algorithm as the feature selector with Random Forest (RF) and Extra Trees (ET) classifiers resulted in the highest performance among the models, with an AUC of 0.78 and 083, respectively. In the lesion-based segmentation, the highest AUC was achieved by MRMR feature selector + Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Logistic Regression (LR) classifiers (0.76 and 0.79, respectively). The LOOCV results revealed that both the RF_ANOVA and ET_ANOVA models showed high levels of accuracy and generalizability across different centers, with an average AUC value of 0.87 for the ET_ANOVA combination. Machine learning-based analysis of radiomics features extracted from68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT scans can accurately classify prostate tumors into low-risk and intermediate- to high-risk groups.

TITLE: PET/computed tomography radiomics combined with clinical features in predicting sarcopenia and prognosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma

AUTHORS: Fanghu Wang, Yang Chen, Xiaoyue Tan, Xu Han, Wantong Lu, Lijun Lu, Hui Yuan, Lei Jiang

JOURNAL: Nuclear medicine communications

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Background: The study aimed to assess the role of 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/computed tomography (CT) radiomics combined with clinical features using machine learning (ML) in predicting sarcopenia and prognosis of patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).

Methods: A total of 178 DLBCL patients (118 and 60 applied for training and test sets, respectively) who underwent pretreatment 18 F-FDG PET/CT were retrospectively enrolled. Clinical characteristics and PET/CT radiomics features were analyzed, and feature selection was performed using univariate logistic regression and correlation analysis. Sarcopenia prediction models were built by ML algorithms and evaluated. Besides, prognostic models were also developed, and their associations with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were identified.

Results: Fourteen features were finally selected to build sarcopenia prediction and prognosis models, including two clinical (maximum standard uptake value of muscle and BMI), nine PET (seven gray-level and two first-order), and three CT (three gray-level) radiomics features. Among sarcopenia prediction models, combined clinical-PET/CT radiomics features models outperformed other models; especially the support vector machine algorithm achieved the highest area under curve of 0.862, with the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 79.2, 83.3, and 78.3% in the test set. Furthermore, the consistency index based on the prognostic models was 0.753 and 0.807 for PFS and OS, respectively. The enrolled patients were subsequently divided into high-risk and low-risk groups with significant differences, regardless of PFS or OS ( P < 0.05).

Conclusion: ML models incorporating clinical and PET/CT radiomics features could effectively predict the presence of sarcopenia and assess the prognosis in patients with DLBCL.

TITLE: Late Radiation-Related Toxicities in Patients Treated for Early-Stage Cervical Carcinoma by Surgery and Adjuvant Radiotherapy: A Retrospective Imaging Study

AUTHORS: Katarina Nadova, Miroslava Burghardtova, Klara Fejfarova, Klaudia Reginacova, Hana Malikova

JOURNAL: Pathology oncology research : POR

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Surgical treatment is preferred therapy of early-stage cervical carcinoma. In the risk of cancer recurrence surgery is often followed by adjuvant radiotherapy. In our retrospective study we aimed at identifying late (≥6 months) and very late (≥5 years) radiation adverse effects on imaging scans as CT, PET/CT and MRI in patients who underwent successful treatment for cervical carcinoma by radical surgery combined with radiotherapy ± chemotherapy. We correlated imaging results with clinical manifestations. We selected young and middle-aged patients with long life expectancy, as late radiation-related toxicities may significantly affect their quality of life. Patients were selected from those who were primary diagnosed and treated between the years 1987-2011 and regularly visited our Oncology department in years 2011-2012. Following inclusion criteria were applied: age ≤55 years at diagnosis, clinical follow-up ≥5 years and at least one tomography scan ≥3 years after finished treatment. One hundred and three subjects were reviewed: 73 patients met all inclusion criteria, while 30 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria except for available tomography scan ≥3 years after therapy. The mean imaging follow-up was 11.2 ± 7.6 years and the mean clinical follow-up was 15.0 ± 6.9 years. In 20 (27%) subjects 27 cases grade I radiation-related toxicities were found; 9 (33%) of those 27 cases were clinically silent. In 14 (19%) females only grade I toxicities were observed. Grade III-IV toxicities were found in 5 (6.8%) subjects. No grade V toxicities were observed. We concluded that severe late side effects caused by radiotherapy were exceedingly rare in females successfully treated for early-stage cervical carcinoma, only 1 bilateral osteonecrosis, 2 cases of ileus, and 2 potentially radiation-induced tumors were found. The majority of radiation-related comorbidities found on imaging scans were clinically silent.

JOURNAL: Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Hallucinogens are a loosely defined group of compounds including LSD,N,N-dimethyltryptamines, mescaline, psilocybin/psilocin, and 2,5-dimethoxy-4-methamphetamine (DOM), which can evoke intense visual and emotional experiences. We are witnessing a renaissance of research interest in hallucinogens, driven by increasing awareness of their psychotherapeutic potential. As such, we now present a narrative review of the literature on hallucinogen binding in vitro and ex vivo, and the various molecular imaging studies with positron emission tomography (PET) or single photon emission computer tomography (SPECT). In general, molecular imaging can depict the uptake and binding distribution of labelled hallucinogenic compounds or their congeners in the brain, as was shown in an early PET study withN1-([11C]-methyl)-2-bromo-LSD ([11C]-MBL); displacement with the non-radioactive competitor ketanserin confirmed that the majority of [11C]-MBL specific binding was to serotonin 5-HT2Areceptors. However, interactions at serotonin 5HT1Aand other classes of receptors and pleotropic effects on second messenger pathways may contribute to the particular experiential phenomenologies of LSD and other hallucinogenic compounds. Other salient aspects of hallucinogen action include permeability to the blood-brain barrier, the rates of metabolism and elimination, and the formation of active metabolites. Despite the maturation of radiochemistry and molecular imaging in recent years, there has been only a handful of PET or SPECT studies of radiolabeled hallucinogens, most recently using the 5-HT2A/2CagonistN-(2[11CH3O]-methoxybenzyl)-2,5-dimethoxy- 4-bromophenethylamine ([11C]Cimbi-36). In addition to PET studies of target engagement at neuroreceptors and transporters, there is a small number of studies on the effects of hallucinogenic compounds on cerebral perfusion ([15O]-water) or metabolism ([18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose/FDG). There remains considerable scope for basic imaging research on the sites of interaction of hallucinogens and their cerebrometabolic effects; we expect that hybrid imaging with PET in conjunction with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) should provide especially useful for the next phase of this research.

ABSTRACT:
The newly developed core imaging library (CIL) is a flexible plug and play library for tomographic imaging with a specific focus on iterative reconstruction. CIL provides building blocks for tailored regularized reconstruction algorithms and explicitly supports multichannel tomographic data. In the first part of this two-part publication, we introduced the fundamentals of CIL. This paper focuses on applications of CIL for multichannel data, e.g. dynamic and spectral. We formalize different optimization problems for colour processing, dynamic and hyperspectral tomography and demonstrate CIL's capabilities for designing state-of-the-art reconstruction methods through case studies and code snapshots. This article is part of the theme issue 'Synergistic tomographic image reconstruction: part 2'.

TITLE: Analytical performance of aPROMISE: automated anatomic contextualization, detection, and quantification of [18F]DCFPyL (PSMA) imaging for standardized reporting

AUTHORS: Kerstin Johnsson, Johan Brynolfsson, Hannicka Sahlstedt, Nicholas G Nickols, Matthew Rettig, Stephan Probst, Michael J Morris, Anders Bjartell, Mathias Eiber, Aseem Anand

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: The application of automated image analyses could improve and facilitate standardization and consistency of quantification in [18F]DCFPyL (PSMA) PET/CT scans. In the current study, we analytically validated aPROMISE, a software as a medical device that segments organs in low-dose CT images with deep learning, and subsequently detects and quantifies potential pathological lesions in PSMA PET/CT.

Methods: To evaluate the deep learning algorithm, the automated segmentations of the low-dose CT component of PSMA PET/CT scans from 20 patients were compared to manual segmentations. Dice scores were used to quantify the similarities between the automated and manual segmentations. Next, the automated quantification of tracer uptake in the reference organs and detection and pre-segmentation of potential lesions were evaluated in 339 patients with prostate cancer, who were all enrolled in the phase II/III OSPREY study. Three nuclear medicine physicians performed the retrospective independent reads of OSPREY images with aPROMISE. Quantitative consistency was assessed by the pairwise Pearson correlations and standard deviation between the readers and aPROMISE. The sensitivity of detection and pre-segmentation of potential lesions was evaluated by determining the percent of manually selected abnormal lesions that were automatically detected by aPROMISE.

Results: The Dice scores for bone segmentations ranged from 0.88 to 0.95. The Dice scores of the PSMA PET/CT reference organs, thoracic aorta and liver, were 0.89 and 0.97, respectively. Dice scores of other visceral organs, including prostate, were observed to be above 0.79. The Pearson correlation for blood pool reference was higher between any manual reader and aPROMISE, than between any pair of manual readers. The standard deviations of reference organ uptake across all patients as determined by aPROMISE (SD = 0.21 blood pool and SD = 1.16 liver) were lower compared to those of the manual readers. Finally, the sensitivity of aPROMISE detection and pre-segmentation was 91.5% for regional lymph nodes, 90.6% for all lymph nodes, and 86.7% for bone in metastatic patients.

Conclusion: In this analytical study, we demonstrated the segmentation accuracy of the deep learning algorithm, the consistency in quantitative assessment across multiple readers, and the high sensitivity in detecting potential lesions. The study provides a foundational framework for clinical evaluation of aPROMISE in standardized reporting of PSMA PET/CT.

TITLE: Radiomics model based on preoperative 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET predicts N2-3b lymph node metastasis in gastric cancer patients

AUTHORS: Xiu-Qing Xue, Wen-Ji Yu, Xiao-Liang Shao, Xiao-Feng Li, Rong Niu, Fei-Fei Zhang, Yun-Mei Shi, Yue-Tao Wang

JOURNAL: Nuclear medicine communications

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Objective: The aim of the study was to construct and validate 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) PET-based radiomics nomogram and use it to predict N2-3b lymph node metastasis in Chinese patients with gastric cancer (GC).

Methods: A total of 127 patients with pathologically confirmed GC who underwent preoperative 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging between January 2014 and September 2020 were enrolled as subjects in this study. We use the LIFEx software to extract PET radiomic features. A radiomics signature (Rad-score) was developed with the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator algorithm. Then a prediction model, which incorporated the Rad-score and independent clinical risk factors, was constructed and presented with a radiomics nomogram. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to assess the performance of Rad-score and the nomogram. Finally, decision curve analysis (DCA) was applied to evaluate the clinical usefulness of the nomogram.

Results: The PET Rad-score, which includes four selected features, was significantly related to pN2-3b (all P < 0.05). The prediction model, which comprised the Rad-score and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level, showed good calibration and discrimination [area under the ROC curve: 0.81(95% confidence interval: 0.74-0.89), P < 0.001)]. The DCA also indicated that the prediction model was clinically useful.

Conclusion: This study presents a radiomics nomogram consisting of a radiomics signature based on PET images and CEA level that can be conveniently used for personalized prediction of high-risk N2-3b metastasis in Chinese GC patients.

TITLE: High Interobserver Agreement for the Standardized Reporting System SSTR-RADS 1.0 on Somatostatin Receptor PET/CT

AUTHORS: Rudolf A Werner, Thorsten Derlin, Steven P Rowe, Lena Bundschuh, Gabriel T Sheikh, Martin G Pomper, Sebastian Schulz, Takahiro Higuchi, Andreas K Buck, Frank M Bengel, Ralph A Bundschuh, Constantin Lapa

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Recently, a standardized framework system for interpreting somatostatin receptor (SSTR)-targeted PET/CT, termed the SSTR reporting and data system (RADS) 1.0, was introduced, providing reliable standards and criteria for SSTR-targeted imaging. We determined the interobserver reliability of SSTR-RADS for interpretation of68Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT scans in a multicentric, randomized setting.Methods:A set of 51 randomized68Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT scans was independently assessed by 4 masked readers with different levels of experience (2 experienced readers and 2 inexperienced readers) trained on the SSTR-RADS 1.0 criteria (based on a 5-point scale from 1 [definitively benign] to 5 [high certainty that neuroendocrine neoplasia is present]). For each scan, SSTR-RADS scores were assigned to a maximum of 5 target lesions (TLs). An overall scan impression based on SSTR-RADS was indicated, and interobserver agreement rates on a TL-based, on an organ-based, and on an overall SSTR-RADS score-based level were computed. The readers were also asked to decide whether peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) should be considered on the basis of the assigned RADS scores.Results:Among the selected TLs, 153 were chosen by at least 2 readers (all 4 readers selected the same TLs in 58 of 153 [37.9%] instances). The interobserver agreement for SSTR-RADS scoring among identical TLs was good (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] ≥ 0.73 for 4, 3, and 2 identical TLs). For lymph node and liver lesions, excellent interobserver agreement rates were derived (ICC, 0.91 and 0.77, respectively). Moreover, the interobserver agreement for an overall scan impression based on SSTR-RADS was excellent (ICC, 0.88). The SSTR-RADS-based decision to use PRRT also demonstrated excellent agreement, with an ICC of 0.80. No significant differences between experienced and inexperienced readers for an overall scan impression and TL-based SSTR-RADS scoring were observed (P≥ 0.18), thereby suggesting that SSTR-RADS seems to be readily applicable even for less experienced readers.Conclusion:SSTR-RADS-guided assessment demonstrated a high concordance rate, even among readers with different levels of experience, supporting the adoption of SSTR-RADS for trials, clinical routine, or outcome studies.

TITLE: Impact of different parametric Patlak imaging approaches and comparison with a 2-tissue compartment pharmacokinetic model with a long axial field-of-view (LAFOV) PET/CT in oncological patients

AUTHORS: Leyun Pan, Christos Sachpekidis, Jessica Hassel, Petros Christopoulos, Antonia Dimitrakopoulou-Strauss

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Aim: The recently introduced Long-Axial-Field-of-View (LAFOV) PET-CT scanners allow for the first-time whole-body dynamic- and parametric imaging. Primary aim of this study was the comparison of direct and indirect Patlak imaging as well as the comparison of different time frames for Patlak calculation with the LAFOV PET-CT in oncological patients. Secondary aims of the study were lesion detectability and comparison of Patlak analysis with a two-tissue-compartment model (2TCM).

Methodology: 50 oncological patients with 346 tumor lesions were enrolled in the study. All patients underwent [18F]FDG PET/CT (skull to upper thigh). Here, the Image-Derived-Input-Function) (IDIF) from the descending aorta was used as the exclusive input function. Four sets of images have been reviewed visually and evaluated quantitatively using the target-to-background (TBR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR): short-time (30 min)-direct (STD) Patlak Ki, short-time (30 min)-indirect (STI) Patlak Ki, long-time (59.25 min)-indirect (LTI) Patlak Ki, and 50-60 min SUV (sumSUV). VOI-based 2TCM was used for the evaluation of tumor lesions and normal tissues and compared with the results of Patlak model.

Results: No significant differences were observed between the four approaches regarding the number of tumor lesions. However, we found three discordant results: a true positive liver lesion in all Patlak Kiimages, a false positive liver lesion delineated only in LTI Kiwhich was a hemangioma according to MRI and a true negative example in a patient with an atelectasis next to a lung tumor. STD, STI and LTI Kiimages had superior TBR in comparison with sumSUV images (2.9-, 3.3- and 4.3-fold higher respectively). TBR of LTI Kiwere significantly higher than STD Ki. VOI-based k3showed a 21-fold higher TBR than sumSUV. Parameters of different models vary in their differential capability between tumor lesions and normal tissue like Patlak Kiwhich was better in normal lung and 2TCM k3which was better in normal liver. 2TCM Kirevealed the highest correlation (r = 0.95) with the LTI Patlak Kiin tumor lesions group and demonstrated the highest correlation with the STD Patlak Kiin all tissues group and normal tissues group (r = 0.93 and r = 0.74 respectively).

Conclusions: Dynamic [18F]-FDG with the new LAFOV PET/CT scanner produces Patlak Kiimages with better lesion contrast than SUV images, but does not increase the lesion detection rate. The time window used for Patlak imaging plays a more important role than the direct or indirect method. A combination of different models, like Patlak and 2TCM may be helpful in parametric imaging to obtain the best TBR in the whole body in future.

TITLE: Clinical impact of 68Ga-DOTATATE PET-CT imaging in patients with medullary thyroid cancer

AUTHORS: Murat Tuncel, Saadettin Kılıçkap, Nilda Süslü

JOURNAL: Annals of nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) arises from neuroendocrine C cells of the thyroid. There is no single diagnostic imaging method that can reveal all MTC recurrences or metastases.68Ga-DOTATATE is an alternative PET radiotracer that showed acceptable efficacy in the detection of MTC. In this study, we aimed to reveal the clinical efficacy and impact of this radiotracer on the management of patients with MTC.

Methods: The68Ga-DOTATATE PET-CT records of 38 patients with confirmed MTC were included in the study. The demographic data, clinical indication for the scan, previous therapies, and tumor marker levels were recorded. The site and SUVmax of the lesions were also noted. A consensus was reached on the additional value of68Ga-DOTATATE PET-CT, and sites with discordant results on conventional imaging (CI). Finally, changes in management after the scan were evaluated.

Results: 68Ga-DOTATATE PET-CT outperformed CI in 14/38 (37%) patients. In these 14 patients, metastatic lymph nodes were detected in 8, bone metastases in 4, and both bone and lymph nodes metastases in 2 patients. In 16/38 (42%) patients,68Ga-DOTATATE PET-CT performed equally well as CI. In 5/38 (13%) patients, CI outperformed PET-CT. Most of the patients (4/5) in this group had hepatic metastases.68Ga-DOTATATE PET-CT positivity was also correlated with tumor marker expression [median calcitonin; PET-positive: 743 ± 5439 vs PET-negative: 45 ± 17 (p:0.012), median CEA; PET-positive: 41 ± 162 vs PET-negative: 2.6 ± 1.4 (p:0.015)].68Ga-DOTATATE PET-CT changed the clinical management of 13/38 (34%) patients. The information provided by PET-CT resulted in neck surgery in 5/13 patients, external radiotherapy in 3/13 and both in one patient. Four of these thirteen patients were found to be eligible for peptide receptor radionuclide therapy.

Conclusion: 68Ga-DOTATATE is an essential part of the work-up for patients with MTC. This modality outperformed CI in 14/38 (37%) patients and changed the clinical management in 13/38 (34%) patients. Prospective randomized studies with image-guided therapy decisions are needed to further reveal the impact of PET imaging in patients with MTC.

TITLE: Prognostic value of 18F-FDG PET/CT with texture analysis in patients with rectal cancer treated by surgery

AUTHORS: Masatoshi Hotta, Ryogo Minamimoto, Yoshimasa Gohda, Kenta Miwa, Kensuke Otani, Tomomichi Kiyomatsu, Hideaki Yano

JOURNAL: Annals of nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of texture analysis using pretreatment18F-FDG PET/CT to predict prognosis in patients with surgically treated rectal cancer.

Methods: We analyzed 94 patients with pathologically proven rectal cancer who underwent pretreatment18F-FDG PET/CT and were subsequently treated with surgery. The volume of interest of the primary tumor was defined using a threshold of 40% of the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax), and conventional (SUVmax, metabolic tumor volume [MTV], total lesion glycolysis [TLG]) and textural PET features were extracted. Harmonization of PET features was performed with the ComBat method. The study endpoints were overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS), and the prognostic value of PET features was evaluated by Cox regression analysis.

Results: In the follow-up period (median 41.7 [interquartile range, 30.5-60.4] months), 21 (22.3%) and 30 (31.9%) patients had cancer-related death or disease progression, respectively. Univariate analysis revealed a significant association of (1) MTV, TLG, and gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) entropy with OS; and (2) SUVmax, MTV, TLG, and GLCM entropy with PFS. In multivariate analysis including clinical characteristics, GLCM entropy (≥ 2.13) was the only relevant prognostic PET feature for poor OS (hazard ratio [HR]: 4.16, p = 0.035) and PFS (HR: 2.70, p = 0.046).

Conclusion: GLCM entropy, which indicates metabolic intratumoral heterogeneity, was an independent prognostic factor in patients with surgically treated rectal cancer. Compared with conventional PET features, GLCM entropy has better predictive value and shows potential to facilitate precision medicine.

TITLE: Prediction of local recurrence and distant metastasis using radiomics analysis of pretreatment nasopharyngeal [18F]FDG PET/CT images

AUTHORS: Lihong Peng, Xiaotong Hong, Qingyu Yuan, Lijun Lu, Quanshi Wang, Wufan Chen

JOURNAL: Annals of nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Objectives: To develop a radiomics signature to predict locoregional recurrence (LR) and distant metastasis (DM), as extracted from pretreatment 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose ([18F]FDG) positron emission tomography/X-ray computed tomography (PET/CT) images in locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).

Materials and methods: Eighty-five patients with Stage III-IVB NPC underwent pretreatment [18F]FDG PET/CT scans and received radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy. 53 of them achieved disease control, and 32 of them failed after treatment (15: LR, 17: DM). A total of 114 radiomic features were extracted from PET/CT images. For univariate analysis, Wilcoxon test and Chi-square test were used to compare median values of features between different treatment outcomes and predict the risk of treatment failure, respectively. For multivariate analysis, all features were grouped into clusters based on Pearson correlation using hierarchical clustering, and the representative feature of each cluster was chosen by the Relief algorithm. Then sequential floating forward selection (SFFS) coupled with a support vector machine (SVM) classifier were used to derive the optimized feature set in terms of the area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). The performance of the model was evaluated by leave-one-out-cross-validation, fivefold cross-validation, tenfold cross-validation.

Results: Twenty features had significant differences between disease control and treatment failure. NPC patients with values of Compactness1, Compactness2, Coarseness_NGTDM or SGE_GLGLM above the median as well as patients with values of Irregularity, RLN_GLRLM or GLV_GLSZM below the median, showed a significant (p < 0.05) higher risk of treatment failure (about 50% vs. 25%). The derived radiomics signature consisted of 5 features with the highest AUC value of 0.8290 (sensitivity: 0.8438, specificity: 0.7736) using leave-one-out-cross-validation.

Conclusion: Locoregional recurrence (LR) and DM of locally advanced NPC can be predicted using radiomics analysis of pretreatment [18F]FDG PET/CT. The SFFS feature selection coupled with SVM classifier can derive the optimized feature set with correspondingly highest AUC value for pretreatment prediction of LR and/or DM of NPC.

TITLE: Spectral guided sparse inverse covariance estimation of metabolic networks in Parkinson's disease

AUTHORS: Phoebe G Spetsieris, David Eidelberg

JOURNAL: NeuroImage

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
In neurodegenerative disorders, a clearer understanding of the underlying aberrant networks facilitates the search for effective therapeutic targets and potential cures. [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging data of brain metabolism reflects the distribution of glucose consumption known to be directly related to neural activity. In FDG PET resting-state metabolic data, characteristic disease-related patterns have been identified in group analysis of various neurodegenerative conditions using principal component analysis of multivariate spatial covariance. Notably, among several parkinsonian syndromes, the identified Parkinson's disease-related pattern (PDRP) has been repeatedly validated as an imaging biomarker of PD in independent groups worldwide. Although the primary nodal associations of this network are known, its connectivity is not fully understood. Here, we describe a novel approach to elucidate functional principal component (PC) network connections by performing graph theoretical sparse network derivation directly within the disease relevant PC partition layer of the whole brain data rather than by searching for associations retrospectively in whole brain sparse representations. Using sparse inverse covariance estimation of each overlapping PC partition layer separately, a single coherent network is detected for each layer in contrast to more spatially modular segmentation in whole brain data analysis. Using this approach, the major nodal hubs of the PD disease network are identified and their characteristic functional pathways are clearly distinguished within the basal ganglia, midbrain and parietal areas. Network associations are further clarified using Laplacian spectral analysis of the adjacency matrices. In addition, the innate discriminative capacity of the eigenvector centrality of the graph derived networks in differentiating PD versus healthy external data provides evidence of their validity.

TITLE: A robust method for the detection of small changes in relaxation parameters and free water content in the vicinity of the substantia nigra in Parkinson's disease patients

AUTHORS: Krzysztof Dzieciol, Elene Iordanishvili, Zaheer Abbas, Adjmal Nahimi, Michael Winterdahl, N Jon Shah

JOURNAL: PloS one

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Alterations in the substantia nigra are strongly associated with Parkinson's disease. However, due to low contrast and partial volume effects present in typical MRI images, the substantia nigra is not of sufficient size to obtain a reliable segmentation for region-of-interest based analysis. To combat this problem, the approach proposed here offers a method to investigate and reveal changes in quantitative MRI parameters in the vicinity of substantia nigra without any a priori delineation. This approach uses an alternative method of statistical, voxel-based analysis of quantitative maps and was tested on 18 patients and 15 healthy controls using a well-established, quantitative free water mapping protocol. It was possible to reveal the topology and the location of pathological changes in the substantia nigra and its vicinity. Moreover, a decrease in free water content, T1 and T2* in the vicinity of substantia nigra was indicated in the Parkinson's disease patients compared to the healthy controls. These findings reflect a disruption of grey matter and iron accumulation, which is known to lead to neurodegeneration. Consequently, the proposed method demonstrates an increased sensitivity for the detection of pathological changes-even in small regions-and can facilitate disease monitoring via quantitative MR parameters.

Functional MRI (fMRI) studies have reported altered integrity of large-scale neurocognitive networks (NCNs) in dementing disorders. However, findings on the specificity of these alterations in patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) and behavioral-variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) are still limited. Recently, NCNs have been successfully captured using PET with18F-FDG.Methods:Network integrity was measured in 72 individuals (38 male) with mild AD or bvFTD, and in healthy controls, using a simultaneous resting-state fMRI and18F-FDG PET. Indices of network integrity were calculated for each subject, network, and imaging modality.Results:In either modality, independent-component analysis revealed 4 major NCNs: anterior default-mode network (DMN), posterior DMN, salience network, and right central executive network (CEN). In fMRI data, the integrity of the posterior DMN was found to be significantly reduced in both patient groups relative to controls. In the AD group the anterior DMN and CEN appeared to be additionally affected. In PET data, only the integrity of the posterior DMN in patients with AD was reduced, whereas 3 remaining networks appeared to be affected only in patients with bvFTD. In a logistic regression analysis, the integrity of the anterior DMN as measured with PET alone accurately differentiated between the patient groups. A correlation between indices of 2 imaging modalities was low overall.Conclusion:FMRI and18F-FDG PET capture partly different aspects of network integrity. A higher disease specificity for NCNs as derived from PET data supports metabolic connectivity imaging as a promising diagnostic tool.

TITLE: Towards the use of multiple ROIs for radiomics-based survival modelling: Finding a strategy of aggregating lesions

AUTHORS: Agata Małgorzata Wilk, Andrzej Swierniak, Andrea d'Amico, Rafał Suwiński, Krzysztof Fujarewicz, Damian Borys

JOURNAL: Computer methods and programs in biomedicine

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Background: Radiomic features, derived from a region of interest (ROI) in medical images, are valuable as prognostic factors. Selecting an appropriate ROI is critical, and many recent studies have focused on leveraging multiple ROIs by segmenting analogous regions across patients - such as the primary tumour and peritumoral area or subregions of the tumour. These can be straightforwardly incorporated into models as additional features. However, a more complex scenario arises, for example, in a regionally disseminated disease, when multiple distinct lesions are present.

Aim: This study aims to evaluate the feasibility of integrating radiomic data from multiple lesions into survival models. We explore strategies for incorporating these ROIs and hypothesize that including all available lesions can improve model performance.

Methods: While each lesion produces a feature vector, the desired result is a unified prediction. We propose methods to aggregate either the feature vectors to form a representative one or the modelling results to compute a consolidated risk score. As a proof of concept, we apply these strategies to predict distant metastasis risk in a cohort of 115 non-small cell lung cancer patients, 60% of whom exhibit regionally advanced disease. Two feature sets (radiomics extracted from PET and PET interpolated to CT resolution) are tested across various survival models using a Monte Carlo Cross-Validation framework.

Results: Across both feature sets, incorporating all available lesions - rather than limiting analysis to the primary tumour - consistently improved the c-index, irrespective of the survival model used. The highest c-Index obtained by a primary tumour-only model was 0.611 for the PET dataset and 0.614 for the PET_CT dataset, while by using all lesions we were able to achieve c-Indices of 0.632 and 0.634.

Conclusion: Lesions beyond the primary tumour carry information that should be utilized in radiomics-based models to enhance predictive ability.

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Alzheimer disease (AD) exhibits spatially heterogeneous 3- or 4-repeat tau deposition across participants. Our overall goal was to develop an automated method to quantify the heterogeneous burden of tau deposition into a single number that would be clinically useful.Methods:We used tau PET scans from 3 independent cohorts: the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging and Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (Mayo,n= 1,290), the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI,n= 831), and the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS-3,n= 430). A machine learning binary classification model was trained on Mayo data and validated on ADNI and OASIS-3 with the goal of predicting visual tau positivity (as determined by 3 raters following Food and Drug Administration criteria for18F-flortaucipir). The machine learning model used region-specific SUV ratios scaled to cerebellar crus uptake. We estimated feature contributions based on an artificial intelligence-explainable method (Shapley additive explanations) and formulated a global tau summary measure, Tau Heterogeneity Evaluation in Alzheimer's Disease (THETA) score, using SUV ratios and Shapley additive explanations for each participant. We compared the performance of THETA with that of commonly used meta-regions of interest (ROIs) using the Mini-Mental State Examination, the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes, clinical diagnosis, and histopathologic staging.Results:The model achieved a balanced accuracy of 95% on the Mayo test set and at least 87% on the validation sets. It classified tau-positive and -negative participants with an AUC of 1.00, 0.96, and 0.94 on the Mayo, ADNI, and OASIS-3 cohorts, respectively. Across all cohorts, THETA showed a better correlation with the Mini-Mental State Examination and the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (ρ ≥ 0.45,P< 0.05) than did meta-ROIs (ρ < 0.44,P< 0.05) and discriminated between participants who were cognitively unimpaired and those who had mild cognitive impairment with an effect size of 10.09, compared with an effect size of 3.08 for meta-ROIs.Conclusion:Our proposed approach identifies positive tau PET scans and provides a quantitative summary measure, THETA, that effectively captures heterogeneous tau deposition observed in AD. The application of THETA for quantifying tau PET in AD exhibits great potential.

TITLE: Semiautomatic Tumor Delineation for Evaluation of 64Cu-DOTATATE PET/CT in Patients with Neuroendocrine Neoplasms: Prognostication Based on Lowest Lesion Uptake and Total Tumor Volume

AUTHORS: Esben Andreas Carlsen, Camilla Bardram Johnbeck, Mathias Loft, Andreas Pfeifer, Peter Oturai, Seppo W Langer, Ulrich Knigge, Claes Nøhr Ladefoged, Andreas Kjaer

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Patients with neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) have heterogeneous somatostatin receptor expression, with highly differentiated lesions having higher expression. Receptor expression of the total tumor burden may be visualized by somatostatin receptor imaging, such as with64Cu-DOTATATE PET/CT. Assessment of maximal lesion uptake is associated with progression-free survival (PFS) but not overall survival (OS). We hypothesized that the lesion with the lowest, rather than the highest,64Cu-DOTATATE uptake would be more prognostic, and we developed a semiautomatic method for evaluating this hypothesis.Methods:Patients with NENs underwent64Cu-DOTATATE PET/CT. A standardized semiautomatic tumor delineation method was developed and used to identify the lesion with the lowest uptake, that is, with the lowest SUVmeanAdditionally, we assessed total tumor volume derived from the semiautomatic tumor delineation. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses were used to determine whether there was any association with OS and PFS.Results:In 116 patients with NENs, median PFS (95% CI) was 23 mo (range, 20-31 mo) and median OS was 85 mo (range, 68-113 mo). Minimum SUVmeanand total tumor volume were significantly associated with PFS and OS in univariate Cox regression analyses, whereas SUVmaxwas significant only for PFS. In multivariate Cox analyses, both minimum SUVmeanand total tumor volume remained statistically significant. Minimum SUVmeanand total tumor volume were then dichotomized by their median, and patients were categorized into 4 groups: high or low total tumor volume and high or low minimum SUVmeanPatients with a low total tumor volume and high minimum SUVmeanhad a hazard ratio of 0.32 (95% CI, 0.20-0.51) for PFS and 0.24 (95% CI, 0.13-0.43) for OS, both withPvalues of less than 0.001 (reference: high total tumor volume and low minimum SUVmean).Conclusion:We propose a standardized semiautomatic tumor delineation method to identify the lesion with the lowest64Cu-DOTATATE uptake and total tumor volume. Assessment of the lowest, rather than the highest, lesion uptake greatly increases prognostication by64Cu-DOTATATE PET/CT. Combining lesion uptake and total tumor volume, we derived a novel prognostic classification system for patients with NENs.

TITLE: Left ventricle function assessment using gated first-pass 18F-FDG PET: Validation against equilibrium radionuclide angiography

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear cardiology : official publication of the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: We appraised the feasibility of left ventricle (LV) function assessment using gated first-pass18F-FDG PET, and assessed the concordance of the produced measurements with equilibrium radionuclide angiography (ERNA).

Materials and methods: Twenty-four oncologic patients benefited from99mTc-labeled red-blood-cell ERNA, in planar mode (all patients) and using SPECT (22 patients). All patients underwent gated first-pass18F-FDG cardiac PET. Gated dynamic PET images were reconstructed over 1 minute during tracer first-pass inside the LV and post-processed using in-house software (TomPool). After re-orientation into cardiac canonical axes and adjustment of the valves plane using a phase image, pseudo-planar PET images obtained by re-projection were automatically segmented using thresholded region growing and gradient-based delineation to produce an LV ejection fraction (EF) estimate. PET images were also post-processed in fully-tomographic mode to produce LV end diastole volume (EDV), end systole volume (ESV), and EF estimates. Concordance was assessed using Lin's concordance (ccc) and Bland-Altman analysis. Reproducibility was assessed using the coefficient of variation (CoV) and intra-class correlation (ICC).

Results: Pseudo-planar PET EF estimates were concordant with planar ERNA (ccc = 0.81, P < .001) with a bias of 0% (95% CI [- 2%; 3%], limits of agreement [- 11%; 12%]). Reproducibility was excellent and similar for both methods (CoV = 2 ± 1% and 3 ± 2%, P = NS; ICC = 0.97 and 0.92, for PET and ERNA, respectively). Measurements obtained in fully-tomographic mode were concordant with SPECT ERNA: ccc = 0.83 and bias = - 3 mL for LV EDV, ccc = 0.92 and bias = 0 mL for LV ESV, ccc = 0.89 and bias = - 1% for LV EF (all P values < .001 for ccc, all biases not significant).

Conclusions: Gated first-pass18F-FDG PET might stand as a relevant alternative to ERNA for LV function assessment, enabling a joint evaluation of both therapeutic response and cardiac toxicity in oncologic patients receiving cardiotoxic chemotherapy.

TITLE: In vivo synaptic density relates to glucose metabolism at rest in healthy subjects, but is strongly modulated by regional differences

AUTHORS: June van Aalst, Jenny Ceccarini, Stefan Sunaert, Patrick Dupont, Michel Koole, Koen Van Laere

JOURNAL: Journal of cerebral blood flow and metabolism : official journal of the International Society of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Preclinical and postmortem studies have suggested that regional synaptic density and glucose consumption (CMRGlc) are strongly related. However, the relation between synaptic density and cerebral glucose metabolism in the human brain has not directly been assessed in vivo. Using [11C]UCB-J binding to synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2 A (SV2A) as indicator for synaptic density and [18F]FDG for measuring cerebral glucose consumption, we studied twenty healthy female subjects (age 29.6 ± 9.9 yrs) who underwent a single-day dual-tracer protocol (GE Signa PET-MR). Global measures of absolute and relative CMRGlc and specific binding of [11C]UCB-J were indeed highly significantly correlated (r> 0.47,p< 0.001). However, regional differences in relative [18F]FDG and [11C]UCB-J uptake were observed, with up to 19% higher [11C]UCB-J uptake in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) and up to 17% higher glucose metabolism in frontal and motor-related areas and thalamus. This pattern has a considerable overlap with the brain regions showing different levels of aerobic glycolysis. Regionally varying energy demands of inhibitory and excitatory synapses at rest may also contribute to this difference. Being unaffected by astroglial and/or microglial energy demands, changes in synaptic density in the MTL may therefore be more sensitive to early detection of pathological conditions compared to changes in glucose metabolism.

TITLE: [18F]FDG PET integrated with structural MRI for accurate brain age prediction

AUTHORS: Le Xue, Yu Fu, Xin Gao, Gang Feng, Shufang Qian, Ling Wei, Lanlan Li, Cheng Zhuo, Hong Zhang, Mei Tian

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Brain aging is a complex and heterogeneous process characterized by both structural and functional decline. This study aimed to establish a novel deep learning (DL) method for predicting brain age by utilizing structural and metabolic imaging data.

Methods: The dataset comprised participants from both the Universal Medical Imaging Diagnostic Center (UMIDC) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). The former recruited 395 normal control (NC) subjects, while the latter included 438 NC subjects, 51 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects, and 56 Alzheimer's disease (AD) subjects. We developed a novel dual-pathway, 3D simple fully convolutional network (Dual-SFCNeXt) to estimate brain age using [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ([18F]FDG PET) and structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) images of NC subjects as input. Several prevailing DL models were trained and tested using either MRI or PET data for comparison. Model accuracies were evaluated using mean absolute error (MAE) and Pearson's correlation coefficient (r). Brain age gap (BAG), deviations of brain age from chronologic age, was correlated with cognitive assessments in MCI and AD subjects.

Results: Both PET- and MRI-based models achieved high prediction accuracy. The leading model was the SFCNeXt (the single-pathway version) for PET (MAE = 2.92, r = 0.96) and MRI (MAE = 3.23, r = 0.95) on all samples. By integrating both PET and MRI images, the Dual-SFCNeXt demonstrated significantly improved accuracy (MAE = 2.37, r = 0.97) compared to all single-modality models. Significantly higher BAG was observed in both the AD (P < 0.0001) and MCI (P < 0.0001) groups compared to the NC group. BAG correlated significantly with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores (r=-0.390 for AD, r=-0.436 for MCI) and the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) scores (r = 0.333 for AD, r = 0.372 for MCI).

Conclusion: The integration of [18F]FDG PET with structural MRI enhances the accuracy of brain age prediction, potentially introducing a new avenue for related multimodal brain age prediction studies.

JOURNAL: Molecular imaging and biology

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Moderate-to-high correlations have been reported between the [11C]PiB PET-derived relative tracer delivery rate R1and relative CBF as measured using [15O]H2O PET, supporting its use as a proxy of relative CBF. As longitudinal PET studies become more common for measuring treatment efficacy or disease progression, it is important to know the intrinsic variability of R1. The purpose of the present study was to determine this through a retrospective data analysis.

Procedures: Test-retest data belonging to twelve participants, who underwent two 90 min [11C]PiB PET scans, were retrospectively included. The voxel-based implementation of the two-step simplified reference tissue model with cerebellar grey matter as reference tissue was used to compute R1images. Next, test-retest variability was calculated, and test and retest R1measures were compared using linear mixed effect models and a Bland-Altman analysis.

Results: Test-retest variability was low across regions (max. 5.8 %), and test and retest measures showed high, significant correlations (R2=0.92, slope=0.98) and a negligible bias (0.69±3.07 %).

Conclusions: In conclusion, the high precision of [11C]PiB R1suggests suitable applicability for cross-sectional and longitudinal studies.

ABSTRACT:
Total metabolic tumor volume (TMTV) is prognostic in lymphoma. However, cutoff values for risk stratification vary markedly, according to the tumor delineation method used. We aimed to create a standardized TMTV benchmark dataset allowing TMTV to be tested and applied as a reproducible biomarker.Methods:Sixty baseline18F-FDG PET/CT scans were identified with a range of disease distributions (20 follicular, 20 Hodgkin, and 20 diffuse large B-cell lymphoma). TMTV was measured by 12 nuclear medicine experts, each analyzing 20 cases split across subtypes, with each case processed by 3-4 readers. LIFEx or ACCURATE software was chosen according to reader preference. Analysis was performed stepwise: TMTV1 with automated preselection of lesions using an SUV of at least 4 and a volume of at least 3 cm3with single-click removal of physiologic uptake; TMTV2 with additional removal of reactive bone marrow and spleen with single clicks; TMTV3 with manual editing to remove other physiologic uptake, if required; and TMTV4 with optional addition of lesions using mouse clicks with an SUV of at least 4 (no volume threshold).Results:The final TMTV (TMTV4) ranged from 8 to 2,288 cm3, showing excellent agreement among all readers in 87% of cases (52/60) with a difference of less than 10% or less than 10 cm3In 70% of the cases, TMTV4 equaled TMTV1, requiring no additional reader interaction. Differences in the TMTV4 were exclusively related to reader interpretation of lesion inclusion or physiologic high-uptake region removal, not to the choice of software. For 5 cases, large TMTV differences (>25%) were due to disagreement about inclusion of diffuse splenic uptake.Conclusion:The proposed segmentation method enabled highly reproducible TMTV measurements, with minimal reader interaction in 70% of the patients. The inclusion or exclusion of diffuse splenic uptake requires definition of specific criteria according to lymphoma subtype. The publicly available proposed benchmark allows comparison of study results and could serve as a reference to test improvements using other segmentation approaches.

TITLE: High-Temporal-Resolution Kinetic Modeling of Lung Tumors with Dual-Blood Input Function Using Total-Body Dynamic PET

AUTHORS: Yiran Wang, Yasser G Abdelhafez, Benjamin A Spencer, Rashmi Verma, Mamta Parikh, Nicholas Stollenwerk, Lorenzo Nardo, Terry Jones, Ramsey D Badawi, Simon R Cherry, Guobao Wang

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
The lungs are supplied by both the pulmonary arteries carrying deoxygenated blood originating from the right ventricle and the bronchial arteries carrying oxygenated blood downstream from the left ventricle. However, this effect of dual blood supply has never been investigated using PET, partially because the temporal resolution of conventional dynamic PET scans is limited. The advent of PET scanners with a long axial field of view, such as the uEXPLORER total-body PET/CT system, permits dynamic imaging with high temporal resolution (HTR). In this work, we modeled the dual-blood input function (DBIF) and studied its impact on the kinetic quantification of normal lung tissue and lung tumors using HTR dynamic PET imaging.Methods:Thirteen healthy subjects and 6 cancer subjects with lung tumors underwent a dynamic18F-FDG scan with the uEXPLORER for 1 h. Data were reconstructed into dynamic frames of 1 s in the early phase. Regional time-activity curves of lung tissue and tumors were analyzed using a 2-tissue compartmental model with 3 different input functions: the right ventricle input function, left ventricle input function, and proposed DBIF, all with time delay and dispersion corrections. These models were compared for time-activity curve fitting quality using the corrected Akaike information criterion and for differentiating lung tumors from lung tissue using the Mann-WhitneyUtest. Voxelwise multiparametric images by the DBIF model were further generated to verify the regional kinetic analysis.Results:The effect of dual blood supply was pronounced in the high-temporal-resolution time-activity curves of lung tumors. The DBIF model achieved better time-activity curve fitting than the other 2 single-input models according to the corrected Akaike information criterion. The estimated fraction of left ventricle input was low in normal lung tissue of healthy subjects but much higher in lung tumors (∼0.04 vs. ∼0.3,P< 0.0003). The DBIF model also showed better robustness in the difference in18F-FDG net influx rate [Formula: see text] and delivery rate [Formula: see text] between lung tumors and normal lung tissue. Multiparametric imaging with the DBIF model further confirmed the differences in tracer kinetics between normal lung tissue and lung tumors.Conclusion:The effect of dual blood supply in the lungs was demonstrated using HTR dynamic imaging and compartmental modeling with the proposed DBIF model. The effect was small in lung tissue but nonnegligible in lung tumors. HTR dynamic imaging with total-body PET can offer a sensitive tool for investigating lung diseases.

TITLE: Different prognostic impact of glucose uptake in visceral adipose tissue according to sex in patients with colorectal cancer

AUTHORS: Jae-Hoon Lee, Soyoung Kim, Hye Sun Lee, Eun Jung Park, Seung Hyuk Baik, Tae Joo Jeon, Kang Young Lee, Young Hoon Ryu, Jeonghyun Kang

JOURNAL: Scientific reports

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
The purpose of this study was to investigate whether sex differences in visceral fat volume and glucose uptake measured by positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) in abdominal visceral fat can stratify overall survival (OS) in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). We retrospectively enrolled 293 patients diagnosed with CRC who underwent PET/CT before surgical resection. Fluorodeoxyglucose uptake of visceral adipose tissue (VAT-SUV) and subcutaneous adiposity tissue (SAT-SUV) were measured using PET/CT. The relative VAT (rVAT) was defined as the visceral fat volume normalized to the total volume of fat (VAT plus SAT). We defined sex-specific cutoff values for VAT-SUV, SAT-SUV, and rVAT. Univariate and multivariate analyses using Cox proportional hazard regression analysis were performed to identify the independent prognostic factors. The study population comprised 181 men and 112 women. The rVAT (0.40 vs. 0.29, p < 0.001) and VAT-SUV (0.55 vs. 0.48, p = 0.007) were significantly greater in men than in women. High rVAT (than low rVAT) and high VAT-SUV (than low VAT-SUV) showed a worse prognosis in male and female patients, respectively. Multivariate analysis indicated that the combination of rVAT and VAT-SUV was an independent prognostic factor for predicting OS in both male and female patients. The combination of rVAT and VAT-SUV could differentiate the patients with the best survival outcome from the other three individual groups in female patients, but not in males. Glucose uptake and relative volume of visceral fat may provide a new risk stratification for patients with CRC, especially female patients.

TITLE: Development and validation of a nomogram for predicting bone marrow involvement in lymphoma patients based on 18F-FDG PET radiomics and clinical factors

AUTHORS: Denglu Lu, Xinyu Zhu, Xingyu Mu, Xiaoqi Huang, Feng Wei, Lilan Qin, Qixin Liu, Wei Fu, Yanyun Deng

JOURNAL: Annals of nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Objective: This study aimed to develop and validate a nomogram combining18F-FDG PET radiomics and clinical factors to non-invasively predict bone marrow involvement (BMI) in patients with lymphoma.

Methods: A radiomics nomogram was developed using monocentric data, randomly divided into a training set (70%) and a test set (30%). Bone marrow biopsy (BMB) served as the gold standard for BMI diagnosis. Independent clinical risk factors were identified through univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses to construct a clinical model. Radiomics features were extracted from PET and CT images and selected using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression, yielding a radiomics score (Radscore) for each patient. Models based on clinical factors, CT Radscore, and PET Radscorewere established and evaluated using eight machine learning algorithms to identify the optimal prediction model. A combined model was constructed and presented as a nomogram. Model performance was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), calibration curves, and decision curve analysis (DCA).

Results: A total of 160 patients were included, of whom 70 had BMI based on BMB results. The training group comprised 112 patients (BMI: 56, without BMI: 56), while the test group included 48 patients (BMI: 14, without BMI: 34). Independent risk factors, including the number of extranodal involvements and B symptoms, were incorporated into the clinical model. In the clinical model, CT Radscore, and PET Radscore, the AUCs in the test set were 0.820 (95% CI: 0.705-0.935), 0.538 (95% CI: 0.351-0.723), and 0.836 (95% CI: 0.686-0.986). Due to the limited diagnostic performance of CT Radscore, the nomogram was constructed using PET Radscoreand the clinical model. The radiomics nomogram achieved AUCs of 0.916 (95% CI: 0.865-0.967) in the training set and 0.863 (95% CI: 0.763-0.964) in the test set. Calibration curves and DCA confirmed the nomogram's discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility in both sets.

Conclusion: By integrating PET Radscore, the number of extranodal involvements, and B symptoms, this18F-FDG PET radiomics-based nomogram offers a non-invasive method to predict bone marrow status in lymphoma patients, providing nuclear medicine physicians with valuable decision support for pre-treatment evaluation.

TITLE: Prognostic value of tumor metabolic imaging phenotype by FDG PET radiomics in HNSCC

AUTHORS: Hyukjin Yoon, Seunggyun Ha, Soo Jin Kwon, Sonya Youngju Park, Jihyun Kim, Joo Hyun O, Ie Ryung Yoo

JOURNAL: Annals of nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Objective: Tumor metabolic phenotype can be assessed with integrated image pattern analysis of18F-fluoro-deoxy-glucose (FDG) Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (PET/CT), called radiomics. This study was performed to assess the prognostic value of radiomics PET parameters in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients.

Methods: 18F-fluoro-deoxy-glucose (FDG) PET/CT data of 215 patients from HNSCC collection free database in The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA), and 122 patients in Seoul St. Mary's Hospital with baseline FDG PET/CT for locally advanced HNSCC were reviewed. Data from TCIA database were used as a training cohort, and data from Seoul St. Mary's Hospital as a validation cohort. With the training cohort, primary tumors were segmented by Nestles' adaptive thresholding method. Segmental tumors in PET images were preprocessed using relative resampling of 64 bins. Forty-two PET parameters, including conventional parameters and texture parameters, were measured. Binary groups of homogeneous imaging phenotypes, clustered by K-means method, were compared for overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) by log-rank test. Selected individual radiomics parameters were tested along with clinical factors, including age and sex, by Cox-regression test for OS and DFS, and the significant parameters were tested with multivariate analysis. Significant parameters on multivariate analysis were again tested with multivariate analysis in the validation cohort.

Results: A total of 119 patients, 70 from training, and 49 from validation cohort, were included in the study. The median follow-up period was 62 and 52 months for the training and the validation cohort, respectively. In the training cohort. binary groups with different metabolic radiomics phenotypes showed significant difference in OS (p = 0.036), and borderline difference in DFS (p = 0.086). Gray-Level Non-Uniformity for zone (GLNUGLZLM) was the most significant prognostic factor for both OS (hazard ratio [HR] 3.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4-7.3, p = 0.008) and DFS (HR 4.5, CI 1.3-16, p = 0.020). Multivariate analysis revealed GLNUGLZLMas an independent prognostic factor for OS (HR 3.7, 95% CI 1.1-7.5, p = 0.032). GLNUGLZLMremained as an independent prognostic factor in the validation cohort (HR 14.8. 95% CI 3.3-66, p < 0.001).

Conclusions: Baseline FDG PET radiomics contain risk information for survival prognosis in HNSCC patients. The metabolic heterogeneity parameter, GLNUGLZLM,may assist clinicians in patient risk assessment as a feasible prognostic factor.

TITLE: Development and validation of [18 F]-PSMA-1007 PET-based radiomics model to predict biochemical recurrence-free survival following radical prostatectomy

AUTHORS: Tiancheng Li, Mimi Xu, Shuye Yang, Guolin Wang, Yinuo Liu, Kaifeng Liu, Kui Zhao, Xinhui Su

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Biochemical recurrence (BCR) following radical prostatectomy (RP) is a significant concern for patients with prostate cancer. Reliable prediction models are needed to identify patients at risk for BCR and facilitate appropriate management. This study aimed to develop and validate a clinical-radiomics model based on preoperative [18 F]PSMA-1007 PET for predicting BCR-free survival (BRFS) in patients who underwent RP for prostate cancer.

Materials and methods: A total of 236 patients with histologically confirmed prostate cancer who underwent RP were retrospectively analyzed. All patients had a preoperative [18 F]PSMA-1007 PET/CT scan. Radiomics features were extracted from the primary tumor region on PET images. A radiomics signature was developed using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression model. The performance of the radiomics signature in predicting BRFS was assessed using Harrell's concordance index (C-index). The clinical-radiomics nomogram was constructed using the radiomics signature and clinical features. The model was externally validated in an independent cohort of 98 patients.

Results: The radiomics signature comprised three features and demonstrated a C-index of 0.76 (95% CI: 0.60-0.91) in the training cohort and 0.71 (95% CI: 0.63-0.79) in the validation cohort. The radiomics signature remained an independent predictor of BRFS in multivariable analysis (HR: 2.48, 95% CI: 1.47-4.17, p < 0.001). The clinical-radiomics nomogram significantly improved the prediction performance (C-index: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.66-0.95, p = 0.007) in the training cohort and (C-index: 0.78 95% CI: 0.63-0.89, p < 0.001) in the validation cohort.

Conclusion: We developed and validated a novel [18 F]PSMA-1007 PET-based clinical-radiomics model that can predict BRFS following RP in prostate cancer patients. This model may be useful in identifying patients with a higher risk of BCR, thus enabling personalized risk stratification and tailored management strategies.

TITLE: Probing the Role of a Regional Quantitative Assessment of Amyloid PET

AUTHORS: Enrico Peira, Matteo Grazzini, Matteo Bauckneht, Francesco Sensi, Paolo Bosco, Dario Arnaldi, Silvia Morbelli, Andrea Chincarini, Matteo Pardini, Flavio Nobili

JOURNAL: Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Background: In clinical practice, the amy-PET is globally inspected to provide a binary outcome, but the role of a regional assessment has not been fully investigated yet.

Objective: To deepen the role of regional amyloid burden and its implication on clinical-neuropsychological features.

Materials: Amy-PET and a complete neuropsychological assessment (Trail Making Test, Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test, semantic verbal fluency, Symbol Digit, Stroop, visuoconstruction) were available in 109 patients with clinical suspicion of Alzheimer's disease. By averaging the standardized uptake value ratio and ELBA, a regional quantification was calculated for each scan. Patients were grouped according to their overall amyloid load: correlation maps, based on regional quantification, were calculated and compared. A regression analysis between neuropsychological assessment and the regional amyloid-β (Aβ) load was carried out.

Results: Significant differences were observed between the correlation maps of patients at increasing levels of Aβ and the overall dataset. The Aβ uptake of the subcortical gray matter resulted not related to other brain regions independently of the global Aβ level. A significant association of semantic verbal fluency was observed with ratios of cortical and subcortical distribution of Aβ which represent a coarse measure of differences in regional distribution of Aβ.

Conclusion: Our observations confirmed the different susceptibility to Aβ accumulation among brain regions. The association between cognition and Aβ distribution deserves further investigations: it is possibly due to a direct local effect or it represents a proxy marker of a more aggressive disease subtype. Regional Aβ assessment represents an available resource on amy-PET scan with possibly clinical and prognostic implications.

TITLE: Personality Impact on Alzheimer's Disease - Signature and Vascular Imaging Markers: A PET-MRI Study

AUTHORS: Panteleimon Giannakopoulos, Cristelle Rodriguez, Marie-Louise Montandon, Valentina Garibotto, Sven Haller, François R Herrmann

JOURNAL: Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Background: Several studies postulated that personality is an independent determinant of cognitive trajectories in old age.

Objective: This study explores the impact of personality on widely used Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular imaging markers.

Methods: We examined the association between personality and three classical AD imaging markers (centiloid-based-amyloid load, MRI volumetry in hippocampus, and media temporal lobe atrophy), and two vascular MRI parameters (Fazekas score and number of cortical microbleeds) assessed at baseline and upon a 54-month-follow-up. Personality was assessed with the Neuroticism Extraversion Openness Personality Inventory-Revised. Regression models were used to identify predictors of imaging markers including sex, personality factors, presence of APOE ɛ4 allele and cognitive evolution over time.

Results: Cortical GM volumes were negatively associated with higher levels of Conscientiousness both at baseline and follow-up. In contrast, higher scores of Openness were related to better preservation of left hippocampal volumes in these two time points and negatively associated with medial temporal atrophy at baseline. Amyloid load was not affected by personality factors. Cases with higher Extraversion scores displayed higher numbers of cortical microbleeds at baseline.

Conclusion: Personality impact on brain morphometry is detected only in some among the routinely used imaging markers. The most robust associations concern the positive role of high levels of Conscientiousness and Openness on AD-signature MRI markers. Higher extraversion levels are associated with increased vulnerability to cortical microbleeds pointing to the fact that the socially favorable traits may have a detrimental effect on brain integrity in old age.

TITLE: Predicting 15O-Water PET cerebral blood flow maps from multi-contrast MRI using a deep convolutional neural network with evaluation of training cohort bias

AUTHORS: Jia Guo, Enhao Gong, Audrey P Fan, Maged Goubran, Mohammad M Khalighi, Greg Zaharchuk

JOURNAL: Journal of cerebral blood flow and metabolism : official journal of the International Society of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
To improve the quality of MRI-based cerebral blood flow (CBF) measurements, a deep convolutional neural network (dCNN) was trained to combine single- and multi-delay arterial spin labeling (ASL) and structural images to predict gold-standard15O-water PET CBF images obtained on a simultaneous PET/MRI scanner. The dCNN was trained and tested on 64 scans in 16 healthy controls (HC) and 16 cerebrovascular disease patients (PT) with 4-fold cross-validation. Fidelity to the PET CBF images and the effects of bias due to training on different cohorts were examined. The dCNN significantly improved CBF image quality compared with ASL alone (mean ± standard deviation): structural similarity index (0.854 ± 0.036 vs. 0.743 ± 0.045 [single-delay] and 0.732 ± 0.041 [multi-delay],P<0.0001); normalized root mean squared error (0.209 ± 0.039 vs. 0.326 ± 0.050 [single-delay] and 0.344 ± 0.055 [multi-delay],P<0.0001). The dCNN also yielded mean CBF with reduced estimation error in both HC and PT (P<0.001), and demonstrated better correlation with PET. The dCNN trained with the mixed HC and PT cohort performed the best. The results also suggested that models should be trained on cases representative of the target population.

JOURNAL: Radiology

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Filters are commonly used to enhance specific structures and patterns in images, such as vessels or peritumoral regions, to enable clinical insights beyond the visible image using radiomics. However, their lack of standardization restricts reproducibility and clinical translation of radiomics decision support tools. In this special report, teams of researchers who developed radiomics software participated in a three-phase study (September 2020 to December 2022) to establish a standardized set of filters. The first two phases focused on finding reference filtered images and reference feature values for commonly used convolutional filters: mean, Laplacian of Gaussian, Laws and Gabor kernels, separable and nonseparable wavelets (including decomposed forms), and Riesz transformations. In the first phase, 15 teams used digital phantoms to establish 33 reference filtered images of 36 filter configurations. In phase 2, 11 teams used a chest CT image to derive reference values for 323 of 396 features computed from filtered images using 22 filter and image processing configurations. Reference filtered images and feature values for Riesz transformations were not established. Reproducibility of standardized convolutional filters was validated on a public data set of multimodal imaging (CT, fluorodeoxyglucose PET, and T1-weighted MRI) in 51 patients with soft-tissue sarcoma. At validation, reproducibility of 486 features computed from filtered images using nine configurations × three imaging modalities was assessed using the lower bounds of 95% CIs of intraclass correlation coefficients. Out of 486 features, 458 were found to be reproducible across nine teams with lower bounds of 95% CIs of intraclass correlation coefficients greater than 0.75. In conclusion, eight filter types were standardized with reference filtered images and reference feature values for verifying and calibrating radiomics software packages. A web-based tool is available for compliance checking.

TITLE: Prostate and dominant intraprostatic lesion segmentation on PET/CT using cascaded regional-net

AUTHORS: Luke A Matkovic, Tonghe Wang, Yang Lei, Oladunni O Akin-Akintayo, Olayinka A Abiodun Ojo, Akinyemi A Akintayo, Justin Roper, Jeffery D Bradley, Tian Liu, David M Schuster, Xiaofeng Yang

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Focal boost to dominant intraprostatic lesions (DILs) has recently been proposed for prostate radiation therapy. Accurate and fast delineation of the prostate and DILs is thus required during treatment planning. In this paper, we develop a learning-based method using positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) images to automatically segment the prostate and its DILs. To enable end-to-end segmentation, a deep learning-based method, called cascaded regional-Net, is utilized. The first network, referred to as dual attention network, is used to segment the prostate via extracting comprehensive features from both PET and CT images. A second network, referred to as mask scoring regional convolutional neural network (MSR-CNN), is used to segment the DILs from the PET and CT within the prostate region. Scoring strategy is used to diminish the misclassification of the DILs. For DIL segmentation, the proposed cascaded regional-Net uses two steps to remove normal tissue regions, with the first step cropping images based on prostate segmentation and the second step using MSR-CNN to further locate the DILs. The binary masks of DILs and prostates of testing patients are generated on the PET/CT images by the trained model. For evaluation, we retrospectively investigated 49 prostate cancer patients with PET/CT images acquired. The prostate and DILs of each patient were contoured by radiation oncologists and set as the ground truths and targets. We used five-fold cross-validation and a hold-out test to train and evaluate our method. The mean surface distance and DSC values were 0.666 ± 0.696 mm and 0.932 ± 0.059 for the prostate and 0.814 ± 1.002 mm and 0.801 ± 0.178 for the DILs among all 49 patients. The proposed method has shown promise for facilitating prostate and DIL delineation for DIL focal boost prostate radiation therapy.

TITLE: Motion-corrected and high-resolution anatomically assisted (MOCHA) reconstruction of arterial spin labeling MRI

AUTHORS: Abolfazl Mehranian, Colm J McGinnity, Radhouene Neji, Claudia Prieto, Alexander Hammers, Enrico De Vita, Andrew J Reader

JOURNAL: Magnetic resonance in medicine

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: A model-based reconstruction framework is proposed for motion-corrected and high-resolution anatomically assisted (MOCHA) reconstruction of arterial spin labeling (ASL) data. In this framework, all low-resolution ASL control-label pairs are used to reconstruct a single high-resolution cerebral blood flow (CBF) map, corrected for rigid-motion, point-spread-function blurring and partial volume effect.

Methods: Six volunteers were recruited for CBF imaging using pseudo-continuous ASL labeling, two-shot 3D gradient and spin-echo sequences and high-resolution T1-weighted MRI. For 2 volunteers, high-resolution scans with double and triple resolution in the partition direction were additionally collected. Simulations were designed for evaluations against a high-resolution ground-truth CBF map, including a simulated hyperperfused lesion and hyperperfusion/hypoperfusion abnormalities. The MOCHA technique was compared with standard reconstruction and a 3D linear regression partial-volume effect correction method and was further evaluated for acquisitions with reduced control-label pairs and k-space undersampling.

Results: The MOCHA reconstructions of low-resolution ASL data showed enhanced image quality, particularly in the partition direction. In simulations, both MOCHA and 3D linear regression provided more accurate CBF maps than the standard reconstruction; however, MOCHA resulted in the lowest errors and well delineated the abnormalities. The MOCHA reconstruction of standard-resolution in vivo data showed good agreement with higher-resolution scans requiring 4-times and 9-times longer acquisitions. The MOCHA reconstruction was found to be robust for 4-times-accelerated ASL acquisitions, achieved by reduced control-label pairs or k-space undersampling.

Conclusion: The MOCHA reconstruction reduces partial-volume effect by direct reconstruction of CBF maps in the high-resolution space of the corresponding anatomical image, incorporating motion correction and point spread function modeling. Following further evaluation, MOCHA should promote the clinical application of ASL.

TITLE: Applications of radiomics and machine learning for radiotherapy of malignant brain tumors

AUTHORS: Martin Kocher, Maximilian I Ruge, Norbert Galldiks, Philipp Lohmann

JOURNAL: Strahlentherapie und Onkologie : Organ der Deutschen Rontgengesellschaft ... [et al]

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Background: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and amino acid positron-emission tomography (PET) of the brain contain a vast amount of structural and functional information that can be analyzed by machine learning algorithms and radiomics for the use of radiotherapy in patients with malignant brain tumors.

Methods: This study is based on comprehensive literature research on machine learning and radiomics analyses in neuroimaging and their potential application for radiotherapy in patients with malignant glioma or brain metastases.

Results: Feature-based radiomics and deep learning-based machine learning methods can be used to improve brain tumor diagnostics and automate various steps of radiotherapy planning. In glioma patients, important applications are the determination of WHO grade and molecular markers for integrated diagnosis in patients not eligible for biopsy or resection, automatic image segmentation for target volume planning, prediction of the location of tumor recurrence, and differentiation of pseudoprogression from actual tumor progression. In patients with brain metastases, radiomics is applied for additional detection of smaller brain metastases, accurate segmentation of multiple larger metastases, prediction of local response after radiosurgery, and differentiation of radiation injury from local brain metastasis relapse. Importantly, high diagnostic accuracies of 80-90% can be achieved by most approaches, despite a large variety in terms of applied imaging techniques and computational methods.

Conclusion: Clinical application of automated image analyses based on radiomics and artificial intelligence has a great potential for improving radiotherapy in patients with malignant brain tumors. However, a common problem associated with these techniques is the large variability and the lack of standardization of the methods applied.

TITLE: Hemodynamic and metabolic correspondence of resting-state voxel-based physiological metrics in healthy adults

AUTHORS: Shengwen Deng, Crystal G Franklin, Michael O'Boyle, Wei Zhang, Betty L Heyl, Paul A Jerabek, Hanzhang Lu, Peter T Fox

JOURNAL: NeuroImage

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Voxel-based physiological (VBP) variables derived from blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) fMRI time-course variations include: amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (ALFF), fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (fALFF) and regional homogeneity (ReHo). Although these BOLD-derived variables can detect between-group (e.g. disease vs control) spatial pattern differences, physiological interpretations are not well established. The primary objective of this study was to quantify spatial correspondences between BOLD VBP variables and PET measurements of cerebral metabolic rate and hemodynamics, being well-validated physiological standards. To this end, quantitative, whole-brain PET images of metabolic rate of glucose (MRGlu;18FDG) and oxygen (MRO2;15OO), blood flow (BF; H215O) and blood volume (BV; C15O) were obtained in 16 healthy controls. In the same subjects, BOLD time-courses were obtained for computation of ALFF, fALFF and ReHo images. PET variables were compared pair-wise with BOLD variables. In group-averaged, across-region analyses, ALFF corresponded significantly only with BV (R = 0.64; p < 0.0001). fALFF corresponded most strongly with MRGlu (R = 0.79; p < 0.0001), but also significantly (p < 0.0001) with MRO2(R = 0.68), BF (R = 0.68) and BV (R=0.68). ReHo performed similarly to fALFF, with significant strong correspondence (p < 0.0001) with MRGlu (R = 0.78), MRO2(R = 0.54), and, but less strongly with BF (R = 0.50) and BV (R=0.50). Mutual information analyses further clarified these physiological interpretations. When conditioned by BV, ALFF retained no significant MRGlu, MRO2or BF information. When conditioned by MRGlu, fALFF and ReHo retained no significant MRO2, BF or BV information. Of concern, however, the strength of PET-BOLD correspondences varied markedly by brain region, which calls for future investigation on physiological interpretations at a regional and per-subject basis.

AUTHORS: Le Wen Chiu, Courtney Lawhn-Heath, Spencer C Behr, Roxanna Juarez, Paola M Perez, Iryna Lobach, Matthew D Bucknor, Thomas A Hope, Robert R Flavell

ABSTRACT:
Bone is the most common site of distant metastatic spread in prostate adenocarcinoma. Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) uptake has been described in both benign and malignant bone lesions, which can lead to false-positive findings on68Ga-PSMA-11 PET. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of68Ga-PSMA-11 PET for osseous prostate cancer metastases and improve bone uptake interpretation using semiquantitative metrics.Methods:Fifty-six prostate cancer patients (18 before prostatectomy and 38 with biochemical recurrence) who underwent68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/MRI or PET/CT examinations with osseous PSMA-ligand uptake were included in the study. Medical records were reviewed retrospectively by board-certified nuclear radiologists to determine true or false positivity based on a composite endpoint. For each avid osseous lesion, we measured biologic volume; size; PSMA Reporting and Data System (RADS) rating; SUVmax; and ratio of lesion SUVmaxto liver, blood pool, and background bone SUVmaxDifferences between benign and malignant lesions were evaluated for statistical significance, and cutoffs for these parameters were determined to maximize diagnostic accuracy.Results:Among 56 participants, 13 (22.8%) had false-positive osseous68Ga-PSMA-11 findings and 43 (76.8%) had true-positive osseous68Ga-PSMA-11 findings. Twenty-two patients (39%) had 1 osseous lesion, 18 (32%) had 2-4 lesions, and 16 (29%) had 5 or more lesions. Cutoffs resulting in statistically significant (P< 0.005) differences between benign and malignant lesions were a PSMA RADS rating of at least 4, an SUVmaxof at least 4.1, and SUVmaxratios of at least 2.11 for lesion to blood pool, at least 0.55 for lesion to liver, and at least 4.4 for lesion to bone. These measurements corresponded to a lesion-based68Ga-PSMA-11 PET lesion detection rate of 80%, 93%, 89%, 21%, and 89%, respectively, for malignancy, and a specificity of 73%, 73%, 73%, 93%, and 60%, respectively.Conclusion:PSMA RADS rating, SUVmax, and SUVmaxratio for lesion to blood pool can help differentiate benign from malignant lesions on68Ga-PSMA-11 PET. An SUVmaxratio of more than 2.2 for lesion to blood pool is a reasonable parameter to support image interpretation and presented a superior lesion detection rate and specificity when compared with visual interpretation by PSMA RADS. These parameters hold clinical value by improving diagnostic accuracy for metastatic prostate cancer on68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/MRI and PET/CT.

AUTHORS: Marie Øbro Fosbøl, Sorel Kurbegovic, Helle Hjorth Johannesen, Martin Andreas Røder, Adam Espe Hansen, Jann Mortensen, Annika Loft, Peter Meidahl Petersen, Jacob Madsen, Klaus Brasso, Andreas Kjaer

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine

ABSTRACT:
The aim of this study was to evaluate the correlation between uptake of the PET ligand68Ga-NOTA-AE105, targeting the urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR), and Gleason score in patients undergoing prostate biopsy.Methods:Patients with clinical suspicion of prostate cancer (PCa) or previously diagnosed with PCa were prospectively enrolled in this phase 2 trial. A combination of uPAR PET and multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) was performed, and the SUV in the primary tumor, as delineated by mpMRI, was measured by 2 independent readers. The correlation between the SUV and the Gleason score obtained by biopsy was assessed.Results:A total of 27 patients had histologically verified PCa visible on mpMRI and constituted the study population. There was a positive correlation between the SUVmaxand the Gleason score (Spearman ρ = 0.55;P= 0.003). Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed an area under the curve of 0.88 (95% CI, 0.67-1.00) for discriminating a Gleason score of greater than or equal to 3 + 4 from a Gleason score of less than or equal to 3 + 3. A cutoff for the tumor SUVmaxcould be established with a sensitivity of 96% (79%-99%) and a specificity of 75% (30%-95%) for detecting a Gleason score of greater than or equal to 3 + 4. For discriminating a Gleason score of greater than or equal to 4 + 3 from a Gleason score of less than or equal to 3 + 4, a cutoff could be established for detecting a Gleason score of greater than or equal to 4 + 3 with a sensitivity of 93% (69%-99%) and a specificity of 62% (36%-82%).Conclusion:SUV measurements from uPAR PET in primary tumors, as delineated by mpMRI, showed a significant correlation with the Gleason score, and the tumor SUVmaxwas able to discriminate between low-risk Gleason score profiles and intermediate risk Gleason score profiles with a high diagnostic accuracy. Consequently, uPAR PET/MRI could be a promising method for the noninvasive evaluation of PCa and might reduce the need for repeated biopsies (e.g., in active surveillance).

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Measuring total metabolic tumor volume (TMTV) on18F-FDG PET/CT images in clinical practice requires a fast, reliable, and easy-to-perform multilesional segmentation workflow. We conducted a field test to derive total metabolic volumes using 5 representative baseline18F-FDG PET/CT scans from patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The scans were transferred to 10 different sites or readers who used different commercially available software platforms to derive TMTV after a recently proposed benchmark workflow. Observed TMTVs were compared with reference values, and overall analysis times were reported. Our results show that TMTVs can be obtained with reasonable accuracy across readers and platforms (within 10% compared with reference benchmark values for most TMTVs) but that processing times can vary considerably depending on reader experience and the software platform. Our study showed that there is an urgent need to improve TMTV segmentation workflows in clinical practice, requiring closer collaboration between users and software vendors.

TITLE: 11C-Methionine PET/CT in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism and inconclusive pre-operative imaging work-up: diagnostic accuracy and role of semi-quantitative analysis

AUTHORS: Daria Maccora, Carmelo Caldarella, Maria Lucia Calcagni

JOURNAL: Annals of nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Objective: 11C-Methionine PET/CT (C-MET) is a promising method in detecting abnormal parathyroid glands in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT). The first aim of the study was to evaluate which is the diagnostic role of C-MET in patients with PHPT and inconclusive pre-operative imaging. Second, we aimed to investigate whether C-MET semi-quantitative parameters may reflect biochemical and histological characteristics of involved glands.

Methods: Patients with PHPT, undergoing C-MET after an inconclusive pre-operative imaging and having a parathyroid surgery, were retrospectively included. C-MET visual and semi-quantitative assessment was performed. Parameters, as SUVmax, SUVpeak, SUVmean, functional lesion volume (FLV) and total lesion activity (TLA), were measured for each detected lesion; SUVmean, FLV and TLA were calculated on 40-90% thresholds of SUVmaxto define SUVmean40-90, FLV40-90and TLA40-90,respectively. Results were correlated with patients' clinical-laboratory (calcium and PTH values) and histological data (size and weight of excised glands). Mann-Whitney test was used and P value < 0.05 was considered significant.

Results: Thirty-eight patients (36 female, age: 57.69 ± 15.13 years) were included. Pre-operative median calcium and PTH values were 11.1 mg/dl [interquartile range (IQR) 10.6-11.5] and 154.6 pg/ml (IQR 101.8-227.0), respectively. C-MET showed a parathyroid uptake in 30 out of thirty-eight patients (78.9%). Among 42 nodules excised, C-MET correctly detected the side of the neck (right/left) in 30/42 with sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 79, 75 and 79%, respectively. C-MET correctly identified the exact position (superior/inferior) in 27/42 with sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 75, 50 and 71%, respectively. SUVpeak, FLV50-70and TLA40-70were significantly (P < 0.05) higher in patients with higher PTH results. The histological size resulted significantly (P < 0.05) higher in abnormal glands with higher SUVmax, SUVpeak, FLV40-80and TLA40-90, the weight was higher in glands with higher SUVpeak, SUVmean40-50, FLV40-80and TLA40-90.

Conclusions: C-MET showed a good performance in detecting hyperfunctioning parathyroid glands in PHPT patients with inconclusive pre-operative imaging. Semi-quantitative PET-derived parameters closely correlated with PTH as well as with size and weight of the excised gland, thus reflecting some biochemical and histological characteristics of involved glands.

Background: This study aims to compare proton density weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) zero echo time (ZTE) and head atlas attenuation correction (AC) to the reference standard computed tomography (CT) based AC for11C-methionine positron emission tomography (PET)/MRI.

Methods: A retrospective cohort of 14 patients with suspected or confirmed brain tumour and11C-Methionine PET/MRI was included in the study. For each scan, three AC maps were generated: ZTE-AC, atlas-AC and reference standard CT-AC. Maximum and mean standardised uptake values (SUV) were measured in the hotspot, mirror region and frontal cortex. In postoperative patients (n = 8), SUV values were additionally obtained adjacent to the metal implant and mirror region. Standardised uptake ratios (SUR) hotspot/mirror, hotspot/cortex and metal/mirror were then calculated and analysed with Bland-Altman, Pearson correlation and intraclass correlation reliability in the overall group and subgroups.

Results: ZTE-AC demonstrated narrower SD and 95% CI (Bland-Altman) than atlas-AC in the hotspot analysis for all groups (ZTE overall ≤ 2.84, - 1.41 to 1.70; metal ≤ 1.67, - 3.00 to 2.20; non-metal ≤ 3.04, - 0.96 to 3.38; Atlas overall ≤ 4.56, - 1.05 to 3.83; metal ≤ 3.87, - 3.81 to 4.64; non-metal ≤ 4.90, - 1.68 to 5.86). The mean bias for both ZTE-AC and atlas-AC was ≤ 2.4% compared to CT-AC. In the metal region analysis, ZTE-AC demonstrated a narrower mean bias range-closer to zero-and narrower SD and 95% CI (ZTE 0.21-0.48, ≤ 2.50, - 1.70 to 2.57; Atlas 0.56-1.54, ≤ 4.01, - 1.81 to 4.89). The mean bias for both ZTE-AC and atlas-AC was within 1.6%. A perfect correlation (Pearson correlation) was found for both ZTE-AC and atlas-AC compared to CT-AC in the hotspot and metal analysis (ZTE ρ 1.00, p < 0.0001; atlas ρ 1.00, p < 0.0001). An almost perfect intraclass correlation coefficient for absolute agreement was found between Atlas-, ZTE and CT maps for maxSUR and meanSUR values in all the analyses (ICC > 0.99).

Conclusions: Both ZTE and atlas-AC showed a good performance against CT-AC in patients with brain tumour.

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: This study compared the prognostic value of total metabolic tumor volume (TMTV) in lymphoma measured with the recently proposed SUV4.0 segmentation threshold versus the 41% SUVmax across LYSA trials and its impact on intensity and dissemination PET features.

Methods: A total of 1960 baseline PET/CT scans of Diffuse Large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), follicular lymphoma (FL) and Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) patients were collected. After a semi-automatic preselection of region of interest, two different segmentation threshold were applied: 41% SUVmax (TMTV41%) and SUV > 4.0 (TMTV4.0).

Results: The correlation between TMTV4.0and TMTV41%was ρ = 0.90 for DLBCL, ρ = 0.65 for FL and ρ = 0.60 for HL. For SUVmax, SUVpeak, Dmax and Dbulk features, a strong correlation was observed with ρ > 0.95 whatever the lymphoma subtypes. The predictability of TMTV was high and comparable for the two methods with superimposable confidence intervals for the three subtypes. At the 90th percentile TMTV value, the predicted 7-year PFS was 51.13% with TMTV4.0vs. 49.7% with TMTV41%for DLBCL patients, 45.5% vs. 39.8% for FL patients, and 82.6% vs. 80.5% for HL patients. A minority of patients showed a predicted PFS deviation > 10% between the two methods: 2.33% in DLBCL, 6.51% in FL and 1% in HL.

Conclusion: TMTV measured with the SUV4.0 threshold provides a comparable PFS prediction than the 41%SUVmax method supporting its routine adoption particularly in the diffuse large B cell lymphoma subtype.

ABSTRACT:
While targeted therapies exist for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive (HER2 +) breast cancer, HER2 + patients do not always respond to therapy. We present the results of utilizing a biophysical mathematical model to predict tumor response for two HER2 + breast cancer patients treated with the same therapeutic regimen but who achieved different treatment outcomes. Quantitative data from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and64Cu-DOTA-trastuzumab positron emission tomography (PET) are used to estimate tumor density, perfusion, and distribution of HER2-targeted antibodies for each individual patient. MRI and PET data are collected prior to therapy, and follow-up MRI scans are acquired at a midpoint in therapy. Given these data types, we align the data sets to a common image space to enable model calibration. Once the model is parameterized with these data, we forecast treatment response with and without HER2-targeted therapy. By incorporating targeted therapy into the model, the resulting predictions are able to distinguish between the two different patient responses, increasing the difference in tumor volume change between the two patients by > 40%. This work provides a proof-of-concept strategy for processing and integrating PET and MRI modalities into a predictive, clinical-mathematical framework to provide patient-specific predictions of HER2 + treatment response.

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Metabolic tumor volume (MTV) on interim PET (I-PET) is a potential prognostic biomarker for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Implementation of MTV on I-PET requires a consensus on which semiautomated segmentation method delineates lesions most successfully with least user interaction. Methods used for baseline PET are not necessarily optimal for I-PET because of lower lesional SUVs at I-PET. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate which method provides the best delineation quality for Deauville score (DS) 4-5 DLBCL lesions on I-PET at the best interobserver agreement on delineation quality and, second, to assess the effect of lesional SUVmaxon delineation quality and performance agreement.Methods:DS 4-5 lesions from 45 I-PET scans were delineated using 6 semiautomated methods: a fixed SUV threshold of 2.5 g/cm3, a fixed SUV threshold of 4.0 g/cm3, an adaptive threshold corrected for source-to-local background activity contrast at 50% of the SUVpeak, 41% of SUVmaxper lesion, a majority vote including voxels detected by at least 2 methods, and a majority vote including voxels detected by at least 3 methods (MV3). Delineation quality per MTV was rated by 3 independent observers as acceptable or nonacceptable. For each method, observer scores on delineation quality, specific agreement, and MTV were assessed for all lesions and per category of lesional SUVmax(<5, 5-10, >10).Results:In 60 DS 4-5 lesions on I-PET, MV3 performed best, with acceptable delineation in 90% of lesions and a positive agreement of 93%. Delineation quality scores and agreement per method strongly depended on lesional SUV: the best delineation quality scores were obtained using MV3 in lesions with an SUVmaxof less than 10 and using SUV4.0 in more18F-FDG-avid lesions. Consequently, overall delineation quality and positive agreement improved by applying the most preferred method per SUV category instead of using MV3 as the single best method. The MV3- and SUV4.0-derived MTVs of lesions with an SUVmaxof more than 10 were comparable after exclusion of visually failed MV3 contouring. For lesions with an SUVmaxof less than 10, MTVs using different methods correlated poorly.Conclusion:On I-PET, MV3 performed best and provided the highest interobserver agreement regarding acceptable delineations of DS 4-5 DLBCL lesions. However, delineation-method preference strongly depended on lesional SUV. Therefore, we suggest exploration of an approach that identifies the optimal delineation method per lesion as a function of tumor18F-FDG uptake characteristics, that is, SUVmax.

JOURNAL: Human brain mapping

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
The use of machine learning (ML) algorithms has significantly increased in neuroscience. However, from the vast extent of possible ML algorithms, which one is the optimal model to predict the target variable? What are the hyperparameters for such a model? Given the plethora of possible answers to these questions, in the last years, automated ML (autoML) has been gaining attention. Here, we apply an autoML library called Tree-based Pipeline Optimisation Tool (TPOT) which uses a tree-based representation of ML pipelines and conducts a genetic programming-based approach to find the model and its hyperparameters that more closely predicts the subject's true age. To explore autoML and evaluate its efficacy within neuroimaging data sets, we chose a problem that has been the focus of previous extensive study: brain age prediction. Without any prior knowledge, TPOT was able to scan through the model space and create pipelines that outperformed the state-of-the-art accuracy for Freesurfer-based models using only thickness and volume information for anatomical structure. In particular, we compared the performance of TPOT (mean absolute error [MAE]: 4.612 ± .124 years) and a relevance vector regression (MAE 5.474 ± .140 years). TPOT also suggested interesting combinations of models that do not match the current most used models for brain prediction but generalise well to unseen data. AutoML showed promising results as a data-driven approach to find optimal models for neuroimaging applications.

ABSTRACT:
Aim: To explore the potentiality of radiomics analysis, performed on Ga-DOTATOC and fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (F-FDG) PET/computed tomography (CT) images, in predicting tumour aggressiveness and outcome in patients candidate to surgery for pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (PanNENs).

Patients and methods: Retrospective study including 61 patients who underwent Ga-DOTATOC and F-FDG PET/CT before surgery for PanNEN. Semiquantitative variables [SUVmax and somatostatin receptor density (SRD) for Ga-DOTATOC PET; SUVmax and MTV for F-FDG PET] and texture features [intensity variability, size zone variability (SZV), zone percentage, entropy; homogeneity, dissimilarity and coefficient of variation (Co-V)] have been analysed to evaluate their possible role in predicting tumour characteristics. Principal component analysis (PCA) was firstly performed and then multiple regression analyses were performed by using the extracted principal components.

Results: Regarding Ga-DOTATOC PET, SZV, entropy, intensity variability and SRD were predictive for tumour dimension. Regarding F-FDG PET, intensity variability, SZV, homogeneity, SUVmax and MTV were predictive for tumour dimension. Four principal components were extracted from PCA: PC1 correlated with all F-FDG variables, while PC2, PC3 and PC4 with Ga-DOTATOC variables. PC1 was the only significantly predicting angioinvasion (P = 0.0222); PC4 was the only one significantly predicting lymph nodal involvement (P = 0.0151). All principal components except PC4 significantly predicted tumour dimension (P <0.0001 for PC1, P = 0.0016 for PC2 and P < 0.0001 for PC3). Co-V from Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT was predictive of the outcome.

Conclusion: Specific texture features derived from preoperative Ga-DOTATOC and F-FDG PET/CT could noninvasively predict specific tumour characteristics and patients' outcome, delineating the potential role of dual tracer technique and texture analysis in the risk assessment of patients with PanNENs.

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Radiomics has revolutionized clinical research by enabling objective measurements of imaging-derived biomarkers. However, the true potential of radiomics necessitates a comprehensive understanding of the biological basis of extracted features to serve as a clinical decision support. In this work, we propose an end-to-end framework for the in silico simulation of [18F]FLT PET imaging process in Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma, accounting for the biological characterization of tissues (including perfusion and fibrosis) on tracer delivery. We thus establish a direct association between radiomics features and the underlying biological properties of tissues.

Methods: We considered 4 immunohistochemically stained Whole Slide Images of pancreatic tissue of one healthy control and three patients with PDAC and/or precursor lesions. From marker-specific images, tissue-depending diffusivity properties were estimated and computational domains were built to simulate the [18F]FLT spatial-temporal uptake exploiting Partial Differential Equations and Finite Elements Method. Consequently, we simulated the imaging process obtaining surrogated PET images for the considered patients, and we performed image-derived features extraction from PET images to be mapped with biological properties via correlation estimation.

Results: The framework captured the phenotypic differences and generated Time Activity Curves reflecting the underlying tissue composition. Image-derived biomarkers were ranked in view of their association with biological characteristics of the tissue, unveiling their molecular correlative. Moreover, we showed that the proposed pipeline could serve as a digital phantom to optimize the image acquisition for lesion detection.

Conclusions: This innovative framework holds the potential to enhance interpretability and reliability of radiomics, fostering the adoption in personalized nuclear medicine and patient care.

ABSTRACT:
Dopamine depletion and microstructural degradation underlie the neurodegenerative processes in Parkinson's disease (PD). To explore early alterations and underlying associations of dopamine and microstructure in PD patients utilizing the hybrid positron emission tomography (PET)-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Twenty-five PD patients in early stages and twenty-four matched healthy controls underwent hybrid18F-fluorodopa (DOPA) PET-diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) scanning. The striatal standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR), DTI maps (fractional anisotropy, FA; mean diffusivity, MD) in subcortical grey matter, and deterministic tractography of the nigrostriatal pathway were processed. Values in more affected (MA) side, less affected (LA) side and mean were analysed. Correlations and mediations among PET, DTI and clinical characteristics were further analysed. PD groups exhibited asymmetric pattern of dopaminergic dysfunction in putamen, impaired integrity in the microstructures (nigral FA, putaminal MD, and FA of nigrostriatal projection). On MA side, significant associations between DTI metrics (nigral FA, putaminal MD, and FA of nigrostriatal projection) and motor performance were significantly mediated by putaminal SUVR, respectively. Early asymmetric disruptions in putaminal dopamine concentrations and nigrostriatal pathway microstructure were detected using hybrid PET-MRI. The findings further implied that molecular degeneration mediates the modulation of microstructural disorganization on motor dysfunction in the early stages of PD.

AUTHORS: Xiaohui Chen, Hongliang Qi, Yijin Zou, Ye Chen, Hanwei Li, Debin Hu, Li Jiang, Meng Wang, Li Chen, Hongwen Chen, Hubing Wu

JOURNAL: Nuclear medicine communications

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Objective: This study aimed to develop an effective radiomics-clinical model to preoperatively discriminate the spread through air spaces (STAS) in lung adenocarcinoma (ADC).

Methods: Data from 192 ADC patients were enrolled, with 2/3 ( n = 128) allocated as the training cohort and the remaining 1/3 ( n = 64) designated as the validation cohort. A total of 2212 radiomics features were extracted from PET/computed tomography (PET/CT) images. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression method was applied to select features. Logistic regression was used to construct radiomics and clinical models. Finally, a radiomics-clinical model that combined clinical with radiomics features was developed. The models were evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and decision curve analysis.

Results: The area under the ROC curve (AUC) of the radiomics-clinical model was 0.924 (95% confidence interval, 0.878-0.969) in the training cohort and 0.919 (0.833-1.000) in the validation cohort. The AUC of the radiomics model was 0.885 (0.825-0.945) in the training cohort and 0.877 (0.766-0.988) in the validation cohort. The AUC of the clinical model was 0.883 (0.814-0.951) in the training cohort and 0.896 (0.7706-1.000) in the validation cohort. The decision curve analysis indicated its clinical usefulness.

Conclusion: The PET/CT-based radiomics-clinical model achieved satisfactory performance in discriminating the STAS in ADC preoperatively.

ABSTRACT:
With the largest high-risk prostate cancer (PCa) cohort to date undergoing68Ga-prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET/CT primary staging, we aimed to, first, characterize the metastatic spread of PCa in relation to tumor68Ga-PSMA uptake and the D'Amico classification and, second, compare68Ga-PSMA PET/CT findings with radical prostatectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) histopathology findings.Methods:The study included 691 consecutive newly diagnosed, biopsy-proven, treatment-naïve, D'Amico high-risk PCa patients primary-staged by68Ga-PSMA PET/CT. PSMA SUVmaxand metastatic findings were compared with prostate-specific antigen level, International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) grade, and clinical stage as traditional risk stratification parameters. Moreover,68Ga-PSMA PET/CT findings were compared with histology findings in radical prostatectomy patients undergoing PLND. Undetected lymph node metastases (LNMs) underwent immunohistochemical PSMA staining.Results:Advanced disease (N1/M1) was observed in 35.3% of patients (244/691) and was associated with increasing prostate-specific antigen level, ISUP grade, and clinical stage. LNMs (N1/M1a) were detected in 31.4% (217/691) and bone metastases (M1b) in 16.8% (116/691). Advanced disease frequencies in patients with ISUP grades 2 and 3 were 10.8% (11/102) and 37.1% (33/89), respectively. Risk of advanced disease for cT2a, cT2b, and cT2c tumors was almost equal (24.2%, 27.9%, and 22.4%, respectively). We observed a weak correlation between SUVmaxand biopsy ISUP grade (ρ = 0.21;P< 0.001) and a modest correlation between SUVmaxand postprostatectomy ISUP grade (ρ = 0.38;P< 0.001). Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value, and accuracy for LNM detection on68Ga-PSMA PET/CT in the PLND cohort were 30.6%, 96.5%, 68.8%, 84.5%, and 83.1%, respectively. Undetected LNMs either were micrometastases located in the lymph node border or were without PSMA expression.Conclusion:In this high-risk PCa cohort, we identified advanced disease in about one third at diagnosis. ISUP grade was the superior predictor for advanced disease at diagnosis. We found a significant difference in frequency of advanced disease between ISUP grades 2 and 3, as supports the Gleason score 7 subdivision. Interestingly, we observed no significant differences in risk of advanced disease when comparing the different cT2 stages. The undetected LNMs were either PSMA-negative or micrometastases.

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Background: Fibroblast activation protein (FAP) as a specific marker of activated fibroblasts can be visualized by positron emission tomography (PET) using Ga-68-FAP inhibitors (FAPI). Gallium-68-labeled FAPI is increasingly used in the staging of various cancers. In addition, the first cases of theranostic approaches have been reported. In this work, we describe the phenomenon of myocardial FAPI uptake in patients who received a Ga-68 FAPI PET for tumor staging.

Method and results: Ga-68 FAPI PET examinations for cancer staging were retrospectively analyzed with respect to cardiac tracer uptake. Standardized uptake values (SUV) were correlated to clinical covariates in a univariate regression model. From 09/2018 to 11/2019 N = 32 patients underwent FAPI PET at our institution. Six out of 32 patients (18.8%) demonstrated increased localized myocardial tracer accumulation, with remote FAPI uptake being significantly higher in patients with vs without localized focal myocardial uptake (SUVmax2.2 ± .6 vs 1.5 ± .4, P < .05 and SUVmean1.6 ± .4 vs 1.2 ± .3, P < .05, respectively). Univariate regression demonstrated a significant correlation of coronary artery disease (CAD), age and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) with remote SUVmeanuptake, the latter with a very strong correlation with remote uptake (R2= .74, P < .01).

Conclusion: Our study indicates an association of CAD, age, and LVEF with FAPI uptake. Further studies are warranted to assess if fibroblast activation can be reliably measured and may be used for risk stratification regarding early detection or progression of CAD and left ventricular remodeling.

ABSTRACT:
Coronary18F-sodium fluoride (18F-NaF) PET and CT angiography-based quantitative plaque analysis have shown promise in refining risk stratification in patients with coronary artery disease. We combined both of these novel imaging approaches to develop an optimal machine-learning model for the future risk of myocardial infarction in patients with stable coronary disease.Methods:Patients with known coronary artery disease underwent coronary18F-NaF PET and CT angiography on a hybrid PET/CT scanner. Machine-learning by extreme gradient boosting was trained using clinical data, CT quantitative plaque analysis, measures and18F-NaF PET, and it was tested using repeated 10-fold hold-out testing.Results:Among 293 study participants (65 ± 9 y; 84% male), 22 subjects experienced a myocardial infarction over the 53 (40-59) months of follow-up. On univariable receiver-operator-curve analysis, only18F-NaF coronary uptake emerged as a predictor of myocardial infarction (c-statistic 0.76, 95% CI 0.68-0.83). When incorporated into machine-learning models, clinical characteristics showed limited predictive performance (c-statistic 0.64, 95% CI 0.53-0.76) and were outperformed by a quantitative plaque analysis-based machine-learning model (c-statistic 0.72, 95% CI 0.60-0.84). After inclusion of all available data (clinical, quantitative plaque and18F-NaF PET), we achieved a substantial improvement (P= 0.008 versus18F-NaF PET alone) in the model performance (c-statistic 0.85, 95% CI 0.79-0.91).Conclusion:Both18F-NaF uptake and quantitative plaque analysis measures are additive and strong predictors of outcome in patients with established coronary artery disease. Optimal risk stratification can be achieved by combining clinical data with these approaches in a machine-learning model.

ABSTRACT:
The current study aimed to predict lymphovascular invasion (LVI) using multiple machine learning algorithms and multi-segmentation positron emission tomography (PET) radiomics in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, offering new avenues for personalized treatment strategies and improving patient outcomes. One hundred and twenty-six patients with NSCLC were enrolled in this study. Various automated and semi-automated PET image segmentation methods were applied, including Local Active Contour (LAC), Fuzzy-C-mean (FCM), K-means (KM), Watershed, Region Growing (RG), and Iterative thresholding (IT) with different percentages of the threshold. One hundred five radiomic features were extracted from each region of interest (ROI). Multiple feature selection methods, including Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (MRMR), Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), and Boruta, and multiple classifiers, including Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Logistic Regression (LR), XGBoost (XGB), Naive Bayes (NB), and Random Forest (RF), were employed. Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) was also used to determine if it boosts the area under the ROC curve (AUC), accuracy (ACC), sensitivity (SEN), and specificity (SPE). Our results indicated that the combination of SMOTE, IT (with 45% threshold), RFE feature selection and LR classifier showed the best performance (AUC = 0.93, ACC = 0.84, SEN = 0.85, SPE = 0.84) followed by SMOTE, FCM segmentation, MRMR feature selection, and LR classifier (AUC = 0.92, ACC = 0.87, SEN = 1, SPE = 0.84). The highest ACC belonged to the IT segmentation (with 45 and 50% thresholds) alongside Boruta feature selection and the NB classifier without SMOTE (ACC = 0.9, AUC = 0.78 and 0.76, SEN = 0.7, and SPE = 0.94, respectively). Our results indicate that selection of appropriate segmentation method and machine learning algorithm may be helpful in successful prediction of LVI in patients with NSCLC with high accuracy using PET radiomics analysis.

ABSTRACT:
Learning-induced neuroplastic changes, further modulated by content and setting, are mirrored in brain functional connectivity (FC). In animal models, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have been shown to facilitate neuroplasticity. This is especially prominent during emotional relearning, such as fear extinction, which may translate to clinical improvements in patients. To investigate a comparable modulation of neuroplasticity in humans, 99 healthy subjects underwent three weeks of emotional (matching faces) or non-emotional learning (matching Chinese characters to unrelated German nouns). Shuffled pairings of the original content were subsequently relearned for the same time. During relearning, subjects received either a daily dose of the SSRI escitalopram or placebo. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was performed before and after the (re-)learning phases. FC changes in a network comprising Broca's area, the medial prefrontal cortex, the right inferior temporal and left lingual gyrus were modulated by escitalopram intake. More specifically, it increased the bidirectional connectivity between medial prefrontal cortex and lingual gyrus for non-emotional and the connectivity from medial prefrontal cortex to Broca's area for emotional relearning. The context dependence of these effects together with behavioral correlations supports the assumption that SSRIs in clinical practice improve neuroplasticity rather than psychiatric symptoms per se. Beyond expanding the complexities of learning, these findings emphasize the influence of external factors on human neuroplasticity.

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Simultaneous PET-MRI improves inflammatory cardiac disease diagnosis. However, challenges persist in respiratory motion and mis-registration between free-breathing 3D PET and 2D breath-held MR images. We propose a free-breathing non-rigid motion-compensated 3D T2-mapping sequence enabling whole-heart myocardial tissue characterization in a hybrid 3T PET-MR system and provides non-rigid respiratory motion fields to correct also simultaneously acquired PET data.

Methods: Free-breathing 3D whole-heart T2-mapping was implemented on a hybrid 3T PET-MRI system. Three datasets were acquired with different T2-preparation modules (0, 28, 55 ms) using 3-fold undersampled variable-density Cartesian trajectory. Respiratory motion was estimated via virtual 3D image navigators, enabling multi-contrast non-rigid motion-corrected MR reconstruction. T2-maps were computed using dictionary-matching. Approach was tested in phantom, 8 healthy subjects, 14 MR only and 2 PET-MR patients with suspected cardiac disease and compared with spin echo reference (phantom) and clinical 2D T2-mapping (in-vivo).

Results: Phantom results show a high correlation (R2= 0.996) between proposed approach and gold standard 2D T2mapping. In-vivo 3D T2-mapping average values in healthy subjects (39.0 ± 1.4 ms) and patients (healthy tissue) (39.1 ± 1.4 ms) agree with conventional 2D T2-mapping (healthy = 38.6 ± 1.2 ms, patients = 40.3 ± 1.7 ms). Bland-Altman analysis reveals bias of 1.8 ms and 95% limits of agreement (LOA) of -2.4-6 ms for healthy subjects, and bias of 1.3 ms and 95% LOA of -1.9 to 4.6 ms for patients.

Conclusion: Validated efficient 3D whole-heart T2-mapping at hybrid 3T PET-MRI provides myocardial inflammation characterization and non-rigid respiratory motion fields for simultaneous PET data correction. Comparable T2values were achieved with both 3D and 2D methods. Improved image quality was observed in the PET images after MR-based motion correction.

TITLE: A deep learning model for generating [18F]FDG PET Images from early-phase [18F]Florbetapir and [18F]Flutemetamol PET images

ABSTRACT:
Introduction: Amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques is a significant hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), detectable via amyloid-PET imaging. The Fluorine-18-Fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]FDG) PET scan tracks cerebral glucose metabolism, correlated with synaptic dysfunction and disease progression and is complementary for AD diagnosis. Dual-scan acquisitions of amyloid PET allows the possibility to use early-phase amyloid-PET as a biomarker for neurodegeneration, proven to have a good correlation to [18F]FDG PET. The aim of this study was to evaluate the added value of synthesizing the later from the former through deep learning (DL), aiming at reducing the number of PET scans, radiation dose, and discomfort to patients.

Methods: A total of 166 subjects including cognitively unimpaired individuals (N = 72), subjects with mild cognitive impairment (N = 73) and dementia (N = 21) were included in this study. All underwent T1-weighted MRI, dual-phase amyloid PET scans using either Fluorine-18 Florbetapir ([18F]FBP) or Fluorine-18 Flutemetamol ([18F]FMM), and an [18F]FDG PET scan. Two transformer-based DL models called SwinUNETR were trained separately to synthesize the [18F]FDG from early phase [18F]FBP and [18F]FMM (eFBP/eFMM). A clinical similarity score (1: no similarity to 3: similar) was assessed to compare the imaging information obtained by synthesized [18F]FDG as well as eFBP/eFMM to actual [18F]FDG. Quantitative evaluations include region wise correlation and single-subject voxel-wise analyses in comparison with a reference [18F]FDG PET healthy control database. Dice coefficients were calculated to quantify the whole-brain spatial overlap between hypometabolic ([18F]FDG PET) and hypoperfused (eFBP/eFMM) binary maps at the single-subject level as well as between [18F]FDG PET and synthetic [18F]FDG PET hypometabolic binary maps.

Results: The clinical evaluation showed that, in comparison to eFBP/eFMM (average of clinical similarity score (CSS) = 1.53), the synthetic [18F]FDG images are quite similar to the actual [18F]FDG images (average of CSS = 2.7) in terms of preserving clinically relevant uptake patterns. The single-subject voxel-wise analyses showed that at the group level, the Dice scores improved by around 13% and 5% when using the DL approach for eFBP and eFMM, respectively. The correlation analysis results indicated a relatively strong correlation between eFBP/eFMM and [18F]FDG (eFBP: slope = 0.77, R2= 0.61, P-value < 0.0001); eFMM: slope = 0.77, R2= 0.61, P-value < 0.0001). This correlation improved for synthetic [18F]FDG (synthetic [18F]FDG generated from eFBP (slope = 1.00, R2= 0.68, P-value < 0.0001), eFMM (slope = 0.93, R2= 0.72, P-value < 0.0001)).

Conclusion: We proposed a DL model for generating the [18F]FDG from eFBP/eFMM PET images. This method may be used as an alternative for multiple radiotracer scanning in research and clinical settings allowing to adopt the currently validated [18F]FDG PET normal reference databases for data analysis.

ABSTRACT:
We investigated the sensitivity of regional tumor response prediction to variability in voxel clustering techniques, imaging features, and machine learning algorithms in 25 patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC) enrolled on the FLARE-RT clinical trial. Metabolic tumor volumes (MTV) from pre-chemoradiation (PETpre) and mid-chemoradiation fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG PET) images (PETmid) were subdivided into K-means or hierarchical voxel clusters by standardized uptake values (SUV) and 3D-positions. MTV cluster separability was evaluated by CH index, and morphologic changes were captured by Dice similarity and centroid Euclidean distance. PETpre conventional features included SUVmean, MTV/MTV cluster size, and mean radiation dose. PETpre radiomics consisted of 41 intensity histogram and 3D texture features (PET Oncology Radiomics Test Suite) extracted from MTV or MTV clusters. Machine learning models (multiple linear regression, support vector regression, logistic regression, support vector machines) of conventional features or radiomic features were constructed to predict PETmid response. Leave-one-out-cross-validated root-mean-squared-error (RMSE) for continuous response regression (ΔSUVmean) and area-under-receiver-operating-characteristic-curve (AUC) for binary response classification were calculated. K-means MTV 2-clusters (MTVhi, MTVlo) achieved maximum CH index separability (Friedman p < 0.001). Between PETpre and PETmid, MTV cluster pairs overlapped (Dice 0.70-0.87) and migrated 0.6-1.1 cm. PETmid ΔSUVmean response prediction was superior in MTV and MTVlo (RMSE = 0.17-0.21) compared to MTVhi (RMSE = 0.42-0.52, Friedman p < 0.001). PETmid ΔSUVmean response class prediction performance trended higher in MTVlo (AUC = 0.83-0.88) compared to MTVhi (AUC = 0.44-0.58, Friedman p = 0.052). Models were more sensitive to MTV/MTV cluster regions (Friedman p = 0.026) than feature sets/algorithms (Wilcoxon signed-rank p = 0.36). Top-ranked radiomic features included GLZSM-LZHGE (large-zone-high-SUV), GTSDM-CP (cluster-prominence), GTSDM-CS (cluster-shade) and NGTDM-CNT (contrast). Top-ranked features were consistent between MTVhi and MTVlo cluster pairs but varied between MTVhi-MTVlo clusters, reflecting distinct regional radiomic phenotypes. Variability in tumor voxel cluster response prediction can inform robust radiomic target definition for risk-adaptive chemoradiation in patients with LA-NSCLC. FLARE-RT trial:NCT02773238.

JOURNAL: Theranostics

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Rationale:The clinical application of biomarkers reflecting tumor immune microenvironment is hurdled by the invasiveness of obtaining tissues despite its importance in immunotherapy. We developed a deep learning-based biomarker which noninvasively estimates a tumor immune profile with fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD).Methods:A deep learning model to predict cytolytic activity score (CytAct) using semi-automatically segmented tumors on FDG-PET trained by a publicly available dataset paired with tissue RNA sequencing (n = 93). This model was validated in two independent cohorts of LUAD: SNUH (n = 43) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort (n = 16). The model was applied to the immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) cohort, which consists of patients with metastatic LUAD who underwent ICB treatment (n = 29).Results:The predicted CytAct showed a positive correlation with CytAct of RNA sequencing in validation cohorts (Spearman rho = 0.32,p =0.04 in SNUH cohort; spearman rho = 0.47,p =0.07 in TCGA cohort). In ICB cohort, the higher predicted CytAct of individual lesion was associated with more decrement in tumor size after ICB treatment (Spearman rho = -0.54,p <0.001). Higher minimum predicted CytAct in each patient associated with significantly prolonged progression free survival and overall survival (Hazard ratio 0.25,p =0.001 and 0.18,p =0.004, respectively). In patients with multiple lesions, ICB responders had significantly lower variance of predicted CytActs (p =0.005).Conclusion:The deep learning model that predicts CytAct using FDG-PET of LUAD was validated in independent cohorts. Our approach may be used to noninvasively assess an immune profile and predict outcomes of LUAD patients treated with ICB.

ABSTRACT:
This study investigated whether radiomic features extracted from pretreatment [18F]FDG PET could improve the prediction of both histopathologic tumor response and survival in patients with locally advanced cervical cancer (LACC) treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery compared with conventional PET parameters and histopathologic features.Methods:The medical records of all consecutive patients with LACC referred between July 2010 and July 2016 were reviewed. [18F]FDG PET/CT was performed before neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Radiomic features were extracted from the primary tumor volumes delineated semiautomatically on the PET images and reduced by factor analysis. A receiver-operating-characteristic analysis was performed, and conventional and radiomic features were dichotomized with Liu's method according to pathologic response (pR) and cancer-specific death. According to the study protocol, only areas under the curve of more than 0.70 were selected for further analysis, including logistic regression analysis for response prediction and Cox regression analysis for survival prediction.Results:A total of 195 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. At pathologic evaluation after surgery, 131 patients (67.2%) had no or microscopic (≤3 mm) residual tumor (pR0 or pR1, respectively); 64 patients (32.8%) had macroscopic residual tumor (>3 mm, pR2). With a median follow-up of 76.0 mo (95% CI, 70.7-78.7 mo), 31.3% of patients had recurrence or progression and 20.0% died of the disease. Among conventional PET parameters, SUVmeansignificantly differed between pathologic responders and nonresponders. Among radiomic features, 1 shape and 3 textural features significantly differed between pathologic responders and nonresponders. Three radiomic features significantly differed between presence and absence of recurrence or progression and between presence and absence of cancer-specific death. Areas under the curve were less than 0.70 for all parameters; thus, univariate and multivariate regression analyses were not performed.Conclusion:In a large series of patients with LACC treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery, PET radiomic features could not predict histopathologic tumor response and survival. It is crucial to further explore the biologic mechanism underlying imaging-derived parameters and plan a large, prospective, multicenter study with standardized protocols for all phases of the process of radiomic analysis to validate radiomics before its use in clinical routine.

TITLE: Baseline 18F-FDG PET textural features as predictors of response to chemotherapy in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma

AUTHORS: Nazim Coskun, Berna Okudan, Dogan Uncu, Mehmet Tevfik Kitapci

JOURNAL: Nuclear medicine communications

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: We sought to investigate the performance of radiomics analysis on baseline 18F-FDG PET/CT for predicting response to first-line chemotherapy in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).

Material and methods: Forty-five patients who received first-line rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone (R-CHOP) chemotherapy for DLBCL were included in the study. Radiomics features and standard uptake value (SUV)-based measurements were extracted from baseline PET images for a total of 147 lesions. The selection of the most relevant features was made using the recursive feature elimination algorithm. A machine-learning model was trained using the logistic regression classifier with cross-validation to predict treatment response. The independent predictors of incomplete response were evaluated with multivariable regression analysis.

Results: A total of 14 textural features were selected by the recursive elimination algorithm, achieving a feature-to-lesion ratio of 1:10. The accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the model for predicting incomplete response were 0.87 and 0.81, respectively. Multivariable analysis revealed that SUVmax and gray level co-occurrence matrix dissimilarity were independent predictors of lesions with incomplete response to first-line R-CHOP chemotherapy.

Conclusion: Increased textural heterogeneity in baseline PET images was found to be associated with incomplete response in DLBCL.

JOURNAL: Methods (San Diego, Calif.)

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
The aim of the present review was to assess the current status of positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) radiomics research in breast cancer, and in particular to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of the published papers in order to identify challenges and suggest possible solutions and future research directions. Various combinations of the terms "breast", "radiomic", "PET", "radiomics", "texture", and "textural" were used for the literature search, extended until 8 July 2019, within the PubMed/MEDLINE database. Twenty-six articles fulfilling the inclusion/exclusion criteria were retrieved in full text and analyzed. The studies had technical and clinical objectives, including diagnosis, biological characterization (correlation with histology, molecular subtypes and IHC marker expression), prediction of response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, staging, and outcome prediction. We reviewed and discussed the selected investigations following the radiomics workflow steps related to the clinical, technical, analysis, and reporting issues. Most of the current evidence on the clinical role of PET/CT radiomics in breast cancer is at the feasibility level. Harmonized methods in image acquisition, post-processing and features calculation, predictive models and classifiers trained and validated on sufficiently representative datasets, adherence to consensus guidelines, and transparent reporting will give validity and generalizability to the results.

JOURNAL: Annals of nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Objective: This study sets out to evaluate patients with increased uptake in breast lesions on68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT (DOTA PET) and determine the clinical significance of somatostatin receptor (SSTR) positive breast lesions.

Methods: We retrospectively evaluated all patients with increased SSTR uptake in breast lesions on DOTA PET. Patients with physiological (e.g., lactation) or normal variant breast uptake (e.g., mild diffuse glandular uptake) were excluded. The maximum standard uptake value (SUVmax) was calculated using a manually drawn region of interest in the most intense uptake of breast lesions. All lesions were correlated with breast imaging, including mammography and ultrasonography. Histopathological correlation was performed if the lesion was suspicious for malignancy. Lesions were followed up radiologically (1-8 years).

Results: Out of 1573 retrospectively analyzed DOTA PET scans, the incidence of SSTR + breast lesions was measured as 1.1% (n = 18); however, 4 of 18 patients were excluded due to the lack of final diagnosis of lesions. The median age was 35 (range 14-58 years), and all patients were female. The median SUVmax of SSTR + breast lesions was 5.2 (range 1.5-12.6) for a total of 14 patients. Twelve patients had a single SSTR + breast lesion, while 2 patients had multiple SSTR + lesions on bilateral breasts. In 6 patients, single SSTR + lesions were considered as fibroadenoma; in 2 patients, multiple SSTR + lesions were considered as metastases of NET, based on correlative breast imaging. In 6 patients, histopathological confirmation was needed for the final diagnosis. Histopathologic findings confirmed fibroadenoma in 4 patients by biopsy, in 1 patient with surgical removal of the lesion. The last patient who had a history of IDC was diagnosed with a recurrence of IDC with biopsy. The median SUVmax was 5.1 (range 1.5-9.4) for malignant breast lesions and 5.4 (range 2.2-12.6) for benign breast lesions.

Conclusion: SSTR + breast lesions on DOTA PET are rarely seen in clinical practice. Uptakes of breast lesions in our cases were variable and not useful for differential diagnosis of lesions. It seems that SSTR + breast lesions should be evaluated with clinical and radiological characteristics, and correlative breast imaging and/or histopathological verification should be performed for suspicious lesions to avoid misdiagnosis.

ABSTRACT:
Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeting PET imaging is becoming the reference standard for prostate cancer staging, especially in advanced disease. Yet, the implications of PSMA PET-derived whole-body tumor volume for overall survival are poorly elucidated to date. This might be because semiautomated quantification of whole-body tumor volume as a PSMA PET biomarker is an unmet clinical challenge. Therefore, in the present study we propose and evaluate a software that enables the semiautomated quantification of PSMA PET biomarkers such as whole-body tumor volume.Methods:The proposed quantification is implemented as a research prototype. PSMA-accumulating foci were automatically segmented by a percental threshold (50% of local SUVmax). Neural networks were trained to segment organs in PET/CT acquisitions (training CTs: 8,632, validation CTs: 53). Thereby, PSMA foci within organs of physiologic PSMA uptake were semiautomatically excluded from the analysis. Pretherapeutic PSMA PET/CTs of 40 consecutive patients treated with177Lu-PSMA-617 were evaluated in this analysis. The whole-body tumor volume (PSMATV50), SUVmax, SUVmean, and other whole-body imaging biomarkers were calculated for each patient. Semiautomatically derived results were compared with manual readings in a subcohort (by 1 nuclear medicine physician). Additionally, an interobserver evaluation of the semiautomated approach was performed in a subcohort (by 2 nuclear medicine physicians).Results:Manually and semiautomatically derived PSMA metrics were highly correlated (PSMATV50:R2= 1.000,P< 0.001; SUVmax:R2= 0.988,P< 0.001). The interobserver agreement of the semiautomated workflow was also high (PSMATV50:R2= 1.000,P< 0.001, interclass correlation coefficient = 1.000; SUVmax:R2= 0.988,P< 0.001, interclass correlation coefficient = 0.997). PSMATV50(ml) was a significant predictor of overall survival (hazard ratio: 1.004; 95% confidence interval: 1.001-1.006,P= 0.002) and remained so in a multivariate regression including other biomarkers (hazard ratio: 1.004; 95% confidence interval: 1.001-1.006P= 0.004).Conclusion:PSMATV50is a promising PSMA PET biomarker that is reproducible and easily quantified by the proposed semiautomated software. Moreover, PSMATV50is a significant predictor of overall survival in patients with advanced prostate cancer who receive177Lu-PSMA-617 therapy.

TITLE: Clinical combined PET/CT radiomics model prediction of benefit from platinum-based chemotherapy and chemoradiotherapy in patients with small cell lung cancer

AUTHORS: Mengye Peng, Xinyue Yang, Yanmei Wang, Liangqin Zhou, Fan Ge, Shijia Liu, Wei Liu, Liang Cheng, Kezheng Wang

JOURNAL: Nuclear medicine communications

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Objective: To develop and validate a clinical combined radiomics model for predicting the treatment response and long-term survival prognosis of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients receiving platinum-based chemotherapy, as well as survival outcomes following chemoradiotherapy.

Methods: A total of 98 SCLC patients treated with platinum-based first-line chemotherapy were included in this study. Five prediction models for assessing the short-term efficacy of platinum-based first-line chemotherapy were developed using a logistic regression algorithm. The performance of the models was assessed by calculating the area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic curves. For predicting progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival in the platinum-based chemotherapy group and the chemoradiotherapy group, the optimal cutoff value was determined using X-tile software. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were plotted, and the log-rank test was used to compare survival outcomes.

Results: Among the five models for predicting short-term efficacy, the clinical combined positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) radiomics model performed the best, achieving areas under the curve of 0.832 and 0.833 for the training and test sets, respectively. The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis indicated that both the high-scoring Combine group and high-scoring PET/CT group were significantly associated with worse PFS and worse overall survival in the platinum-only chemotherapy group. Additionally, the high-scoring CT group was significantly associated with worse PFS in the chemoradiotherapy group.

Conclusion: The clinical combined PET/CT radiomics model can noninvasively and accurately predict the response to platinum-based treatments in SCLC as well as long-term survival prognosis, which can contribute to personalized treatment strategies and guide precision therapy for SCLC patients.

TITLE: Artificial intelligence-based, volumetric assessment of the bone marrow metabolic activity in [18F]FDG PET/CT predicts survival in multiple myeloma

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Multiple myeloma (MM) is a highly heterogeneous disease with wide variations in patient outcome. [18F]FDG PET/CT can provide prognostic information in MM, but it is hampered by issues regarding standardization of scan interpretation. Our group has recently demonstrated the feasibility of automated, volumetric assessment of bone marrow (BM) metabolic activity on PET/CT using a novel artificial intelligence (AI)-based tool. Accordingly, the aim of the current study is to investigate the prognostic role of whole-body calculations of BM metabolism in patients with newly diagnosed MM using this AI tool.

Materials and methods: Forty-four, previously untreated MM patients underwent whole-body [18F]FDG PET/CT. Automated PET/CT image segmentation and volumetric quantification of BM metabolism were based on an initial CT-based segmentation of the skeleton, its transfer to the standardized uptake value (SUV) PET images, subsequent application of different SUV thresholds, and refinement of the resulting regions using postprocessing. In the present analysis, ten different uptake thresholds (AI approaches), based on reference organs or absolute SUV values, were applied for definition of pathological tracer uptake and subsequent calculation of the whole-body metabolic tumor volume (MTV) and total lesion glycolysis (TLG). Correlation analysis was performed between the automated PET values and histopathological results of the BM as well as patients' progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to investigate the discrimination performance of MTV and TLG for prediction of 2-year PFS. The prognostic performance of the new Italian Myeloma criteria for PET Use (IMPeTUs) was also investigated.

Results: Median follow-up [95% CI] of the patient cohort was 110 months [105-123 months]. AI-based BM segmentation and calculation of MTV and TLG were feasible in all patients. A significant, positive, moderate correlation was observed between the automated quantitative whole-body PET/CT parameters, MTV and TLG, and BM plasma cell infiltration for all ten [18F]FDG uptake thresholds. With regard to PFS, univariable analysis for both MTV and TLG predicted patient outcome reasonably well for all AI approaches. Adjusting for cytogenetic abnormalities and BM plasma cell infiltration rate, multivariable analysis also showed prognostic significance for high MTV, which defined pathological [18F]FDG uptake in the BM via the liver. In terms of OS, univariable and multivariable analysis showed that whole-body MTV, again mainly using liver uptake as reference, was significantly associated with shorter survival. In line with these findings, ROC curve analysis showed that MTV and TLG, assessed using liver-based cut-offs, could predict 2-year PFS rates. The application of IMPeTUs showed that the number of focal hypermetabolic BM lesions and extramedullary disease had an adverse effect on PFS.

Conclusions: The AI-based, whole-body calculations of BM metabolism via the parameters MTV and TLG not only correlate with the degree of BM plasma cell infiltration, but also predict patient survival in MM. In particular, the parameter MTV, using the liver uptake as reference for BM segmentation, provides solid prognostic information for disease progression. In addition to highlighting the prognostic significance of automated, global volumetric estimation of metabolic tumor burden, these data open up new perspectives towards solving the complex problem of interpreting PET scans in MM with a simple, fast, and robust method that is not affected by operator-dependent interventions.

ABSTRACT:
Preclinical and clinical studies have shown that stem cells can promote the regeneration of damaged tissues, but therapeutic protocols need better quality control to confirm the location and number of transplanted cells. This study describes in vivo imaging while assessing reporter gene expression by its binding to a radiolabelled molecule to the respective receptor expressed in target cells. Five mice underwent human skeletal muscle-derived stem/progenitor cell (huSkMDS/PC EF1-HSV-TK) intracardial transplantation after induction of myocardial infarction (MI). The metabolic parameters of control and post-infarction stem progenitor cell-implanted mice were monitored using 2-deoxy-18F-fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]-FDG) before and after double promotor/reporter probe imaging with 9-(4-18F-fluoro-3-[hydroxymethyl]butyl)guanine ([18F]-FHBG) using positron emission tomography (PET) combined with computed tomography (CT). Standardized uptake values (SUVs) were then calculated based on set regions of interest (ROIs). Experimental animals were euthanized after magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Molecular [18F]-FHBG imaging of myogenic stem/progenitor cells in control and post-infarction mice confirmed the survival and proliferation of transplanted cells, as shown by an increased or stable signal from the PET apparatus throughout the 5 weeks of monitoring. huSkMDS/PC EF1-HSV-TK transplantation improved cardiac metabolic ([18F]-FDG with PET) and haemodynamic (MRI) parameters. In vivo PET/CT and MRI revealed that the precise use of a promotor/reporter probe incorporated into stem/progenitor cells may improve non-invasive monitoring of targeted cellular therapy in the cardiovascular system.

TITLE: 18F-FDG PET/CT Parameters for Predicting Prognosis in Esophageal Cancer Patients Treated With Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy

AUTHORS: Seokmo Lee, Yunseon Choi, Geumju Park, Sunmi Jo, Sun Seong Lee, Jisun Park, Hye-Kyung Shim

JOURNAL: Technology in cancer research & treatment

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Background and aims: This study evaluated the prognostic value of18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography with integrated computed tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT) performed before and after concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) in esophageal cancer.

Methods: We analyzed the prognosis of 50 non-metastatic squamous cell esophageal cancer (T1-4N0-2) patients who underwent CCRT with curative intent at Inje University Busan Paik Hospital and Haeundae Paik Hospital from 2009 to 2019. Median total radiation dose was 54 Gy (range 34-66 Gy). Our aim was to investigate the relationship between PET/CT values and prognosis. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS).

Results: The median follow-up period was 9.9 months (range 1.7-85.7). Median baseline maximum standard uptake value (SUVmax) was 14.2 (range 3.2-27.7). After treatment, 29 patients (58%) showed disease progression. The 3-year PFS and overall survival (OS) were 24.2% and 54.5%, respectively. PFS was significantly lower (P= 0.015) when SUVmax of initial PET/CT exceeded 10 (n = 22). However, OS did not reach a significant difference based on maximum SUV (P= 0.282). Small metabolic tumor volume (≤14.1) was related with good PFS (P= 0.002) and OS (P= 0.001). Small total lesion of glycolysis (≤107.3) also had a significant good prognostic effect on PFS (P= 0.009) and OS (P= 0.025). In a subgroup analysis of 18 patients with follow-up PET/CT, the patients with SUV max ≤3.5 in follow-up PET/CT showed longer PFS (P= 0.028) than those with a maximum SUV >3.5.

Conclusion: Maximum SUV of PET/CT is useful in predicting prognosis of esophageal cancer patients treated with CCRT. Efforts to find more effective treatments for patients at high risk of progression are still warranted.

TITLE: Development and validation of an 18F-FDG PET radiomic model for prognosis prediction in patients with nasal-type extranodal natural killer/T cell lymphoma

AUTHORS: Hongxi Wang, Shengnan Zhao, Li Li, Rong Tian

JOURNAL: European radiology

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Objectives: To identify an18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) radiomics-based model for predicting progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of nasal-type extranodal natural killer/T cell lymphoma (ENKTL).

Methods: In this retrospective study, a total of 110 ENKTL patients were divided into a training cohort (n = 82) and a validation cohort (n = 28). Forty-one features were extracted from pretreatment PET images of the patients. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was used to develop the radiomic signatures (R-signatures). A radiomics-based model was built and validated in the two cohorts and compared with a metabolism-based model.

Results: The R-signatures were constructed with moderate predictive ability in the training and validation cohorts (R-signaturePFS: AUC = 0.788 and 0.473; R-signatureOS: AUC = 0.637 and 0.730). For PFS, the radiomics-based model showed better discrimination than the metabolism-based model in the training cohort (C-index = 0.811 vs. 0.751) but poorer discrimination in the validation cohort (C-index = 0.588 vs. 0.693). The calibration of the radiomics-based model was poorer than that of the metabolism-based model (training cohort: p = 0.415 vs. 0.428, validation cohort: p = 0.228 vs. 0.652). For OS, the performance of the radiomics-based model was poorer (training cohort: C-index = 0.818 vs. 0.828, p = 0.853 vs. 0.885; validation cohort: C-index = 0.628 vs. 0.753, p < 0.05 vs. 0.913).

Conclusions: Radiomic features derived from PET images can predict the outcomes of patients with ENKTL, but the performance of the radiomics-based model was inferior to that of the metabolism-based model.

Key points: • The R-signatures calculated by using18F-FDG PET radiomic features can predict the survival of patients with ENKTL. • The radiomics-based models integrating the R-signatures and clinical factors achieved good predictive values. • The performance of the radiomics-based model was inferior to that of the metabolism-based model in the two cohorts.

TITLE: Texture analysis of [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography for predicting the treatment response of postoperative recurrent or metastatic oral squamous cell carcinoma treated with cetuximab

AUTHORS: Mai Kim, Wenchao Gu, Takahito Nakajima, Tetsuya Higuchi, Masaru Ogawa, Takahiro Shimizu, Takahiro Yamaguchi, Ayako Takahashi, Yoshito Tsushima, Satoshi Yokoo

JOURNAL: Annals of nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Objective: To assess the value of the texture analysis of fluorine-18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (18F-FDG-PET/CT) in predicting the treatment response of postoperative recurrent or metastatic oral squamous cell carcinoma (POR/M-OSCC) treated with cetuximab.

Methods: A total of 14 patients undergoing18F-FDG-PET/CT with POR/M-OSCC were divided into the responder and non-responder groups according to cetuximab response by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). The regions of interest (ROI) were set at the POR/M-OSCC lesions with the highest uptake of18F-FDG, and the volumetric and texture features were analyzed. The features with correlation coefficient of 0.6 or more were further evaluated using the logistic regression analysis to create a model.

Results: The SHAPEVolume(vx), SHAPEVolume(mL), metabolic tumor volume (MTV), and gray-level run-length matrix run-length nonuniformity (GLRLMRLNU) were significantly different between the responder (n = 6) and non-responder (n = 8) groups (p = 0.044, 0.042, 0.047, and 0.012, respectively). The model's area under the curve (AUC) was found to be 0.83, 0.83, 0.79, and 0.92, respectively. The heatmap with PET feature dendrogram showed four distinct clusters including them in patient's responder and non-responder groups.

Conclusions: Higher MTV, GLRLMRLNU, SHAPEVolume(vx), and SHAPEVolume(mL)in18F-FDG-PET images may have the prediction values for treatment response with POR/M-OSCC treated with cetuximab.

ABSTRACT:
Our purpose was to identify correlations between18F-fluorodihydroxyphenylalanine (18F-FDOPA) uptake and physiologic MRI, including relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), in gliomas with different molecular subtypes and to evaluate their prognostic values.Methods:Sixty-eight treatment-naïve glioma patients who underwent18F-FDOPA PET and physiologic MRI were retrospectively selected (36 with isocitrate dehydrogenase wild-type [IDHwt], 16 with mutant 1p/19q noncodeleted [IDHm-noncodel], and 16 with mutant codeleted [IDHm-codel]). Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery hyperintense areas were segmented and used as regions of interest. For voxelwise and patientwise analyses, Pearson correlation coefficients (rvoxelwiseandrpatientwise) between the normalized SUV (nSUV), rCBV, and ADC were evaluated. Cox regression analysis was performed to investigate the associations between overall survival andrvoxelwise, maximum or median nSUV, median rCBV, or median ADC.Results:For IDHwtand IDHm-noncodelgliomas, nSUV demonstrated significant positive correlations with rCBV (rvoxelwise= 0.25 and 0.31, respectively;rpatientwise= 0.50 and 0.70, respectively) and negative correlations with ADC (rvoxelwise= -0.19 and -0.19, respectively;rpatientwise= -0.58 and -0.61, respectively) in both voxelwise and patientwise analyses. IDHm-codelgliomas demonstrated a significant positive correlation between nSUV and ADC only in voxelwise analysis (rvoxelwise= 0.18). In Cox regression analysis,rvoxelwisebetween nSUV and rCBV (hazard ratio, 28.82) or ADC (hazard ratio, 0.085) had significant associations with overall survival for only IDHwtgliomas.Conclusion:IDHm-codelgliomas showed distinctive patterns of correlations between amino acid PET and physiologic MRI. Stronger correlations between nSUV and rCBV or ADC may result in a worse prognosis for IDHwtgliomas.

TITLE: Imaging CXCR4 Expression with Iodinated and Brominated Cyclam Derivatives

AUTHORS: Hanwen Zhang, Masatomo Maeda, Masahiro Shindo, Myat Ko, Mayuresh Mane, Christian Grommes, Wolfgang Weber, Ronald Blasberg

JOURNAL: Molecular imaging and biology

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: CXCR4 is one of several "chemokine" receptors expressed on malignant tumors (including GBM and PCNSL) and hematopoietic stem cells. Although68Ga-pentixafor and68Ga-NOTA-NFB have been shown to effectively image CXCR4 expression in myeloma and other systemic malignancies, imaging CXCR4 expression in brain tumors has been more limited due to the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and a considerable fraction of CXCR4 staining is intracellular.

Methods: We synthesized 6 iodinated and brominated cyclam derivatives with high affinity (low nM range) for CXCR4, since structure-based estimates of lipophilicity suggested rapid transfer across the BBB and tumor cell membranes.

Results: We tested 3 iodinated and 3 brominated cyclam derivatives in several CXCR4(+) and CXCR4(-) cell lines, with and without cold ligand blocking. To validate these novel radiolabeled cyclam derivatives for diagnostic CXCR4 imaging efficacy in brain tumors, we established appropriated murine models of intracranial GBM and PCNSL. Based on initial studies,131I-HZ262 and76Br-HZ270-1 were shown to be the most avidly accumulated radioligands.76Br-HZ270-1 was selected for further study in the U87-CXCR4 and PCNSL #15 intracranial tumor models, because of its high uptake (9.5 ± 1.3 %ID/g, SD) and low non-specific uptake (1.6 ± 0.7 %ID/g, SD) in the s.c. U87-CXCR4 tumor models. However, imaging CXCR4 expression in intracranial U87-CXCR4 and PCNSL #15 tumors with76Br-HZ270-1 was unsuccessful, following either i.v. or spinal-CSF injection.

Conclusions: Imaging CXCR4 expression with halogenated cyclam derivatives was successful in s.c. located tumors, but not in CNS located tumors. This was largely due to the following: (i) the hydrophilicity of the radiolabeled analogues-as reflected in the "measured" radiotracer distribution (LogD) in octanol/PBS-which stands in contrast to the structure-based estimate of LogP, which was the rationale for initiating the study and (ii) the presence of a modest BTB in intracranial U87-CXCR4 gliomas and an intact BBB/BTB in the intracranial PCNSL animal model.

TITLE: Prediction of lymphovascular space invasion using a combination of tenascin-C, cox-2, and PET/CT radiomics in patients with early-stage cervical squamous cell carcinoma

AUTHORS: Xiaoran Li, Chen Xu, Yang Yu, Yan Guo, Hongzan Sun

JOURNAL: BMC cancer

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Background: Lymphovascular space invasion is an independent prognostic factor in early-stage cervical cancer. However, there is a lack of non-invasive methods to detect lymphovascular space invasion. Some researchers found that Tenascin-C and Cyclooxygenase-2 was correlated with lymphovascular space invasion. Radiomics has been studied as an emerging tool for distinguishing tumor pathology stage, evaluating treatment response, and predicting prognosis. This study aimed to establish a machine learning model that combines radiomics based on PET imaging with tenascin-C (TNC) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) for predicting lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI) in patients with early-stage cervical cancer.

Methods: One hundred and twelve patients with early-stage cervical squamous cell carcinoma who underwent PET/CT examination were retrospectively analyzed. Four hundred one radiomics features based on PET/CT images were extracted and integrated into radiomics score (Rad-score). Immunohistochemical analysis was performed to evaluate TNC and COX-2 expression. Mann-Whitney U test was used to distinguish differences in the Rad-score, TNC, and COX-2 between LVSI and non-LVSI groups. The correlations of characteristics were tested by Spearman analysis. Machine learning models including radiomics model, protein model and combined model were established by logistic regression algorithm and evaluated by ROC curve. Pairwise comparisons of ROC curves were tested by DeLong test.

Results: The Rad-score of patients with LVSI was significantly higher than those without. A significant correlation was shown between LVSI and Rad-score (r = 0.631, p < 0.001). TNC was correlated to both the Rad-score (r = 0.244, p = 0.024) and COX-2 (r = 0.227, p = 0.036). The radiomics model had the best predictive performance among all models in training and external dataset (AUCs: 0.914, 0.806, respectively, p < 0.001). However, in testing dataset, the combined model had better efficiency for predicting LVSI than other models (AUCs: 0.801 vs. 0.756 and 0.801 vs. 0.631, respectively).

Conclusion: The machine learning model of the combination of PET radiomics with COX-2 and TNC provides a new tool for detecting LVSI in patients with early-stage cervical cancer. In the future, multicentric studies on larger sample of patients will be used to test the model.

Trial registration: This is a retrospective study and there is no experimental intervention on human participants. The Ethics Committee has confirmed that retrospectively registered is not required.

ABSTRACT:
Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs) may overcome endocrine resistance in estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) metastatic breast cancer. We tested whether18F-fluoroestradiol PET imaging would elucidate the pharmacodynamics of combination HDACIs and endocrine therapy.Methods:Patients with ER+/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative metastatic breast cancer with prior clinical benefit from endocrine therapy but later progression on aromatase inhibitor (AI) therapy were given vorinostat (400 mg daily) sequentially or simultaneously with AI.18F-fluoroestradiol PET and18F-FDG PET scans were performed at baseline, week 2, and week 8.Results:Eight patients were treated sequentially, and then 15 simultaneously. Eight patients had stable disease at week 8, and 6 of these 8 patients had more than 6 mo of stable disease. Higher baseline18F-fluoroestradiol uptake was associated with longer progression-free survival.18F-fluoroestradiol uptake did not systematically increase with vorinostat exposure, indicating no change in regional ER estradiol binding, and18F-FDG uptake did not show a significant decrease, as would have been expected with tumor regression.Conclusion:Simultaneous HDACIs and AI dosing in patients with cancer resistant to AI alone showed clinical benefit (6 or more months without progression) in 4 of 10 evaluable patients. Higher18F-fluoroestradiol PET uptake identified patients likely to benefit from combination therapy, but vorinostat did not change ER expression at the level of detection of18F-fluoroestradiol PET.

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Background: Cortical neurodegenerative processes may precede the emergence of disease symptoms in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) by many years. No study has evaluated the free water of patients with AD using gray matter-based spatial statistics.

Objective: The aim of this study was to explore cortical microstructural changes within the gray matter in AD by using free water imaging with gray matter-based spatial statistics.

Methods: Seventy-one participants underwent multi-shell diffusion magnetic resonance imaging, 11C-Pittsburgh compound B positron emission tomography, and neuropsychological evaluations. The patients were divided into two groups: healthy controls (n = 40) and the AD spectrum group (n = 31). Differences between the groups were analyzed using voxel-based morphometry, diffusion tensor imaging, and free water imaging with gray matter-based spatial statistics.

Results: Voxel-based morphometry analysis revealed gray matter volume loss in the hippocampus of patients with AD spectrum compared to that in controls. Furthermore, patients with AD spectrum exhibited significantly greater free water, mean diffusivity, and radial diffusivity in the limbic areas, precuneus, frontal lobe, temporal lobe, right putamen, and cerebellum than did the healthy controls. Overall, the effect sizes of free water were greater than those of mean diffusivity and radial diffusivity, and the larger effect sizes of free water were thought to be strongly correlated with AD pathology.

Conclusions: This study demonstrates the utility of applying voxel-based morphometry, gray matter-based spatial statistics, free water imaging and diffusion tensor imaging to assess AD pathology and detect changes in gray matter.

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: According to the World Health Organization classification for tumors of the central nervous system, mutation status of the isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) genes has become a major diagnostic discriminator for gliomas. Therefore, imaging-based prediction of IDH mutation status is of high interest for individual patient management. We compared and evaluated the diagnostic value of radiomics derived from dual positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data to predict the IDH mutation status non-invasively.

Methods: Eighty-seven glioma patients at initial diagnosis who underwent PET targeting the translocator protein (TSPO) using [18F]GE-180, dynamic amino acid PET using [18F]FET, and T1-/T2-weighted MRI scans were examined. In addition to calculating tumor-to-background ratio (TBR) images for all modalities, parametric images quantifying dynamic [18F]FET PET information were generated. Radiomic features were extracted from TBR and parametric images. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was employed to assess the performance of logistic regression (LR) classifiers. To report robust estimates, nested cross-validation with five folds and 50 repeats was applied.

Results: TBRGE-180features extracted from TSPO-positive volumes had the highest predictive power among TBR images (AUC 0.88, with age as co-factor 0.94). Dynamic [18F]FET PET reached a similarly high performance (0.94, with age 0.96). The highest LR coefficients in multimodal analyses included TBRGE-180features, parameters from kinetic and early static [18F]FET PET images, age, and the features from TBRT2images such as the kurtosis (0.97).

Conclusion: The findings suggest that incorporating TBRGE-180features along with kinetic information from dynamic [18F]FET PET, kurtosis from TBRT2, and age can yield very high predictability of IDH mutation status, thus potentially improving early patient management.

TITLE: Dopaminergic Nigrostriatal Connectivity in Early Parkinson Disease: In Vivo Neuroimaging Study of 11C-DTBZ PET Combined with Correlational Tractography

AUTHORS: Carlos A Sanchez-Catasus, Nicolaas I Bohnen, Fang-Cheng Yeh, Nicholas D'Cruz, Prabesh Kanel, Martijn L T M Müller

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Previous histopathologic and animal studies have shown axonal impairment and loss of connectivity of the nigrostriatal pathway in Parkinson disease (PD). However, there are conflicting reports from in vivo human studies.11C-dihydrotetrabenazine (11C-DTBZ) is a vesicular monoamine type 2 transporter PET ligand that allows assessment of nigrostriatal presynaptic dopaminergic terminal integrity. Correlational tractography based on diffusion MRI can incorporate ligand-specific information provided by11C-DTBZ PET into the fiber-tracking process. The purpose of this study was to assess the in vivo association between the integrity of the nigrostriatal tract (defined by correlational tractography) and the degree of striatal dopaminergic denervation based on11C-DTBZ PET.Methods:The study involved 30 subjects with mild to moderate PD (23 men and 7 women; mean age, 66 ± 6.2 y; disease duration, 6.4 ± 4.0 y; Hoehn and Yahr stage, 2.1 ± 0.6; Movement Disorder Society [MDS]-revised Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale [UPDRS] [I-III] total score, 43.4 ± 17.8) and 30 control subjects (18 men and 12 women; mean age, 62 ± 10.3 y).11C-DTBZ PET was performed using standard synthesis and acquisition protocols. Correlational tractography was performed to assess quantitative anisotropy (QA; a measure of tract integrity) of white matter fibers correlating with information derived from striatal11C-DTBZ data using the DSI Studio toolbox. Scans were realigned according to least and most clinically affected cerebral hemispheres.Results:Nigrostriatal tracts were identified in both hemispheres of PD patients. Higher mean QA values along the identified tracts were significantly associated with higher striatal11C-DTBZ distribution volume ratios (least affected:r= 0.57,P= 0.001; most affected:r= 0.44,P= 0.02). Lower mean QA values of the identified tract in the LA hemisphere associated with increased severity of bradykinesia sub-score derived from MDS-UPDRS part III (r= -0.42;P= 0.02). Cross-validation revealed the generalizability of these results.Conclusion:These findings suggest that impaired integrity of dopaminergic nigrostriatal nerve terminals is associated with nigrostriatal axonal dysfunction in mild to moderate PD. Assessment of nigrostriatal tract integrity may be suitable as a biomarker of early- or even prodromal-stage PD.

JOURNAL: Physical and engineering sciences in medicine

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Prostate cancer is a significant global health issue due to its high incidence and poor outcomes in metastatic disease. This study aims to develop models predicting overall survival for patients with metastatic biochemically recurrent prostate cancer, potentially helping to identify high-risk patients and enabling more tailored treatment options. A multi-centre cohort of 180 such patients underwent [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT scans, with lesions semi-automatically segmented and radiomic features extracted from lesions. The analysis included two phases: univariable and multivariable. Univariable analysis used Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards models to correlate individual features with overall survival. Multivariable analysis used the LASSO Cox proportional hazards method to create 13 models: radiomics-only, clinical-only, and various combinations of radiomic and clinical features. Each model included six features and was bootstrapped 1000 times to obtain concordance indices with 95% confidence intervals, followed by optimism correction. In the univariable analysis, 6 out of 8 clinical features and 68 out of 89 radiomic features were significantly correlated with overall survival, including age, disease stage, total lesional uptake and total lesional volume. The optimism-corrected concordance indices from the multivariable models were 0.722 (95% CI 0.653-0.784) for the clinical model, 0.681 (95% CI 0.616-0.745) for the radiomics model, and 0.704 (95% CI 0.648-0.768) for the combined model with three clinical and three radiomic features, when extracting radiomic features from the largest lesion only. While univariable analysis showed significant prognostic value for many radiomic features, their integration into multivariable models did not improve predictive accuracy beyond clinical features alone.

ABSTRACT:
177Lu-PSMA therapy is an effective treatment in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. SUVmeanis a valuable screening biomarker to assess the suitability for177Lu-PSMA therapy but requires quantitative software. This study aims to develop a simple, clinically applicable prostate-specific membrane antigen PET/CT score that encompasses the elements of SUVmeanwithout requiring additional quantification.Methods:Datasets from ethics-approved trials of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer after androgen receptor signaling inhibition and taxane chemotherapy (or unfit for taxane), who were treated with177Lu-PSMA-617 and177Lu-PSMA I&T with a pretreatment screening with68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT, and clinical outcome data, including a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) 50% response rate (PSA50), PSA progression-free survival (PSA-PFS), and overall survival (OS), were included. The screening68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT of all participants was analyzed both semiquantitatively and visually. Semiquantitative analysis was used to derive the SUVmeanVisual analysis of the68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT images involved a binary visual heterogeneity assessment (homogeneous or heterogeneous), allocating a tumor SUVmaxrange (<15, 15-29, 30-49, 50-79, or ≥80). A 4-category score incorporating both heterogeneity and intensity of tumors (HIT) was then developed as a combination of heterogeneity and intensity (SUVmaxrange). The SUVmaxwas less than 15 for score 1, 15-79 with heterogeneous intensity for score 2, 15-79 with homogeneous intensity for score 3, and 80 or greater for score 4. This score was evaluated according to clinical outcomes (PSA50, PSA-PFS, and OS) and compared with SUVmeanResults:Data from 139 participants were analyzed. In total, 75 (54%) patients achieved a PSA50 with a median PSA-PFS of 5.5 mo (95% CI, 4.1-6.0 mo) and an OS of 13.5 mo (95% CI, 11.1-17.9 mo). SUVmeanwas associated with PSA50 and survival outcomes when analyzed as a continuous variable or as quartiles. The PSA50 for HIT scores 1-4 was 0%, 39%, 65%, and 76%, respectively. The HIT score was strongly related to PSA-PFS and OS (log-rank test,P< 0.001 andP= 0.002). The median PSA-PFS for HIT scores 1-4 was 1.0, 4.1, 6.0, and 8.5, respectively, and the median OS was 7.6, 12.0, 18.5, and 16.9 mo, respectively. Cohen κ between readers for the HIT score was 0.71.Conclusion:A prostate-specific membrane antigen PET/CT score incorporating HIT derived from tools on a standard PET workstation is comparable with quantitative SUVmeanas a prognostic tool following177Lu-PSMA therapy.

TITLE: 11C-acetate positron emission tomography is more precise than 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography in evaluating tumor burden and predicting disease risk of multiple myeloma

AUTHORS: Miao Chen, Wenjia Zhu, Jianhua Du, Chen Yang, Bing Han, Daobin Zhou, Li Huo, Junling Zhuang

JOURNAL: Scientific reports

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
The optimal method of tumor burden evaluation in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) is yet to be determined. This study aimed to compare the value of11C-acetate positron-emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) (AC-PET and18F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT (FDG-PET) in the assessment of tumor burden in NDMM. This study evaluated 64 NDMM patients between February 2015 and July 2018. AC-PET and FDG-PET were used to assess myeloma lesions. The clinical data, imaging results, and their correlations were analyzed. Diffuse bone marrow uptake in AC-PET was significantly correlated with biomarkers for tumor burden, including serum hemoglobin (P = 0.020), M protein (P = 0.054), the percentage of bone marrow plasma cells (P < 0.001), and the Durie-Salmon stage of the disease (P = 0.007). The maximum standard uptake value (SUVmax) of focal lesions and high diffuse bone marrow uptake in AC-PET showed stronger correlations with high-risk disease (P = 0.017, P = 0.013) than those in FDG-PET. Moreover, the presence of diffuse bone marrow uptake, more than ten focal lesions, and an SUVmaxof focal lesions of > 6.0 in AC-PET, but not in FDG-PET, predicted a higher probability of disease progression and shorter progression-free survival (P < 0.05). AC-PET outperformed FDG-PET in tumor burden evaluation and disease progression prediction in NDMM.

TITLE: Texture Analysis Improves the Value of Pretreatment 18F-FDG PET/CT in Predicting Interim Response of Primary Gastrointestinal Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma

AUTHORS: Yiwen Sun, Xiangmei Qiao, Chong Jiang, Song Liu, Zhengyang Zhou

JOURNAL: Contrast media & molecular imaging

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Objectives: To explore the application of pretreatment18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) texture analysis (TA) in predicting the interim response of primary gastrointestinal diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (PGIL-DLBCL).

Methods: Pretreatment18F-FDG PET/CT images of 30 PGIL-DLBCL patients were studied retrospectively. The interim response was evaluated after 3-4 cycles of chemotherapy. The complete response (CR) rates in patients with different clinicopathological characteristics were compared by Fisher's exact test. The differences in the maximum standard uptake value (SUVmax), metabolic tumor volume (MTV), and texture features between the CR and non-CR groups were compared by the Mann-WhitneyUtest. Feature selection was performed according to the results of the Mann-WhitneyUtest and feature categories. The predictive efficacies of the SUVmax, MTV, and the selected texture features were assessed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. A prediction probability was generated by binary logistic regression analysis.

Results: The SUVmax, MTV, some first-order texture features, volume, and entropy were significantly higher in the non-CR group. The energy was significantly lower in the non-CR group. The SUVmax, volume, and entropy were excellent predictors of the interim response, and the areas under the curves (AUCs) were 0.850, 0.805, and 0.800, respectively. The CR rate was significantly lower in patients with intestinal involvement. The prediction probability generated from the combination of the SUVmax, entropy, volume, and intestinal involvement had a higher AUC (0.915) than all single parameters.

Conclusions: TA has potential in improving the value of pretreatment PET/CT in predicting the interim response of PGIL-DLBCL. However, prospective studies with large sample sizes and validation analyses are needed to confirm the current results.

JOURNAL: Stroke

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Background and purpose: High-risk atherosclerosis is an underlying cause of cardiovascular events, yet identifying the specific patient population at immediate risk is still challenging. Here, we used a rabbit model of atherosclerotic plaque rupture and human carotid endarterectomy specimens to describe the potential of molecular fibrin imaging as a tool to identify thrombotic plaques.

Methods: Atherosclerotic plaques in rabbits were induced using a high-cholesterol diet and aortic balloon injury (N=13). Pharmacological triggering was used in a group of rabbits (n=9) to induce plaque disruption. Animals were grouped into thrombotic and nonthrombotic plaque groups based on gross pathology (gold standard). All animals were injected with a novel fibrin-specific probe68Ga-CM246 followed by positron emission tomography (PET)/magnetic resonance imaging 90 minutes later.68Ga-CM246 was quantified on the PET images using tissue-to-background (back muscle) ratios and standardized uptake value.

Results: Both tissue-to-background (back muscle) ratios and standardized uptake value were significantly higher in the thrombotic versus nonthrombotic group (P<0.05). Ex vivo PET and autoradiography of the abdominal aorta correlated positively with in vivo PET measurements. Plaque disruption identified by68Ga-CM246 PET agreed with gross pathology assessment (85%). In ex vivo surgical specimens obtained from patients undergoing elective carotid endarterectomy (N=12),68Ga-CM246 showed significantly higher binding to carotid plaques compared to a D-cysteine nonbinding control probe.

Conclusions: We demonstrated that molecular fibrin PET imaging using68Ga-CM246 could be a useful tool to diagnose experimental and clinical atherothrombosis. Based on our initial results using human carotid plaque specimens, in vivo molecular imaging studies are warranted to test68Ga-CM246 PET as a tool to stratify risk in atherosclerotic patients.

TITLE: Histology-Based Radiomics for [18F]FDG PET Identifies Tissue Heterogeneity in Pancreatic Cancer

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Radiomics features can reveal hidden patterns in a tumor but usually lack an underlying biologic rationale. In this work, we aimed to investigate whether there is a correlation between radiomics features extracted from [18F]FDG PET images and histologic expression patterns of a glycolytic marker, monocarboxylate transporter-4 (MCT4), in pancreatic cancer.Methods:A cohort of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma patients (n= 29) for whom both tumor cross sections and [18F]FDG PET/CT scans were available was used to develop an [18F]FDG PET radiomics signature. By using immunohistochemistry for MCT4, we computed density maps of MCT4 expression and extracted pathomics features. Cluster analysis identified 2 subgroups with distinct MCT4 expression patterns. From corresponding [18F]FDG PET scans, radiomics features that associate with the predefined MCT4 subgroups were identified.Results:Complex heat map visualization showed that the MCT4-high/heterogeneous subgroup was correlating with a higher MCT4 expression level and local variation. This pattern linked to a specific [18F]FDG PET signature, characterized by a higher SUVmeanand SUVmaxand second-order radiomics features, correlating with local variation. This MCT4-based [18F]FDG PET signature of 7 radiomics features demonstrated prognostic value in an independent cohort of pancreatic cancer patients (n= 71) and identified patients with worse survival.Conclusion:Our cross-modal pipeline allows the development of PET scan signatures based on immunohistochemical analysis of markers of a particular biologic feature, here demonstrated on pancreatic cancer using intratumoral MCT4 expression levels to select [18F]FDG PET radiomics features. This study demonstrated the potential of radiomics scores to noninvasively capture intratumoral marker heterogeneity and identify a subset of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma patients with a poor prognosis.

TITLE: Could the skewness and kurtosis texture parameters of lesions obtained from pretreatment Ga-68 DOTA-TATE PET/CT images predict receptor radionuclide therapy response in patients with gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors?

AUTHORS: Hasan Önner, Ümmühan Abdülrezzak, Ahmet Tutuş

JOURNAL: Nuclear medicine communications

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: In our study, tumor heterogeneity was evaluated using the parameters skewness and kurtosis on pretreatment Ga-68 DOTA-TATE PET/CT to assess therapy responses of lesions in patients with gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP NETs) treated with peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT).

Method: We retrospectively studied the texture analysis with relatively simple first-order parameters skewness and kurtosis on pretreatment Ga-68 DOTA-TATE PET/CT from 22 patients (eight females, 14 males; with a mean age: 54 ± 11 years) with GEP NETs who were treated with 2-6 therapy cycles of Lu-177 DOTA-TATE. A total of 326 lesions of 22 patients were evaluated in terms of treatment response by Ga-68 DOTA-TATE PET/CT examination performed before and after treatment. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated to assess skewness and kurtosis to discriminate between responder and nonresponder lesions.

Result: A total of 326 lesions of 22 patients were evaluated and 137 lesions responded partially or completely to the treatment, 189 lesions did not respond to treatment, remained stable or progressed. The skewness and kurtosis values of the lesions which did not respond to the PRRT were significantly higher than those with response to PRRT treatment (P < 0.001 and P = 0.004, respectively). However, ROC curves provided a moderate area under the curve value for skewness and a relatively low value for kurtosis (0.619 and 0.518, respectively).

Conclusion: Texture analysis using skewness and kurtosis of the lesions on pretreatment Ga-68 DOTA-TATE PET/CT was able to predict their responsiveness to PRRT.

JOURNAL: Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Introduction: A key goal of the Alzheimer's Disease NeuroImaging Initiative (ADNI) positron emission tomography (PET) Core is to harmonize quantification of β-amyloid (Aβ) and tau PET image data across multiple scanners and tracers.

Methods: We developed an analysis pipeline (Berkeley PET Imaging Pipeline, B-PIP) for ADNI Aβ and tau PET images and applied it to PET data from other multisite studies. Steps include image pre-processing, refacing, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)/PET co-registration, visual quality control (QC), quantification of tracer uptake, and standardization of Aβ and tau standardized uptake value ratios (SUVrs) across tracers.

Results: Measurements from 10,105 cross-sectional and longitudinal Aβ and tau PET scans acquired in several studies between 2010 and 2024 can be processed, harmonized, and directly merged across tracers and cohorts.

Discussion: The B-PIP developed in ADNI is a scalable image harmonization approach used in several observational studies and clinical trials that facilitates rigorous Aβ and tau PET quantification and data sharing.

Highlights: Quantitative results from ADNI Aβ and tau PET data are generated using a rigorous, scalable image processing pipeline This pipeline has been applied to PET data from several other large, multisite studies and trials Quantitative outcomes are harmonizable across studies and are shared with the scientific community.

TITLE: PET amyloid in normal aging: direct comparison of visual and automatic processing methods

AUTHORS: Sven Haller, Marie-Louise Montandon, Johan Lilja, Cristelle Rodriguez, Valentina Garibotto, François R Herrmann, Panteleimon Giannakopoulos

JOURNAL: Scientific reports

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Assessment of amyloid deposits is a critical step for the identification of Alzheimer disease (AD) signature in asymptomatic elders. Whether the different amyloid processing methods impacts on the quality of clinico-radiological correlations is still unclear. We directly compared in 155 elderly controls with extensive neuropsychological testing at baseline and 4.5 years follow-up three approaches: (i) operator-dependent standard visual reading, (ii) operator-independent automatic SUVR with four different reference regions, and (iii) novel operator and region of reference-independent automatic Aβ-index. The coefficient of variance was used to examine inter-individual variability for each processing method. Using visually-established amyloid positivity as the gold standard, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) was computed. Linear regression models were used to assess the association between changes in continuous cognitive score and amyloid uptake values. In SUVR analyses, the coefficient of variance varied from 1.718 to 1.762 according to the area of reference and was of - 3.045 for the Aβ-index method. Compared to the visual rating, Aβ-index method showed the largest area under the ROC curve [0.9568 (95% CI 0.9252, 0.98833)]. The best cut-off score was of - 0.3359 with sensitivity and specificity values of 0.97 and 0.83, respectively. Only the Aß-index was related to more severe decrement of cognitive performances [regression coefficient: 9.103 (95% CI 1.148, 17.058)]. The Aβ-index is considered as preferred option in asymptomatic elders, since it is operator-independent, avoids the selection of reference area, is closer to established visual scoring and correlates with the evolution of cognitive performances.

TITLE: PET: Parameter-efficient Knowledge Distillation on Transformer

AUTHORS: Hyojin Jeon, Seungcheol Park, Jin-Gee Kim, U Kang

JOURNAL: PloS one

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Given a large Transformer model, how can we obtain a small and computationally efficient model which maintains the performance of the original model? Transformer has shown significant performance improvements for many NLP tasks in recent years. However, their large size, expensive computational cost, and long inference time make it challenging to deploy them to resource-constrained devices. Existing Transformer compression methods mainly focus on reducing the size of the encoder ignoring the fact that the decoder takes the major portion of the long inference time. In this paper, we propose PET (Parameter-Efficient knowledge distillation on Transformer), an efficient Transformer compression method that reduces the size of both the encoder and decoder. In PET, we identify and exploit pairs of parameter groups for efficient weight sharing, and employ a warm-up process using a simplified task to increase the gain through Knowledge Distillation. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets show that PET outperforms existing methods in machine translation tasks. Specifically, on the IWSLT'14 EN→DE task, PET reduces the memory usage by 81.20% and accelerates the inference speed by 45.15% compared to the uncompressed model, with a minor decrease in BLEU score of 0.27.

TITLE: Associations of physiologic myocardial 18F-FDG uptake with fasting duration, HbA1c, and regular exercise

AUTHORS: Ji Yeon Kang, Mi-Yeon Lee, Young-Hwan Kim

JOURNAL: Annals of nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Objective: The variability of physiologic18F-FDG uptake in the myocardium has hampered the accurate evaluation of cardiac glucose metabolism. We investigated the effects of multiple factors, including fasting duration and physical activity, on the physiologic uptake of18F-FDG by the myocardium in healthy participants.

Methods: A total of 446 participants (predominantly male, 91%) in a health screening program were included in this retrospective study. For the visual analysis of myocardial18F-FDG uptake, the participants were categorized into three groups according to qualitative visual scales (QVS). For the quantitative analysis, the maximum SUV of the left ventricular myocardium was measured.

Results: Significant differences were observed in fasting duration (p < 0.001), SUVmax(p < 0.001), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (p < 0.001), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (p < 0.001), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (γ-GTP) (p = 0.001), and uric acid (p = 0.015) among the QVS groups. Participants who regularly exercised with vigorous activity (p = 0.032) and HbA1c > 6% (p = 0.005) showed significant association with myocardial FDG uptake in the Chi-squared test. The median value of fasting duration decreased significantly as the QVS of the myocardium increased. Twenty-nine of the 31 participants (93.5%) who fasted for 21.5 h or more showed a suppressed FDG uptake (mean SUVmax= 2.1). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, fasting duration (OR = 0.74, 95% CI 0.69-0.80, p < 0.001), HbA1c > 6% (OR = 0.29, 95% CI: 0.12 - 0.66, p = 0.004), uric acid (OR = 0.82, 95% CI 0.68-1.00, p = 0.049) and regular exercise with vigorous activity (OR = 1.75, 95% CI 1.13-2.70, p = 0.012) were significant factors for physiologic myocardial FDG uptake.

Conclusions: Reduced physiologic18F-FDG uptake of the myocardium was associated with longer fasting duration, higher level of HbA1c, and less frequency of regular exercise with vigorous activity. For the preparation of cardiac18F-FDG PET, inclusion of longer fasting duration (more than 18 h) might be necessary for the adequate suppression of physiologic18F-FDG myocardial uptake.

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Introduction: Relationships between brain atrophy patterns of typical aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD), white matter disease, cognition, and AD neuropathology were investigated via machine learning in a large harmonized magnetic resonance imaging database (11 studies; 10,216 subjects).

Methods: Three brain signatures were calculated: Brain-age, AD-like neurodegeneration, and white matter hyperintensities (WMHs). Brain Charts measured and displayed the relationships of these signatures to cognition and molecular biomarkers of AD.

Results: WMHs were associated with advanced brain aging, AD-like atrophy, poorer cognition, and AD neuropathology in mild cognitive impairment (MCI)/AD and cognitively normal (CN) subjects. High WMH volume was associated with brain aging and cognitive decline occurring in an ≈10-year period in CN subjects. WMHs were associated with doubling the likelihood of amyloid beta (Aβ) positivity after age 65. Brain aging, AD-like atrophy, and WMHs were better predictors of cognition than chronological age in MCI/AD.

Discussion: A Brain Chart quantifying brain-aging trajectories was established, enabling the systematic evaluation of individuals' brain-aging patterns relative to this large consortium.

JOURNAL: Annals of nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Objectives: The aim of this study was to assess the clinical value of [11C]4DST uptake in patients with lung nodules, including benign and malignant tumors, and to assess the correlation between [11C]4DST uptake and proliferative activity of tumors in comparison with [18F]FDG uptake.

Methods: Twenty-six patients (22 males and 4 females, mean age of 65.5-year-old) were analyzed in this prospective study. Patients underwent [11C]4DST and [18F]FDG PET/CT imaging on the same day. Diagnosis of each lung nodule was confirmed by histopathological examination of tissue specimens at surgery, or during clinical follow-up after the PET/CT studies. To assess the utility of the semi-quantitative evaluation method, the SUVmaxwas calculated of [11C]4DST and [18F]FDG uptake by the lesion. Proliferative activities of each tumor as indicated by the immunohistochemical Ki-67 index was also estimated using surgical specimens of patients. Then the relationship between the SUVmaxof both PET/CT and the Ki-67 index was examined. Furthermore, the relationship between the uptake of [11C]4DST or [18F]FDG and the histopathological findings, the clinical stage, and the clinical outcome of patients were also assessed.

Results: There was a positive linear relationship between the SUVmaxof [11C]4DST images and the Ki-67 index (Correlation coefficients = 0.68). The SUVmaxof [11C]4DST in the 26 lung nodules were 1.65 ± 0.40 for benign lesions, 3.09 ± 0.83 for adenocarcinomas (P < 0.001 between benign and adenocarcinoma), and 2.92 ± 0.58 for SqCCs (P < 0.001 between benign and SqCC). Whereas, the SUVmax of [18F]FDG were 2.38 ± 2.27 for benign lesions, 6.63 ± 4.24 for adenocarcinomas (n.s.), and 7.52 ± 2.84 for SqCCs (n.s.). The relationship between TNM tumor stage and the SUVmaxof [11C]4DST were 2.54 ± 0.37 for T1, 3.48 ± 0.57 for T2, and 4.17 ± 0.72 for T3 (P < 0.005 between T1 and T2, and P < 0.001 between T1 and T3). In comparison with the TNM pathological stage, SUVmax of [11C]4DST were 2.63 ± 0.49 for stage I, 3.36 ± 0.23 for stage II, 3.40 ± 1.12 for stage III, and 4.65 for stage IV (P < 0.05 between stages I and II). In comparison of the clinical outcome, the SUVmaxof [11C]4DST were 2.72 ± 0.56 for the no recurrence (No Rec.) group, 3.10 ± 0.33 for the recurrence-free with adjuvant chemotherapy after the surgery (the No Rec. Adjv. CTx. group) and 4.66 ± 0.02 for the recurrence group (Rec. group) (P < 0.001 between the No Rec and Rec. groups, and P < 0.005 between the No Rec. Adjv. CTx. and Rec. groups).

Conclusions: PET/CT with [11C]4DST is as feasible for imaging of lung tumors as [18F]FDG PET/CT. For diagnosing lung tumors, [11C]4DST PET is useful in distinguishing benign nodules from malignancies. [11C]4DST uptake in lung carcinomas is correlated with the proliferative activity of tumors, indicating a promising noninvasive PET imaging of DNA synthesis in malignant lung tumors.

TITLE: A practical method for multimodal registration and assessment of whole-brain disease burden using PET, MRI, and optical imaging

AUTHORS: Matthew L Scarpelli, Debbie R Healey, Shwetal Mehta, Vikram D Kodibagkar, Christopher C Quarles

JOURNAL: Scientific reports

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Many neurological diseases present with substantial genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity, making assessment of these diseases challenging. This has led to ineffective treatments, significant morbidity, and high mortality rates for patients with neurological diseases, including brain cancers and neurodegenerative disorders. Improved understanding of this heterogeneity is necessary if more effective treatments are to be developed. We describe a new method to measure phenotypic heterogeneity across the whole rodent brain at multiple spatial scales. The method involves co-registration and localized comparison of in vivo radiologic images (e.g. MRI, PET) with ex vivo optical reporter images (e.g. labeled cells, molecular targets, microvasculature) of optically cleared tissue slices. Ex vivo fluorescent images of optically cleared pathology slices are acquired with a preclinical in vivo optical imaging system across the entire rodent brain in under five minutes, making this methodology practical and feasible for most preclinical imaging labs. The methodology is applied in various examples demonstrating how it might be used to cross-validate and compare in vivo radiologic imaging with ex vivo optical imaging techniques for assessing hypoxia, microvasculature, and tumor growth.

ABSTRACT:
Recently, a18F-labeled derivative of the widely used68Ga-PSMA-11 was developed for PET imaging of prostate cancer. Although18F-PSMA-11 has already been evaluated in a Phase I and Phase II clinical trial, preclinical evaluation of this radiotracer is important for further understanding its dynamic behavior. Saturation binding experiments were conducted by incubation of LNCaP cells with18F-PSMA-11 or68Ga-PSMA-11 for 1 h, followed by determination of the specific and aspecific binding. Mice bearing LNCaP or PC-3 xenografts each received ± 3.7 MBq18F-PSMA-11 and68Ga-PSMA-11 followed by dynamic acquisition of 2.5 h as well as ± 15 MBq18F-FDG followed by static acquisition at 1 h post injection (p.i.). Uptake was evaluated by comparison of uptake parameters (SUVmean, SUVmax, TBRmeanand TBRmax). Mice underwent ex vivo biodistribution where18F-PSMA-11 activity was measures in excretory organs (kidneys, bladder and liver) as well as bone fragments (femur, humerus, sternum and skull) to evaluate bone uptake. The dissociation constant (Kd) of18F-PSMA-11 and68Ga-PSMA-11 was 2.95 ± 0.87 nM and 0.49 ± 0.20 nM, respectively. Uptake parameters were significantly higher in LNCaP compared to PC-3 xenografts for both18F-PSMA-11 and68Ga-PSMA-11, while no difference was found for18F-FDG uptake (except for SUVmax). Tumor uptake of18F-PSMA-11 showed a similar trend over time as68Ga-PSMA-11, although all uptake parameter curves of the latter were considerably lower. When comparing early (60 min p.i.) to delayed (150 min p.i.) imaging for both radiotracers individually, TBRmeanand TBRmaxwere significantly higher at the later timepoint, as well as the SUVmaxof68Ga-PSMA-11. The highest %ID/g was determined in the kidneys (94.0 ± 13.6%ID/g 1 h p.i.) and the bladder (6.48 ± 2.18%ID/g 1 h p.i.). No significant increase in bone uptake was seen between 1 and 2 h p.i. Both radiotracers showed high affinity for the PSMA receptor. Over time, all uptake parameters were higher for18F-PSMA-11 compared to68Ga-PSMA-11. Delayed imaging with the latter may improve tumor visualization, while no additional benefits could be found for late18F-PSMA-11 imaging. Ex vivo biodistribution demonstrated fast renal clearance of18F-PSMA-11 as well as no significant increase in bone uptake.

ABSTRACT:
Mitochondrial complex I (MC-I) is an essential regulator of brain bioenergetics and can be quantified in the brain using PET radioligand18F-BCPP-EF. Here we evaluate the test-retest reproducibility of18F-BCPP-EF in humans, and assess the use of a non-invasive quantification method (standardised uptake value ratio - SUVR). Thirty healthy volunteers had a 90-min dynamic18F-BCPP-EF scan with arterial blood sampling, five of which received a second scan to be included in the test-retest analysis. Time-activity curves (TAC) were analysed using multilinear analysis 1 (MA1) and the two-tissue compartment model (2TC) to estimate volumes of distribution (VT). Regional SUVR-1 values were calculated from the 70 to 90-min TAC data using the centrum semiovale as a pseudo reference region, and compared to kinetic analysis-derived outcome measures. The mean absolute test-retest variability of VTranged from 12% to 18% across regions. Both DVR-1and SUVR-1 had improved test-retest variability in the range 2%-7%. SUVR-1 was highly correlated with DVR-1 (r2= 0.97,n= 30). In conclusion,18F-BCPP-EF has suitable test-retest reproducibility and can be used to quantify MC-I in clinical studies.

JOURNAL: BMC cancer

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Background: This study aimed to assess the utility of deep learning analysis using pretreatment FDG-PET images to predict local treatment outcome in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) patients.

Methods: One hundred fifty-four OPSCC patients who received pretreatment FDG-PET were included and divided into training (n = 102) and test (n = 52) sets. The diagnosis of local failure and local progression-free survival (PFS) rates were obtained from patient medical records. In deep learning analyses, axial and coronal images were assessed by three different architectures (AlexNet, GoogLeNET, and ResNet). In the training set, FDG-PET images were analyzed after the data augmentation process for the diagnostic model creation. A multivariate clinical model was also created using a binomial logistic regression model from a patient's clinical characteristics. The test data set was subsequently analyzed for confirmation of diagnostic accuracy. Assessment of local PFS rates was also performed.

Results: Training sessions were successfully performed with an accuracy of 74-89%. ROC curve analyses revealed an AUC of 0.61-0.85 by the deep learning model in the test set, whereas it was 0.62 by T-stage, 0.59 by clinical stage, and 0.74 by a multivariate clinical model. The highest AUC (0.85) was obtained with deep learning analysis of ResNet architecture. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis revealed deep learning-based classification by a multivariate clinical model (P < .05), and ResNet (P < .001) was a significant predictor of the treatment outcome. In the Kaplan-Meier analysis, the deep learning-based classification divided the patient's local PFS rate better than the T-stage, clinical stage, and a multivariate clinical model.

Conclusions: Deep learning-based diagnostic model with FDG-PET images indicated its possibility to predict local treatment outcomes in OPSCCs.

TITLE: Optical scattering as an early marker of apoptosis during chemotherapy and antiangiogenic therapy in murine models of prostate and breast cancer

AUTHORS: Syeda Tabassum, Anup Tank, Fay Wang, Kavon Karrobi, Cameron Vergato, Irving J Bigio, David J Waxman, Darren Roblyer

JOURNAL: Neoplasia (New York, N.Y.)

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Monitoring of the in vivo tumor state to track therapeutic response in real time may help to evaluate new drug candidates, maximize treatment efficacy, and reduce the burden of overtreatment. Current preclinical tumor imaging methods have largely focused on anatomic imaging (e.g., MRI, ultrasound), functional imaging (e.g., FDG-PET), and molecular imaging with exogenous contrast agents (e.g., fluorescence optical tomography). Here we utalize spatial frequency domain imaging (SFDI), a noninvasive, label-free optical technique, for the wide-field quantification of changes in tissue optical scattering in preclinical tumor models during treatment with chemotherapy and antiangiogenic agents. Optical scattering is particularly sensitive to tissue micro-architectural changes, including those that occur during apoptosis, an early indicator of response to cytotoxicity induced by chemotherapy, thermotherapy, cryotherapy, or radiation therapy. We utilized SFDI to monitor responses of PC3/2G7 prostate tumors and E0771 mammary tumors to treatment with cyclophosphamide or the antiangiogenic agent DC101 for up to 49 days. The SFDI-derived scattering amplitude was highly correlated with cleaved caspase-3, a marker of apoptosis (ρp= 0.75), while the exponent of the scattering wavelength-dependence correlated with the cell proliferation marker PCNA (ρp= 0.69). These optical parameters outperformed tumor volume and several functional parameters (e.g., oxygen saturation and hemoglobin concentration) as an early predictive biomarker of treatment response. Quantitative diffuse optical scattering is thus a promising new early marker of treatment response, which does not require radiation or exogenous contrast agents.

TITLE: Non-rigid Multi-Modal Medical Image Registration Based on Improved Maximum Mutual Information PV Image Interpolation Method

AUTHORS: Liting He

JOURNAL: Frontiers in public health

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
With the continuous improvement of medical imaging equipment, CT, MRI and PET images can obtain accurate anatomical information of the same patient site. However, due to the fuzziness of medical image physiological evaluation and the unhealthy understanding of objects, the registration effect of many methods is not ideal. Therefore, based on the medical image registration model of Partial Volume (PV) image interpolation method and rigid medical image registration method, this paper established the non-rigid registration model of maximum mutual information Novel Partial Volume (NPV) image interpolation method. The proposed NPV interpolation method uses the Davidon-Fletcher-Powell algorithm (DFP) algorithm optimization method to solve the transformation parameter matrix and realize the accurate transformation of the floating image. In addition, the cubic B-spline is used as the kernel function to improve the image interpolation, which effectively improves the accuracy of the registration image. Finally, the proposed NPV method is compared with the PV interpolation method through the human brain CT-MRI-PET image to obtain a clear CT-MRI-PET image. The results show that the proposed NPV method has higher accuracy, better robustness, and easier realization. The model should also have guiding significance in face recognition and fingerprint recognition.

ABSTRACT:
Simultaneous PET-MR imaging has shown potential for the comprehensive assessment of myocardial health from a single examination. Furthermore, MR-derived respiratory motion information has been shown to improve PET image quality by incorporating this information into the PET image reconstruction. Separately, MR-based anatomically guided PET image reconstruction has been shown to perform effective denoising, but this has been so far demonstrated mainly in brain imaging. To date the combined benefits of motion compensation and anatomical guidance have not been demonstrated for myocardial PET-MR imaging. This work addresses this by proposing a single cardiac PET-MR image reconstruction framework which fully utilises MR-derived information to allow both motion compensation and anatomical guidance within the reconstruction.Methods:Fifteen patients underwent a18F-FDG cardiac PET-MR scan with a previously introduced acquisition framework. The MR data processing and image reconstruction pipeline produces respiratory motion fields and a high-resolution respiratory motion-corrected MR image with good tissue contrast. This MR-derived information was then included in a respiratory motion-corrected, cardiac-gated, anatomically guided image reconstruction of the simultaneously acquired PET data. Reconstructions were evaluated by measuring myocardial contrast and noise and compared to images from several comparative intermediate methods using the components of the proposed framework separately.Results:Including respiratory motion correction, cardiac gating, and anatomical guidance significantly increased contrast. In particular, myocardium-to-blood pool contrast increased by 143% on average (p<0.0001) compared to conventional uncorrected, non-guided PET images. Furthermore, anatomical guidance significantly reduced image noise compared to non-guided image reconstruction by 16.1% (p<0.0001).Conclusion:The proposed framework for MR-derived motion compensation and anatomical guidance of cardiac PET data was shown to significantly improve image quality compared to alternative reconstruction methods. Each component of the reconstruction pipeline was shown to have a positive impact on the final image quality. These improvements have the potential to improve clinical interpretability and diagnosis based on cardiac PET-MR images.

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: We aimed to find metabolic, functional or morphological characteristics of the tumor predicting failure to achieve complete metabolic remission (CMR) by the midtreatment PET/MRI (positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging) in cervical cancer patients.

Methods: We evaluated 66 patients treated between August 2015 and November 2019 who underwent pretreatment staging, subsequent midtreatment evaluation, and definitive restaging 3 months after completing the whole treatment, all using PET/MRI. The pretreatment parameters (pre-SUVmax, pre-SUVmean, pre-MTV, pre-MTV‑S, pre-TLG, pre-TLG‑S [SUV: standard uptake value, MTV: metabolic tumor volume, TLG: total lesion glycolysis]), and the midtreatment parameters at week 5 during chemoradiotherapy (mid-SUVmax, mid-SUVmean, mid-MTV, mid-MTV‑S, mid-TLG and mid-TLG-S) were recorded. The value of ADC (apparent diffusion coefficient) was also measured. Furthermore, we recorded absolute and relative changes in all parameters-∆ and ∆%. We divided the whole group of patients into "responders" (CMR) and "non-responders" (non-CMR), and compared them on the basis of the parameters from pre-PET/MRI and mid-PET/MRI.

Results: A statistically significant difference in the evaluated parameters between responders and non-responders was found for the following parameters: mid-MTV, mid-TLG, mid-TLG‑S, mid-MTV‑S, mid-tumor size, and ∆%SUVmax. According to the ROC (receiver operating characteristic) analysis, mid-MTV‑S showed the best albeit moderate discrimination ability for the prediction of non-CMR. Significant mutual correlations of all variables, in particular between mid-MTV‑S and mid-TLG‑S and between mid-MTV and mid-TLG, were found (all p < 0.05).

Conclusion: Our study confirmed that when using the midtreatment PET/MRI we are able to identify metabolic parameters having the discrimination ability for the prediction of non-CMR. In particular mid-MTV‑S, mid-MTV, mid-tumor size, mid-TLG‑S, mid-TLG and ∆%SUVmax.

ABSTRACT:
Objective: Simultaneous PET/MRIs vary in their quantitative PET performance due to inherent differences in the physical systems and differences in the image reconstruction implementation. This variability in quantitative accuracy confounds the ability to meaningfully combine and compare data across scanners. In this work, we define image reconstruction parameters that lead to comparable contrast recovery curves across simultaneous PET/MRI systems.

Method: The NEMA NU-2 image quality phantom was imaged on one GE Signa and on one Siemens mMR PET/MRI scanner. The phantom was imaged at 9.7:1 contrast with standard spheres (diameter 10, 13, 17, 22, 28, 37 mm) and with custom spheres (diameter: 8.5, 11.5, 15, 25, 32.5, 44 mm) using a standardized methodology. Analysis was performed on a 30 min listmode data acquisition and on 6 realizations of 5 min from the listmode data. Images were reconstructed with the manufacturer provided iterative image reconstruction algorithms with and without point spread function (PSF) modeling. For both scanners, a post-reconstruction Gaussian filter of 3-7 mm in steps of 1 mm was applied. Attenuation correction was provided from a scaled computed tomography (CT) image of the phantom registered to the MR-based attenuation images and verified to align on the non-attenuation corrected PET images. For each of these image reconstruction parameter sets, contrast recovery coefficients (CRCs) were determined for the SUVmean, SUVmaxand SUVpeakfor each sphere. A hybrid metric combining the root-mean-squared discrepancy (RMSD) and the absolute CRC values was used to simultaneously optimize for best match in CRC between the two scanners while simultaneously weighting toward higher resolution reconstructions. The image reconstruction parameter set was identified as the best candidate reconstruction for each vendor for harmonized PET image reconstruction.

Results: The range of clinically relevant image reconstruction parameters demonstrated widely different quantitative performance across cameras. The best match of CRC curves was obtained at the lowest RMSD values with: for CRCmean, 2 iterations-7 mm filter on the GE Signa and 4 iterations-6 mm filter on the Siemens mMR, for CRCmax, 4 iterations-6 mm filter on the GE Signa, 4 iterations-5 mm filter on the Siemens mMR and for CRCpeak, 4 iterations-7 mm filter with PSF on the GE Signa and 4 iterations-7 mm filter on the Siemens mMR. Over all reconstructions, the RMSD between CRCs was 1.8%, 3.6% and 2.9% for CRC mean, max and peak, respectively. The solution of 2 iterations-3 mm on the GE Signa and 4 iterations-3 mm on Siemens mMR, both with PSF, led to simultaneous harmonization and with high CRC and low RMSD for CRC mean, max and peak with RMSD values of 2.8%, 5.8% and 3.2%, respectively.

Conclusions: For two commercially available PET/MRI scanners, user-selectable parameters that control iterative updates, image smoothing and PSF modeling provide a range of contrast recovery curves that allow harmonization in harmonization strategies of optimal match in CRC or high CRC values. This work demonstrates that nearly identical CRC curves can be obtained on different commercially available scanners by selecting appropriate image reconstruction parameters.

TITLE: Musiré: multimodal simulation and reconstruction framework for the radiological imaging sciences

AUTHORS: Jörg Peter

JOURNAL: Philosophical transactions. Series A, Mathematical, physical, and engineering sciences

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
A software-based workflow is proposed for managing the execution of simulation and image reconstruction for SPECT, PET, CBCT, MRI, BLI and FMI packages in single and multimodal biomedical imaging applications. The workflow is composed of a Bash script, the purpose of which is to provide an interface to the user, and to organize data flow between dedicated programs for simulation and reconstruction. The currently incorporated simulation programs comprise GATE for Monte Carlo simulation of SPECT, PET and CBCT, SpinScenario for simulating MRI, and Lipros for Monte Carlo simulation of BLI and FMI. Currently incorporated image reconstruction programs include CASToR for SPECT and PET as well as RTK for CBCT. MetaImage (mhd) standard is used for voxelized phantom and image data format. Meshlab project (mlp) containers incorporating polygon meshes and point clouds defined by the Stanford triangle format (ply) are employed to represent anatomical structures for optical simulation, and to represent tumour cell inserts. A number of auxiliary programs have been developed for data transformation and adaptive parameter assignment. The software workflow uses fully automatic distribution to, and consolidation from, any number of Linux workstations and CPU cores. Example data are presented for clinical SPECT, PET and MRI systems using the Mida head phantom and for preclinical X-ray, PET and BLI systems employing the Digimouse phantom. The presented method unifies and simplifies multimodal simulation setup and image reconstruction management and might be of value for synergistic image research. This article is part of the theme issue 'Synergistic tomographic image reconstruction: part 2'.

ABSTRACT:
Recent advances in PET image reconstruction have focused on achieving high image quality and quantitative accuracy. Bayesian penalized likelihood (BPL) algorithms, such as Q.Clear and HYPER Iterative that have been integrated into commercial PET systems offer robust image noise suppression and edge preservation through regularization. In parallel, methods based on deep learning such as SubtlePET, AiCE, uAI®HYPER DLR, and Precision DL have emerged primarily as post-processing techniques. They use trained convolutional neural networks to reduce image noise while preserving lesion contrast. These methods have reduced image acquisition times or reduced radiotracer doses while maintaining diagnostic confidence. uAI®HYPER DPR represents a hybrid approach by embedding deep learning in iterative reconstruction. This review summarizes the technical principles and the clinical performance of BPL and deep learning-based PET reconstruction algorithms, and discusses key considerations such as image quality and quantitative accuracy of PET images. This review should deepen understanding of advanced PET image reconstruction techniques and accelerate their clinical implementation across diverse PET imaging applications.

TITLE: Comparison of a contrast-to-noise ratio-driven exposure control and a regular detector dose-driven exposure control in abdominal imaging in a clinical angiography system

AUTHORS: Thomas Werncke, Marius Kemling, Stanislav Tashenov, Jan B Hinrichs, Timo C Meine, Sabine K Maschke, Yiannis Kyriakou, Frank K Wacker, Bernhard C Meyer

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: The first purpose of this phantom study was to verify whether a contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR)-driven exposure control (CEC) can maintain target CNR in angiography more precisely compared to a conventional detector dose-driven exposure control (DEC). The second purpose was to estimate the difference between incident air kerma produced by CEC and DEC when both exposure controls reach the same CNR.

Methods: A standardized 3D-printed phantom with an iron foil and a cavity, filled with iodinated contrast material, was developed to measure CNR using different image acquisition settings. This phantom was placed into a stack of polymethylmethacrylate and aluminum plates, simulating a patient equivalent thickness (PET) of 2.5-40 cm. Images were acquired using fluoroscopy and digital radiography modes with CEC using one image quality level and four image quality gradients and DEC having three different detector dose levels. The spatial frequency weighted CNR and incident air kerma were determined. The differences in incident air kerma between DEC and CEC were estimated.

Results: When using DEC, CNR decreased continuously with increasing attenuation, while CEC within physical limits maintained a predefined CNR level. Furthermore, CEC could be parameterized to deliver the CNR as a predefined function of PET. To provide a given CNR level, CEC used equal or lower air kerma than DEC. The mean estimated incident air kerma of CEC compared to DEC was between 3% (PET 20 cm) and 40% (PET 27.5 cm) lower in fluoroscopy and between 1% (PET 20 cm) and 55% (PET 2.5 cm) lower in digital radiography while maintaining CNR.

Conclusion: Within physical and legislative limits, the CEC allows for a flexible adjustment of the CNR as a function of PET. Thus, the CEC enables task-dependent examination protocols with predefined image quality in order to easier achieve the as low as reasonably achievable principle. CEC required equal or lower incident air kerma than DEC to provide similar CNR, which allows for a substantial reduction of skin radiation dose in these situations.

TITLE: Evaluation and optimization of radiomics features stability to respiratory motion in 18 F-FDG 3D PET imaging

AUTHORS: Hui Xu, Wenbing Lv, Hongyan Zhang, Jianhua Ma, Peng Zhao, Lijun Lu

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: To evaluate the impact of respiratory motion on radiomics features in18F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose three dimensional positron emission tomography (18F-FDG 3D PET) imaging and optimize feature stability by combining preprocessing configurations and aggregation strategies.

Methods: An in-house developed respiratory motion phantom was imaged in 3D PET scanner under nine respiratory patterns including one reference pattern. In total, 487 radiomics features were extracted for each respiratory pattern. Feature stability to respiratory motion was first evaluated by metrics of coefficient of variation (COV) and relative difference (RD) in a fixed preprocessing configuration. Further, one-way ANOVA and trend analysis were performed to evaluate the impact of preprocessing configuration (voxel size, discretization scheme) and aggregation strategy on feature stability. Finally, an optimization framework was proposed by selected feature-specific configurations with minimum COV value, and the diagnostic performance was validated in stable versus unstable features and fixed versus optimal features by a set of 46 patients with lung disease.

Results: PET radiomics features were sensitive to respiratory motion, only 79/487 (16%) features were identified to be very stable in the fixed configuration. Preprocessing configuration and aggregation strategy had an impact on feature stability. For different voxel size, bin number, bin size and aggregation strategy, 188/487 (39%), 70/487 (15%), 148/487 (30%), and 38/95 (29%) features appeared significant changes in feature stability. The optimized configuration had the potential to improve feature stability compared to fixed configuration, with the COV decreased from 22% ±24% to 16% ±20%. Regarding the diagnostic performance, the stable and optimal configuration features outperformed the unstable and fixed configuration features, respectively (AUC 0.88, 0.87 vs. 0.83, 0.85).

Conclusions: Respiratory motion shows considerable impact on feature stability in 3D PET imaging, while optimizing preprocessing configuration may improve feature stability and diagnostic performance.

TITLE: Validation of regional myocardial blood flow quantification using three-dimensional PET with rubidium-82: repeatability and comparison with two-dimensional PET data acquisition

AUTHORS: Osamu Manabe, Ran Klein, Chietsugu Katoh, Keiichi Magota, Robert A deKemp, Masanao Naya, Nagara Tamaki, Keiichiro Yoshinaga

JOURNAL: Nuclear medicine communications

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Introduction: Three-dimensional (3D) data acquisition is now standard on PET/computed tomography scanners. The aim of this study was to evaluate the repeatability of myocardial blood flow (MBF) estimation with rubidium-82 (Rb) 3D PET and to validate regional MBF measurements by comparison with two-dimensional (2D) PET.

Patients and methods: Fifteen healthy individuals (31.6 ± 11.4 years old) were enrolled for the evaluation of the short-term repeatability of rest 3D MBF quantification. Another 19 healthy individuals (35.3 ± 12.6 years old) underwent rest and pharmacological stress PET using 2D and 3D data acquisition within a 1-month interval. The injected dose was 1500 MBq for 2D and 555 MBq for 3D PET acquisition.

Results: MBF at rest showed good repeatability [whole left ventricular MBF; 0.54 ± 0.13 vs. 0.52 ± 0.13 mL/min/g, P = 0.98]. Rest MBF, stress MBF, and myocardial flow reserve (MFR) were not significantly different between 3D and 2D data acquisition. 3D MBF correlated well with 2D MBF over a wide flow range for both whole left ventricular (r = 0.97, P < 0.0001) and regional values (r = 0.61, P < 0.0001).

Conclusion: MBF measured with 3D PET showed very good test-retest repeatability. Whole left ventricular and regional MBF measurements obtained using lower Rb-dose 3D PET were highly correlated over a wide range with those from 2D PET. Therefore, MBF with 3D PET can be applied using a lower Rb dosage in clinical settings with reduced radiation exposure.

TITLE: 3D in-system calibration method for PET detectors

AUTHORS: Yannick Kuhl, Florian Mueller, Julian Thull, Stephan Naunheim, David Schug, Volkmar Schulz

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Background: Light-sharing detector designs for positron emission tomography (PET) systems have sparked interest in the scientific community. Particularly, (semi-)monoliths show generally good performance characteristics regarding 2D positioning, energy-, and timing resolution, as well as readout area. This is combined with intrinsic depth-of-interaction (DOI) capability to ensure a homogeneous spatial resolution across the entire field of view (FoV). However, complex positioning calibration processes limit their use in PET systems, especially in large-scale clinical systems.

Purpose: This work proposes a new 3D positioning in-system calibration method for fast and convenient (re-)calibration and quality control of assembled PET scanners. The method targets all kinds of PET detectors that achieve the best performance with individual calibration, including complex segmented detector designs. The in-system calibration method is evaluated and empirically compared to a state-of-the-art fan-beam calibration for a small-diameter proof of concept (PoC) scanner. A simulation study evaluates the method's applicability to different scanner geometries.

Methods: A PoC scanner geometry of 120 mm inner diameter and 150 mm axial extent was set up consisting of five identical finely segmented slab detectors (one detector under test and four collimation detectors). A22Na point source was moved in a circular path inside the FoV. Utilizing virtual collimation and by selecting gamma rays incident approximately perpendicular to the detector normal of the detector under test, training data was created for the training of a 2D positioning model with the machine-learning technique gradient tree boosting (GTB). Data with oblique ray angles was acquired in the same measurement for subsequent angular DOI calibration. For this, a 2D position estimate in the detector under test was calculated first. On this basis, the DOI label was calculated geometrically from the ray path within the detector to finally establish up to 3D training data.

Results: With a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.8 and 1.19 mm full-width at half maximum (FWHM) along the planar-monolithic slab dimension, the in-system methods performed similarly within 1% to the fan-beam collimator results. The DOI performance was at ∼90% with 1.13 mm MAE and 2.47 mm FWHM to the fan-beam collimator. Analytical calculations suggest an improved performance for larger scanner geometries.

Conclusion: The functionality of the 3D in-system positioning calibration method was successfully demonstrated with the measurements within a PoC scanner configuration with similar positioning performance as the bench-top fan-beam setup. The in-system calibration method can be used to calibrate and test fully assembled PET systems to enable more complex light-sharing detector architectures in, for example, large PET systems with many detectors. The acquired data can further be used for more complex energy and time calibrations.

TITLE: Synthesized Image Reconstruction for Post-Reconstruction Resolution Recovery

AUTHORS: Laurence Vass, Andrew J Reader

JOURNAL: IEEE transactions on radiation and plasma medical sciences

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Resolution recovery (RR) techniques in positron emission tomography (PET) imaging aim to mitigate spatial resolution losses and related inaccuracies in quantification by using a model of the system's point spread function (PSF) during reconstruction or post-processing. However, including PSF modeling in fully 3-D image reconstruction is far from trivial as access to the scanner-specific forward and back-projectors is required, along with access to the 3-D sinogram data. Hence, post-reconstruction RR methods, such as the Richardson-Lucy (RL) algorithm, can be more practical. However, the RL method leads to relatively rapid noise amplification in early image iterations, giving inferior image quality compared to iterates obtained by placing the PSF model in the reconstruction algorithm. We propose a post-reconstruction RR method by synthesizing PET data by a forward projection of an initial real data reconstruction (such reconstructions are usually available via a scanner's standard reconstruction software). The synthetic PET data are then used to reconstruct an image, but crucially now including a modeled PSF within the system model used during reconstruction. Results from simulations and real data demonstrate the proposed method improves image quality compared to the RL algorithm, whilst avoiding the need for scanner-specific projectors and raw sinogram data (as required by standard PSF modeling within reconstruction).

TITLE: SimPET: a Preclinical PET Insert for Simultaneous PET/MR Imaging

AUTHORS: Jeong-Whan Son, Kyeong Yun Kim, Ji Yong Park, Kyuwan Kim, Yun-Sang Lee, Guen Bae Ko, Jae Sung Lee

JOURNAL: Molecular imaging and biology

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: SimPET/M7 system is a small-animal dedicated simultaneous positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI) scanner. The SimPET insert has been upgraded from its prototype with a focus on count rate performance and sensitivity. The M7 scanner is a 1-T permanent magnet-based compact MRI system without any cryogens. Here, we present performance evaluation results of SimPET along with the results of mutual interference evaluation and simultaneously acquired PET/MR imaging.

Procedures: Following NEMA NU 4-2008 standard, we evaluated the performance of the SimPET system. The M7 MRI compatibility of SimPET was also assessed by analyzing MRI images of a uniform phantom under different PET conditions and PET count rates with different MRI pulse sequences. Mouse imaging was performed including a whole-body18F-NaF PET scan and a simultaneous PET/MRI scan with64Cu-NOTA-ironoxide.

Results: The spatial resolution at center based on 3D OSEM without and with warm background was 0.7 mm and 1.45 mm, respectively. Peak sensitivity was 4.21 % (energy window = 250-750 keV). The peak noise equivalent count rate with the same energy window was 151 kcps at 38.4 MBq. The uniformity was 4.42 %, and the spillover ratios in water- and air-filled chambers were 14.6 % and 12.7 %, respectively. In the hot rod phantom image, 0.75-mm-diameter rods were distinguishable. There were no remarkable differences in the SNR and uniformity of MRI images and PET count rates with different PET conditions and MRI pulse sequences. In the whole-body18F-NaF PET images, fine skeletal structures were well resolved. In the simultaneous PET/MRI study with64Cu-NOTA-ironoxide, both PET and MRI signals changed before and after injection of the dual-modal imaging probe, which was evident with the exact spatiotemporal correlation.

Conclusions: We demonstrated that the SimPET scanner has a high count rate performance and excellent spatial resolution. The combined SimPET/M7 enabled simultaneous PET/MR imaging studies with no remarkable mutual interference between the two imaging modalities.

TITLE: Anatomy-guided PET reconstruction using l1bowsher prior

AUTHORS: Seung Kwan Kang, Jae Sung Lee

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Advances in simultaneous positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI) technology have led to an active investigation of the anatomy-guided regularized PET image reconstruction algorithm based on MR images. Among the various priors proposed for anatomy-guided regularized PET image reconstruction, Bowsher's method based on second-order smoothing priors sometimes suffers from over-smoothing of detailed structures. Therefore, in this study, we propose a Bowsher prior based on thel1-norm and an iteratively reweighting scheme to overcome the limitation of the original Bowsher method. In addition, we have derived a closed solution for iterative image reconstruction based on this non-smooth prior. A comparison study between the originall2and proposedl1Bowsher priors was conducted using computer simulation and real human data. In the simulation and real data application, small lesions with abnormal PET uptake were better detected by the proposedl1Bowsher prior methods than the original Bowsher prior. The originall2Bowsher leads to a decreased PET intensity in small lesions when there is no clear separation between the lesions and surrounding tissue in the anatomical prior. However, the proposedl1Bowsher prior methods showed better contrast between the tumors and surrounding tissues owing to the intrinsic edge-preserving property of the prior which is attributed to the sparseness induced byl1-norm, especially in the iterative reweighting scheme. Besides, the proposed methods demonstrated lower bias and less hyper-parameter dependency on PET intensity estimation in the regions with matched anatomical boundaries in PET and MRI. Therefore, these methods will be useful for improving the PET image quality based on the anatomical side information.

TITLE: LCPR-Net: low-count PET image reconstruction using the domain transform and cycle-consistent generative adversarial networks

AUTHORS: Hengzhi Xue, Qiyang Zhang, Sijuan Zou, Weiguang Zhang, Chao Zhou, Changjun Tie, Qian Wan, Yueyang Teng, Yongchang Li, Dong Liang, Xin Liu, Yongfeng Yang, Hairong Zheng, Xiaohua Zhu, Zhanli Hu

JOURNAL: Quantitative imaging in medicine and surgery

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Background: Reducing the radiation tracer dose and scanning time during positron emission tomography (PET) imaging can reduce the cost of the tracer, reduce motion artifacts, and increase the efficiency of the scanner. However, the reconstructed images to be noisy. It is very important to reconstruct high-quality images with low-count (LC) data. Therefore, we propose a deep learning method called LCPR-Net, which is used for directly reconstructing full-count (FC) PET images from corresponding LC sinogram data.

Methods: Based on the framework of a generative adversarial network (GAN), we enforce a cyclic consistency constraint on the least-squares loss to establish a nonlinear end-to-end mapping process from LC sinograms to FC images. In this process, we merge a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a residual network for feature extraction and image reconstruction. In addition, the domain transform (DT) operation sends a priori information to the cycle-consistent GAN (CycleGAN) network, avoiding the need for a large amount of computational resources to learn this transformation.

Results: The main advantages of this method are as follows. First, the network can use LC sinogram data as input to directly reconstruct an FC PET image. The reconstruction speed is faster than that provided by model-based iterative reconstruction. Second, reconstruction based on the CycleGAN framework improves the quality of the reconstructed image.

Conclusions: Compared with other state-of-the-art methods, the quantitative and qualitative evaluation results show that the proposed method is accurate and effective for FC PET image reconstruction.

JOURNAL: Journal of clinical and experimental hematopathology : JCEH

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
90Y-Ibritumomab tiuxetan (IT) therapy is a radioimmunotherapy for indolent B-cell lymphoma. Several predictors of insufficient therapeutic effects have been reported. We performed a retrospective study at a single institute to investigate whether111In SPECT/CT can predict the therapeutic effects and grade of cytopenia due to90Y-IT therapy. We enrolled 16 consecutive patients who underwent90Y-IT therapy, including 15 who underwent111In-IT SPECT/CT. After90Y-IT therapy, there were 4 patients in complete remission in whom the lesion SUVmaxon111In-IT SPECT/CT and soluble IL-2 receptor were significantly lower than those of the other patients (P<0.05 and P<0.05, respectively). Based on the log-rank test of factors associated with the progression-free survival (PFS), ≥2 previous treatment regimens was significantly associated with a poor prognosis (P<0.05). The SUV on111In-IT SPECT/CT may be a good predictor of the clinical response to90Y-IT therapy.

TITLE: Near-lossless compression of PET/CT images using singular value decomposition

AUTHORS: Jagrati Chaudhary, Anil Kumar Pandey, Param D Sharma, Jasim Jaleel, Chetan Patel, Chandra Sekhar Bal, Rakesh Kumar

JOURNAL: Nuclear medicine communications

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Aims and objectives: The aim of the study is to compare the single matrix approach and slice-by-slice approach for computing singular value decomposition (SVD) to achieve near-lossless compression of PET/CT images.

Materials and methods: The parameters used for comparison were SVD computation time, percentage compression and percentage difference between ROI counts on compressed and original images. SVD of 49 F-18-FDG PET/CT studies (33 370 PET/CT images) was computed using both approaches. The smaller singular values contributing insignificant information to the image were truncated, and then, the compressed image was reconstructed. A mask (101 × 101pixels) was used to extract the ROI counts from compressed and original images. Two nuclear medicine physicians compared compressed images with their corresponding original images for loss of clinical details and the presence of generated artifacts. Structural Similarity Index Measure, blur, brightness, contrast per pixel and global contrast factor were used for objective assessment of image quality. Wilcoxon test was applied to find a statistically significant difference between the parameters used for comparison at alpha = 0.05.

Results: Nuclear medicine physicians found compressed image identical to the corresponding original image. The values of comparation parameters were significantly larger for the single matrix approach in comparison with the slice-by-slice approach. The maximum percentage error between the compressed image and original image was less than 5%.

Conclusions: Up to 64 % and 44% near-lossless compression of PET and CT images were achieved, respectively using the slice-by-slice approach, and up to 58 and 53% near-lossless compression of PET and CT images were achieved respectively using the single matrix approach.

TITLE: Impact of a contrast-to-noise ratio driven and material specific exposure control on image quality and radiation exposure in angiography

AUTHORS: Thomas Werncke, Marius Kemling, Stanislav Tashenov, Jan B Hinrichs, Timo C Meine, Sabine K Maschke, Yiannis Kyriakou, Frank K Wacker, Bernhard C Meyer

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Conventional detector-dose driven exposure controls (DEC) do not consider the contrasting material of interest in angiography. Considering the latter when choosing the acquisition parameters should allow for optimization of x-ray quality and consecutively lead to a substantial reduction of radiation exposure. Therefore, the impact of a material-specific, contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) driven exposure control (CEC) compared to DEC on radiation exposure was investigated. A 3D-printed phantom containing iron, tantalum, and platinum foils and cavities, filled with iodine, barium, and gas (carbon dioxide), was developed to measure the CNR. This phantom was placed within a stack of polymethylmethacrylate and aluminum plates simulating a patient equivalent thickness (PET) of 2.5-40 cm. Fluoroscopy and digital radiography (DR) were conducted applying either CEC or three, regular DEC protocols with parameter settings used in abdominal interventions. CEC protocols where chosen to achieve material-specific CNR values similar to those of DEC. Incident air kerma at the reference point(Ka,r), using either CEC or DEC, was assessed and possible Ka,rreduction for similar CNR was estimated. We show that CEC provided similar CNR as DEC at the same or lower Ka,r. When imaging barium, iron, and iodine Ka,rwas substantially reduced below a PET of 20 cm and between 25 cm and 30 cm for fluoroscopy and Dr When imaging platinum and tantalum using fluoroscopy and DR and gas using DR, the Ka,rreduction was substantially higher. We estimate the Ka,rreduction for these materials between 15% and 84% for fluoroscopy and DR between 15% and 93% depending on the PET. The results of this study demonstrate a high potential for skin dose reduction in abdominal radiology when using a material-specific CEC compared to DEC. This effect is substantial in imaging materials with higher energy K-edges, which is beneficial, for example, in long-lasting embolization procedures with tantalum-based embolization material in young patients with arterio-venous malformations.

JOURNAL: Data in brief

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
The data presented here provide information about the role of reconstruction parameters on Positron Emission Tomography (PET) image quantification. Multiple phantom measurements in four different Spheres to Background Ratio (SBR) were performed on Biograph 6 TruePoint TrueV PET/CT scanner. PET raw data were reconstructed with/without resolution recovery algorithm using six various iteration x subsets with five different Full-Width Half-Maximum (FWHM) values of Gaussian post-smoothing filter. The Recovery Coefficient (RC) of six spheres using three common Volume of Interest (VOI) methods (max, 3D-50% Isocontour, and peak) were calculated. Moreover, SUVmax, SUVmean, and SUVpeakand volumetric indices, such as metabolic tumor volume (MTV), volume recovery coefficient (VRC), and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) were measured. RCmax, RC50%,and RCpeakas a function of sphere size were plotted in all reconstruction methods considering different SBRs. The data could be noticeable for standardization and optimization of quantitative metrics in PET imaging.

ABSTRACT:
The head and neck phantom discussed in an accompanying paper (part 1), is imaged with MRI, X-ray CT, PET and ultrasound. MRI scans show a distinct image contrast between the brain compartment and other anatomical regions of the head. The silicone matrix that was used to create a porous brain compartment has a relatively high proton density and a spin-spin relaxation time (T2) that is long enough to provide an MRI signal. While the longitudinal magnetization was found to recover according to a mono-exponential, a bi-exponential decay was observed for the transverse relaxation with a slow T2relaxation component corresponding to the perfusate and a fast T2relaxation component corresponding to the silicone. The fraction of the slow T2relaxation component increases upon perfusion. A dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI experiment is conducted in which the injection rate of the contrast agent is varied. Parametric DCE maps are created and reveal regional differences in contrast agent kinetics as a result of differences in porosity. The skull, vertebra and the brain compartment are clearly visible on X-ray CT. Dynamic PET scanning has been performed while the carotic arterial input function is monitored by use of a Geiger-Müller counter. Similar regions of perfusion are found in the PET study as in the DCE MRI study. By doping the perfusate with a lipid micelle emulsion, the phantom is applicable for carotic Doppler ultrasound demonstration and validation.

TITLE: Fusion 3D T1/T2 MRI for diagnosing pelvic deep infiltrating endometriosis: a non-inferiority study

AUTHORS: Alexandre Stolz, Lawrence Fabian Pupulim, María Rojas Soldado, Patrick Chabloz, Karen Kinkel

JOURNAL: European journal of radiology

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an essential non-invasive technique for diagnosing deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE). Published studies have explored the value of high-resolution fat-suppressed 3D T1-weighted (T1w) and 3D T2-weighted (T2w) MRI in this topic. However, research on the fusion of these sequences in a merged 'PET-scanner-like' multiplanar reconstruction (Fusion 3D T1/T2) is still lacking. Our primary objective was to assess whether the diagnostic accuracy of Fusion 3D T1/T2 was non-inferior to the state-of-the-art MRI protocol for diagnosing DIE. This standard protocol consists of 2D T2w images in various planes and axial T1w images displayed on a four-window screen (STANDARD). The non-inferiority margin was set at 2.5 %. Fifty-nine pelvic MRI examinations for suspected endometriosis were interpreted independently by two radiologists with different experience levels (R#1 and R#2), randomly with both protocols. Results were compared with a consensus opinion from an expert panel. Interpretation time and inter-reader agreement were also evaluated. Using the Fusion 3D T1/T2 protocol, R#1's diagnostic accuracy for DIE was 94.74% (95%CI: 92.48-96.47) and R#2's was 98.68% (95%CI: 97.31-99.47), both of which were non-inferior to the STANDARD protocol (R#1, 92.48%, 95%CI: 89.90-94.57; R#2, 96.43%, 95%CI: 94.48-97.84). The Fusion 3D T1/T2 protocol reduced interpretation time by 24.5 % (P < 0.001) compared to the STANDARD. Additionally, it improved inter-reader reproducibility, with a moderate level of agreement (kappa = 0.72; 95 % CI: 0.63-0.81), compared to the slight agreement (kappa = 0.47; 95 % CI: 0.34-0.59) observed with the STANDARD protocol. In conclusion, Fusion 3D T1/T2 demonstrated non-inferior diagnostic accuracy compared to the current MRI standard protocol. It also improved reproducibility and reduced interpretation time, suggesting its potential as a valuable tool for diagnosing pelvic DIE.

AUTHORS: Haijie Zhang, Fu Yin, Liyang Yang, Anqi Qi, Weiwei Cui, Shanshan Yang, Ge Wen

JOURNAL: Journal of healthcare engineering

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
This study was to explore the clinical application value of computed tomography (CT) images based on a three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction algorithm for laparoscopic partial nephrectomy (LPN) in patients with renal tumors. 30 cases of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patients admitted to the hospital were selected as the research objects and were rolled into two groups using a random table method. The patients who received PLN under the three-dimensional reconstruction and laparoscopic technique were included in the experimental group (group A), and the patients who received LPN using CT images only were included in the control group (group B). In addition, the treatment results of the two groups of patients were compared and analyzed.Results. The effective rate of the established model was 93.3%; the total renal arteriovenous variability of group A (13.3%) was higher than that of group B (6.7%), and the operation time (131.5 ± 32.1 minutes) was much lower than that of group B (158.7 ± 36.2 minutes), showing statistical significance (P< 0.05).Conclusion. CT images based on 3D reconstruction algorithms had high clinical application value for LPN in patients with renal tumors, which could improve the efficiency and safety of LPN.

TITLE: Modified kernel MLAA using autoencoder for PET-enabled dual-energy CT

AUTHORS: Siqi Li, Guobao Wang

JOURNAL: Philosophical transactions. Series A, Mathematical, physical, and engineering sciences

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Combined use of PET and dual-energy CT provides complementary information for multi-parametric imaging. PET-enabled dual-energy CT combines a low-energy X-ray CT image with a high-energyγ-ray CT (GCT) image reconstructed from time-of-flight PET emission data to enable dual-energy CT material decomposition on a PET/CT scanner. The maximum-likelihood attenuation and activity (MLAA) algorithm has been used for GCT reconstruction but suffers from noise. Kernel MLAA exploits an X-ray CT image prior through the kernel framework to guide GCT reconstruction and has demonstrated substantial improvements in noise suppression. However, similar to other kernel methods for image reconstruction, the existing kernel MLAA uses image intensity-based features to construct the kernel representation, which is not always robust and may lead to suboptimal reconstruction with artefacts. In this paper, we propose a modified kernel method by using an autoencoder convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract an intrinsic feature set from the X-ray CT image prior. A computer simulation study was conducted to compare the autoencoder CNN-derived feature representation with raw image patches for evaluation of kernel MLAA for GCT image reconstruction and dual-energy multi-material decomposition. The results show that the autoencoder kernel MLAA method can achieve a significant image quality improvement for GCT and material decomposition as compared to the existing kernel MLAA algorithm. A weakness of the proposed method is its potential over-smoothness in a bone region, indicating the importance of further optimization in future work. This article is part of the theme issue 'Synergistic tomographic image reconstruction: part 2'.

TITLE: The impact of long axial field of view (LAFOV) PET on oncologic imaging

AUTHORS: Gary J R Cook, Ian L Alberts, Thomas Wagner, B Malene Fischer, Muhummad Sohaib Nazir, David Lilburn

JOURNAL: European journal of radiology

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
The development of long axial field of view (LAFOV) positron emission tomography coupled with computed tomography (PET/CT) scanners might be considered the biggest step forward in PET imaging since it became a mainstream clinical modality. Despite increased capital and maintenance costs and data storage requirements, the improvement in image quality, significantly faster acquisition times and lower radiopharmaceutical administered activities, allow a high quality and more efficient clinical service. This step change in technology overcomes some of the limitations of standard short axial field of view scanners. It allows simultaneous imaging of all body systems, and with the ability to obtain high temporal resolution data, it increases potential research applications, particularly in multisystem disease or for dosimetry measurements of novel radiopharmaceuticals. The improvements in sensitivity and signal-to-noise facilitates the use of tracers with long half-lives and low administered activity (e.g. [89Zr]-labelled monoclonal antibodies) or very short half-lives (e.g. [82Rb]), opening up applications that hitherto have been challenging. It is early in the evolution of LAFOV PET/CT and the advantages these systems offer have still to be fully realised in providing additional impact in clinical practice. In this article we describe the potential advantages of LAFOV PET technology and some of the clinical and research applications where it has been applied as well as some of the future developments that may enhance the modality further.

TITLE: Impact of image reconstruction on cerebral blood flow measured with 15O-water positron emission tomography

AUTHORS: Elin Bäck, My Jonasson, Elin Lindström, Andreas Tolf, Joachim Burman, Lieuwe Appel, Mark Lubberink

JOURNAL: EJNMMI physics

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Background: 15O-water positron emission tomography (PET) is considered the gold standard method for non-invasive measurement of cerebral blood flow (CBF). However, previously published average CBF values in healthy subjects have varied greatly and the cause of these variations remains unclear. This study investigates how image reconstruction methods and spatial resolution affect CBF measurements with15O-water PET.

Methods: Eight healthy subjects each underwent dynamic15O-water PET scans with continuous arterial blood sampling. Images were reconstructed using two different algorithms; ordered subset expectation maximisation and block sequential regularised expectation maximalisation with varying reconstruction parameters. CBF was estimated for the whole brain, grey matter, and central white matter. Reconstruction-specific effective spatial resolution was estimated using phantom measurements and simulations.

Results: The mean whole brain CBF was 0.48 mL/cm3/min and showed little dependence on the image reconstruction method. Grey matter CBF varied between 0.52 and 0.57 mL/cm3/min, and central white matter CBF between 0.20 and 0.28 mL/cm3/min. Regional CBF showed great dependence on effective spatial resolution with a negative correlation between grey matter CBF and resolution (r = -0.96) and a positive correlation between central white matter and resolution (r = 0.93).

Conclusion: This study concludes that grey matter and central white matter CBF, but not whole brain CBF measured with quantitative15O-water PET is reconstruction method dependent, mainly due to varying spatial resolution with consequent partial volume effects. Variations in published CBF values cannot be explained solely by reconstruction methods or spatial resolution.

TITLE: Positron range in combination with point-spread-function correction: an evaluation of different implementations for [124I]-PET imaging

AUTHORS: Hunor Kertész, Maurizio Conti, Vladimir Panin, Jorge Cabello, Deepak Bharkhada, Thomas Beyer, Laszlo Papp, Walter Jentzen, Jacobo Cal-Gonzalez, Joaquín L Herraiz, Alejandro López-Montes, Ivo Rausch

JOURNAL: EJNMMI physics

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Aim: To evaluate the effect of combining positron range correction (PRC) with point-spread-function (PSF) correction and to compare different methods of implementation into iterative image reconstruction for124I-PET imaging.

Materials and methods: Uniform PR blurring kernels of124I were generated using the GATE (GEANT4) framework in various material environments (lung, water, and bone) and matched to a 3D matrix. The kernels size was set to 11 × 11 × 11 based on the maximum PR in water and the voxel size of the PET system. PET image reconstruction was performed using the standard OSEM algorithm, OSEM with PRC implemented before the forward projection (OSEM+PRC simplified) and OSEM with PRC implemented in both forward- and back-projection steps (full implementation) (OSEM+PRC). Reconstructions were repeated with resolution recovery, point-spread function (PSF) included. The methods and kernel variation were validated using different phantoms filled with124I acquired on a Siemens mCT PET/CT system. The data was evaluated for contrast recovery and image noise.

Results: Contrast recovery improved by 2-10% and 4-37% with OSEM+PRC simplified and OSEM+PRC, respectively, depending on the sphere size of the NEMA IQ phantom. Including PSF in the reconstructions further improved contrast by 4-19% and 3-16% with the PSF+PRC simplified and PSF+PRC, respectively. The benefit of PRC was more pronounced within low-density material. OSEM-PRC and OSEM-PSF as well as OSEM-PSF+PRC in its full- and simplified implementation showed comparable noise and convergence. OSEM-PRC simplified showed comparably faster convergence but at the cost of increased image noise.

Conclusions: The combination of the PSF and PRC leads to increased contrast recovery with reduced image noise compared to stand-alone PSF or PRC reconstruction. For OSEM-PRC reconstructions, a full implementation in the reconstruction is necessary to handle image noise. For the combination of PRC with PSF, a simplified PRC implementation can be used to reduce reconstruction times.

TITLE: An improved patch-based regularization method for PET image reconstruction

AUTHORS: Juan Gao, Qiegen Liu, Chao Zhou, Weiguang Zhang, Qian Wan, Chenxi Hu, Zheng Gu, Dong Liang, Xin Liu, Yongfeng Yang, Hairong Zheng, Zhanli Hu, Na Zhang

JOURNAL: Quantitative imaging in medicine and surgery

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Background: Statistical reconstruction methods based on penalized maximum likelihood (PML) are being increasingly used in positron emission tomography (PET) imaging to reduce noise and improve image quality. Wang and Qi proposed a patch-based edge-preserving penalties algorithm that can be implemented in three simple steps: a maximum-likelihood expectation-maximization (MLEM) image update, an image smoothing step, and a pixel-by-pixel image fusion step. The pixel-by-pixel image fusion step, which fuses the MLEM updated image and the smoothed image, involves a trade-off between preserving the fine structural features of an image and suppressing noise. Particularly when reconstructing images from low-count data, this step cannot preserve fine structural features in detail. To better preserve these features and accelerate the algorithm convergence, we proposed to improve the patch-based regularization reconstruction method.

Methods: Our improved method involved adding a total variation (TV) regularization step following the MLEM image update in the patch-based algorithm. A feature refinement (FR) step was then used to extract the lost fine structural features from the residual image between the TV regularized image and the fused image based on patch regularization. These structural features would then be added back to the fused image. With the addition of these steps, each iteration of the image should gain more structural information. A brain phantom simulation experiment and a mouse study were conducted to evaluate our proposed improved method. Brain phantom simulation with added noise were used to determine the feasibility of the proposed algorithm and its acceleration of convergence. Data obtained from the mouse study were divided into event count sets to validate the performance of the proposed algorithm when reconstructing images from low-count data. Five criteria were used for quantitative evaluation: signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), covariance (COV), contrast recovery coefficient (CRC), regional relative bias, and relative variance.

Results: The bias and variance of the phantom brain image reconstructed using the patch-based method were 0.421 and 5.035, respectively, and this process took 83.637 seconds. The bias and variance of the image reconstructed by the proposed improved method, however, were 0.396 and 4.568, respectively, and this process took 41.851 seconds. This demonstrates that the proposed algorithm accelerated the reconstruction convergence. The CRC of the phantom brain image reconstructed using the patch-based method was iterated 20 times and reached 0.284, compared with the proposed method, which reached 0.446. When using a count of 5,000 K data obtained from the mouse study, both the patch-based method and the proposed method reconstructed images similar to the ground truth image. The intensity of the ground truth image was 88.3, and it was located in the 102ndrow and the 116thcolumn. However, when the count was reduced to below 40 K, and the patch-based method was used, image quality was significantly reduced. This effect was not observed when the proposed method was used. When a count of 40 K was used, the image intensity was 58.79 when iterated 100 times by the patch-based method, and it was located in the 102ndrow and the 116thcolumn, while the intensity when iterated 50 times by the proposed method was 63.83. This suggests that the proposed method improves image reconstruction from low-count data.

Conclusions: This improved method of PET image reconstruction could potentially improve the quality of PET images faster than other methods and also produce better reconstructions from low-count data.

JOURNAL: Physics and imaging in radiation oncology

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Background and purpose: Free breathing (FB) positron emission tomography (PET) images are routinely used in radiotherapy for lung cancer patients. Respiration-induced artifacts in these images compromise treatment response assessment and obstruct clinical implementation of dose painting and PET-guided radiotherapy. The purpose of this study is to develop a blurry image decomposition (BID) method to correct motion-induced image-reconstruction errors in FB-PETs.

Materials and methods: Assuming a blurry PET is represented as an average of multi-phase PETs. A four-dimensional computed-tomography image is deformably registered from the end-inhalation (EI) phase to other phases. With the registration-derived deformation maps, PETs at other phases can be deformed from a PET at the EI phase. To reconstruct the EI-PET, the difference between the blurry PET and the average of the deformed EI-PETs is minimized using a maximum-likelihood expectation-maximization algorithm. The developed method was evaluated with computational and physical phantoms as well as PET/CT images acquired from three patients.

Results: The BID method increased the signal-to-noise ratio from 1.88 ± 1.05 to 10.5 ± 3.3 and universal-quality index from 0.72 ± 0.11 to 1.0 for the computational phantoms, and reduced the motion-induced error from 69.9% to 10.9% in the maximum of activity concentration and from 317.5% to 8.7% in the full width at half maximum of the physical PET-phantom. The BID-based corrections increased the maximum standardized-uptake values by 17.7 ± 15.4% and reduced tumor volumes by 12.5 ± 10.4% on average for the three patients.

Conclusions: The proposed image-decomposition method reduces respiration-induced errors in PET images and holds potential to improve the quality of radiotherapy for thoracic and abdominal cancer patients.

TITLE: The value of 4D fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography in the diagnosis of lung lesions

AUTHORS: Lixia Zhang, Jinyan Chen, Caiyun Xu, Yin Zhang, Lili Qi, Xiyan Zhang

JOURNAL: Nuclear medicine communications

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Objective: This study aimed to assess the clinical value of 4D fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose PET/computed tomography (F-FDG PET/CT) in the differential diagnosis for lung lesions.

Patients and methods: Fifty-eight patients with lung lesions including lung cancer, pneumonia nodules, and benign pulmonary nodules were enrolled. The PET/CT scan was performed immediately (15 min of dynamic scan), at 60 min (early scan), and at 120 min (delayed scan) after the injection of F-FDG. The time-activity curves (TACs) were generated from the dynamic PET. The maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of each lesion at early and delayed scans was measured, and the retention index of SUVmax (RI-SUVmax) was calculated. The cutoff values for SUVmax were determined.

Results: Lung cancer lesions (27/31, 87.1%) exhibited a continuously rising slope of TAC, whereas pneumonia lesions (13/15, 86.66%) and benign pulmonary nodules (12/12, 100%) exhibited a continuously decreasing slope of TAC. The early-SUVmax and delayed-SUVmax in the pneumonia group were significantly lower than those in the lung cancer group, whereas notably higher than those in the benign pulmonary nodules group. The diagnostic accuracy was: delayed-SUVmax > early-SUVmax > RI-SUVmax.

Conclusion: The 4D F-FDG PET/CT exhibited excellent performance with high accuracy in the dynamic PET/CT.

TITLE: Direct and indirect parameter imaging methods for dynamic PET

AUTHORS: Xin Mao, Shujun Zhao, Dongfang Gao, Zhanli Hu, Na Zhang

JOURNAL: Biomedical physics & engineering express

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
The method of reconstructing parametric images from dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) data with the linear Patlak model has been widely used in scientific research and clinical practice. Whether for direct or indirect image reconstruction, researchers have deeply investigated the associated methods and effects. Among the existing methods, the traditional maximum likelihood expectation maximization (MLEM) reconstruction algorithm is fast but produces a substantial amount of noise. If the parameter images obtained by the MLEM algorithm are postfiltered, a large amount of image edge information is lost. Additionally, although the kernel method has a better noise reduction effect, its calculation costs are very high due to the complexity of the algorithm. Therefore, to obtain parametric images with a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and good retention of detailed information, here, we use guided kernel means (GKM) and dynamic PET image information to conduct guided filtering and perform parametric image reconstruction. We apply this method to direct and indirect reconstruction, and through computer simulations, we show that our proposed method has higher identifiability and a greater SNR than conventional direct and indirect reconstruction methods. We also show that our method produces better images with direct than with indirect reconstruction.

TITLE: Implementation of a Spatially-Variant and Tissue-Dependent Positron Range Correction for PET/CT Imaging

AUTHORS: Hunor Kertész, Thomas Beyer, Vladimir Panin, Walter Jentzen, Jacobo Cal-Gonzalez, Alexander Berger, Laszlo Papp, Peter L Kench, Deepak Bharkhada, Jorge Cabello, Maurizio Conti, Ivo Rausch

JOURNAL: Frontiers in physiology

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Aim: To develop and evaluate a new approach for spatially variant and tissue-dependent positron range (PR) correction (PRC) during the iterative PET image reconstruction.

Materials and methods: The PR distributions of three radionuclides (18F,68Ga, and124I) were simulated using the GATE (GEANT4) framework in different material compositions (lung, water, and bone). For every radionuclide, the uniform PR kernel was created by mapping the simulated 3D PR point cloud to a 3D matrix with its size defined by the maximum PR in lung (18F) or water (68Ga and124I) and the PET voxel size. The spatially variant kernels were composed from the uniform PR kernels by analyzing the material composition of the surrounding medium for each voxel before implementation as tissue-dependent, point-spread functions into the iterative image reconstruction. The proposed PRC method was evaluated using the NEMA image quality phantom (18F,68Ga, and124I); two unique PR phantoms were scanned and evaluated following OSEM reconstruction with and without PRC using different metrics, such as contrast recovery, contrast-to-noise ratio, image noise and the resolution evaluated in terms of full width at half maximum (FWHM).

Results: The effect of PRC on18F-imaging was negligible. In contrast, PRC improved image contrast for the 10-mm sphere of the NEMA image quality phantom filled with68Ga and124I by 33 and 24%, respectively. While the effect of PRC was less noticeable for the larger spheres, contrast recovery still improved by 5%. The spatial resolution was improved by 26% for124I (FWHM of 4.9 vs. 3.7 mm).

Conclusion: For high energy positron-emitting radionuclides, the proposed PRC method helped recover image contrast with reduced noise levels and with improved spatial resolution. As such, the PRC approach proposed here can help improve the quality of PET data in clinical practice and research.

TITLE: PARALLELPROJ-an open-source framework for fast calculation of projections in tomography

AUTHORS: Georg Schramm, Kris Thielemans

JOURNAL: Frontiers in nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
In this article, we introduce parallelproj, a novel open-source framework designed for efficient parallel computation of projections in tomography leveraging either multiple CPU cores or GPUs. This framework efficiently implements forward and back projection functions for both sinogram and listmode data, utilizing Joseph's method, which is further extended to encompass time-of-flight (TOF) PET projections. Our evaluation involves a series of tests focusing on PET image reconstruction using data sourced from a state-of-the-art clinical PET/CT system. We thoroughly benchmark the performance of the projectors in non-TOF and TOF, sinogram, and listmode employing multi CPU-cores, hybrid CPU/GPU, and exclusive GPU mode. Moreover, we also investigate the timing of non-TOF sinogram projections calculated in STIR (Software for Tomographic Image Reconstruction) which recently integrated parallelproj as one of its projection backends. Our results indicate that the exclusive GPU mode provides acceleration factors between 25 and 68 relative to the multi-CPU-core mode. Furthermore, we demonstrate that OSEM listmode reconstruction of state-of-the-art real-world PET data sets is achievable within a few seconds using a single consumer GPU.

AUTHORS: George Webber, Yuya Mizuno, Oliver D Howes, Alexander Hammers, Andrew P King, Andrew J Reader

JOURNAL: IEEE transactions on medical imaging

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Medical image reconstruction with pretrained score-based generative models (SGMs) has advantages over other existing state-of-the-art deep-learned reconstruction methods, including improved resilience to different scanner setups and advanced image distribution modeling. SGM-based reconstruction has recently been applied to simulated positron emission tomography (PET) datasets, showing improved contrast recovery for out-of-distribution lesions relative to the state-of-the-art. However, existing methods for SGM-based reconstruction from PET data suffer from slow reconstruction, burdensome hyperparameter tuning and slice inconsistency effects (in 3D). In this work, we propose a practical methodology for fully 3D reconstruction that accelerates reconstruction and reduces the number of critical hyperparameters by matching the likelihood of an SGM's reverse diffusion process to a current iterate of the maximum-likelihood expectation maximization algorithm. Using the example of low-count reconstruction from simulated[18F]DPA-714 datasets, we show our methodology can match or improve on the NRMSE and SSIM of existing state-of-the-art SGM-based PET reconstruction while reducing reconstruction time and the need for hyperparameter tuning. We evaluate our methodology against state-of-the-art supervised and conventional reconstruction algorithms. Finally, we demonstrate a first-ever implementation of SGM-based reconstruction for real 3D PET data, specifically [18F]DPA-714 data, where we integrate perpendicular pre-trained SGMs to eliminate slice inconsistency issues.

TITLE: Head and neck tumor segmentation from [18F]F-FDG PET/CT images based on 3D diffusion model

AUTHORS: Yafei Dong, Kuang Gong

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Objective.Head and neck (H&N) cancers are among the most prevalent types of cancer worldwide, and [18F]F-FDG PET/CT is widely used for H&N cancer management. Recently, the diffusion model has demonstrated remarkable performance in various image-generation tasks. In this work, we proposed a 3D diffusion model to accurately perform H&N tumor segmentation from 3D PET and CT volumes.Approach.The 3D diffusion model was developed considering the 3D nature of PET and CT images acquired. During the reverse process, the model utilized a 3D UNet structure and took the concatenation of 3D PET, CT, and Gaussian noise volumes as the network input to generate the tumor mask. Experiments based on the HECKTOR challenge dataset were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed diffusion model. Several state-of-the-art techniques based on U-Net and Transformer structures were adopted as the reference methods. Benefits of employing both PET and CT as the network input, as well as further extending the diffusion model from 2D to 3D, were investigated based on various quantitative metrics and qualitative results.Main results.Results showed that the proposed 3D diffusion model could generate more accurate segmentation results compared with other methods (mean Dice of 0.739 compared to less than 0.726 for other methods). Compared to the diffusion model in 2D form, the proposed 3D model yielded superior results (mean Dice of 0.739 compared to 0.669). Our experiments also highlighted the advantage of utilizing dual-modality PET and CT data over only single-modality data for H&N tumor segmentation (with mean Dice less than 0.570).Significance.This work demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed 3D diffusion model in generating more accurate H&N tumor segmentation masks compared to the other reference methods.

TITLE: Fast high-resolution lifetime image reconstruction for positron lifetime tomography

AUTHORS: Bangyan Huang, Zipai Wang, Xinjie Zeng, Amir H Goldan, Jinyi Qi

JOURNAL: Communications physics

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Due to the ortho-positronium formed prior to the annihilation, the lifetime of a positron is sensitive to the tissue microenvironment and can potentially provide valuable information for monitoring disease progression and treatment response. However, the lifetime of positrons before annihilation has long been overlooked in current positron emission tomography (PET). Here we develop a positron lifetime image reconstruction method called SIMPLE (Statistical IMage reconstruction of Positron Lifetime via time-wEighting) and demonstrate its performance using a real scan on a time-of-flight PET scanner. The SIMPLE method achieves high-resolution positron lifetime imaging of extended heterogeneous tissue illuminated by a22Na point source, successfully resolving the boundary between muscle and fat. It delivers spatial resolution comparable to that of conventional PET activity images while maintaining a computational cost equivalent to reconstructing two PET images. This work paves the way for clinical translation of high-resolution positron lifetime imaging.

TITLE: Time of Flight in Perspective: Instrumental and Computational Aspects of Time Resolution in Positron Emission Tomography

AUTHORS: Dennis R Schaart, Georg Schramm, Johan Nuyts, Suleman Surti

JOURNAL: IEEE transactions on radiation and plasma medical sciences

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
The first time-of-flight positron emission tomography (TOF-PET) scanners were developed as early as in the 1980s. However, the poor light output and low detection efficiency of TOF-capable detectors available at the time limited any gain in image quality achieved with these TOF-PET scanners over the traditional non-TOF PET scanners. The discovery of LSO and other Lu-based scintillators revived interest in TOF-PET and led to the development of a second generation of scanners with high sensitivity and spatial resolution in the mid-2000s. The introduction of the silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) has recently yielded a third generation of TOF-PET systems with unprecedented imaging performance. Parallel to these instrumentation developments, much progress has been made in the development of image reconstruction algorithms that better utilize the additional information provided by TOF. Overall, the benefits range from a reduction in image variance (SNR increase), through allowing joint estimation of activity and attenuation, to better reconstructing data from limited angle systems. In this work, we review these developments, focusing on three broad areas: 1) timing theory and factors affecting the time resolution of a TOF-PET system; 2) utilization of TOF information for improved image reconstruction; and 3) quantification of the benefits of TOF compared to non-TOF PET. Finally, we offer a brief outlook on the TOF-PET developments anticipated in the short and longer term. Throughout this work, we aim to maintain a clinically driven perspective, treating TOF as one of multiple (and sometimes competitive) factors that can aid in the optimization of PET imaging performance.

JOURNAL: Quantitative imaging in medicine and surgery

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Recently, the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in medical imaging (including nuclear medicine imaging) has rapidly developed. Most AI applications in nuclear medicine imaging have focused on the diagnosis, treatment monitoring, and correlation analyses with pathology or specific gene mutation. It can also be used for image generation to shorten the time of image acquisition, reduce the dose of injected tracer, and enhance image quality. This work provides an overview of the application of AI in image generation for single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET) either without or with anatomical information [CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)]. This review focused on four aspects, including imaging physics, image reconstruction, image postprocessing, and internal dosimetry. AI application in generating attenuation map, estimating scatter events, boosting image quality, and predicting internal dose map is summarized and discussed.

TITLE: Sequential deep learning image enhancement models improve diagnostic confidence, lesion detectability, and image reconstruction time in PET

AUTHORS: Meghi Dedja, Abolfazl Mehranian, Kevin M Bradley, Matthew D Walker, Patrick A Fielding, Scott D Wollenweber, Robert Johnsen, Daniel R McGowan

JOURNAL: EJNMMI physics

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Background: Investigate the potential benefits of sequential deployment of two deep learning (DL) algorithms namely DL-Enhancement (DLE) and DL-based time-of-flight (ToF) (DLT). DLE aims to enhance the rapidly reconstructed ordered-subset-expectation-maximisation algorithm (OSEM) images towards block-sequential-regularised-expectation-maximisation (BSREM) images, whereas DLT aims to improve the quality of BSREM images reconstructed without ToF. As the algorithms differ in their purpose, sequential application may allow benefits from each to be combined. 20 FDG PET-CT scans were performed on a Discovery 710 (D710) and 20 on Discovery MI (DMI; both GE HealthCare). PET data was reconstructed using five combinations of algorithms:1. ToF-BSREM, 2. ToF-OSEM + DLE, 3. OSEM + DLE + DLT, 4. ToF-OSEM + DLE + DLT, 5. ToF-BSREM + DLT. To assess image noise, 30 mm-diameter spherical VOIs were drawn in both lung and liver to measure standard deviation of voxels within the volume. In a blind clinical reading, two experienced readers rated the images on a five-point Likert scale based on lesion detectability, diagnostic confidence, and image quality.

Results: Applying DLE + DLT reduced noise whilst improving lesion detectability, diagnostic confidence, and image reconstruction time. ToF-OSEM + DLE + DLT reconstructions demonstrated an increase in lesion SUVmaxof 28 ± 14% (average ± standard deviation) and 11 ± 5% for data acquired on the D710 and DMI, respectively. The same reconstruction scored highest in clinical readings for both lesion detectability and diagnostic confidence for D710.

Conclusions: The combination of DLE and DLT increased diagnostic confidence and lesion detectability compared to ToF-BSREM images. As DLE + DLT used input OSEM images, and because DL inferencing was fast, there was a significant decrease in overall reconstruction time. This could have applications to total body PET.

TITLE: Evaluation of a respiratory motion-corrected image reconstruction algorithm in 2-[18F]FDG and [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-NOC PET/CT: impacts on image quality and tumor quantification

AUTHORS: Qing-Le Meng, Rui Yang, Run-Ze Wu, Lei Xu, Hao Liu, Gang Yang, Yun Dong, Feng Wang, Zhengguo Chen, Hongbing Jiang

JOURNAL: Quantitative imaging in medicine and surgery

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Background: Respiratory motions may cause artifacts on positron emission tomography (PET) images that degrade image quality and quantification accuracy. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of a respiratory motion-corrected image reconstruction (MCIR) algorithm on image quality and tumor quantification compared with nongated/nonmotion-corrected reconstruction.

Methods: We used a phantom consisting of 5 motion spheres immersed in a chamber driven by a motor. The spheres and the background chamber were filled with 18F solution at a sphere-to-background ratio of 5:1. We enrolled 42 and 16 patients undergoing 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose {2-[18F]FDG} and68Ga-labeled [1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid]-1-Nal3-octreotide {[68Ga]Ga-DOTA-NOC} PET/computed tomography (CT) from whom 74 and 30 lesions were segmented, respectively. Three reconstructions were performed: data-driven gating-based motion correction (DDGMC), external vital signal module-based motion correction (VSMMC), and noncorrection reconstruction. The standardized uptake values (SUVs) and the volume of the spheres and the lesions were measured and compared among the 3 reconstruction groups. The image noise in the liver was measured, and the visual image quality of motion artifacts was scored by radiologists in the patient study.

Results: In the phantom study, the spheres' SUVs increased by 26-36%, and the volumes decreased by 35-38% in DDGMC and VSMMC compared with the noncorrection group. In the 2-[18F]FDG PET patient study, the lesions' SUVs had a median increase of 10.87-12.65% while the volumes had a median decrease of 14.88-15.18% in DDGMC and VSMMC compared with those of noncorrection. In the [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-NOC PET patient study, the lesions' SUVs increased by 14.23-15.45%, and the volumes decreased by 19.11-20.94% in DDGMC and VSMMC. The image noise in the liver was equal between the DDGMC, VSMMC, and noncorrection groups. Radiologists found improved image quality in more than 45% of the cases in DDGMC and VSMMC compared with the noncorrection group. There was no statistically significant difference in SUVs, volumes, or visual image quality scores between DDGMC and VSMMC.

Conclusions: MCIR improves tumor quantification accuracy and visual image quality by reducing respiratory motion artifacts without compromised image noise performance or elongated acquisition time in 2-[18F]FDG and [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-NOC PET/CT tumor imaging. The performance of DDG-driven MCIR is as good as that of the external device-driven solution.

TITLE: Modular GAN: positron emission tomography image reconstruction using two generative adversarial networks

AUTHORS: Rajat Vashistha, Viktor Vegh, Hamed Moradi, Amanda Hammond, Kieran O'Brien, David Reutens

JOURNAL: Frontiers in radiology

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Introduction: The reconstruction of PET images involves converting sinograms, which represent the measured counts of radioactive emissions using detector rings encircling the patient, into meaningful images. However, the quality of PET data acquisition is impacted by physical factors, photon count statistics and detector characteristics, which affect the signal-to-noise ratio, resolution and quantitative accuracy of the resulting images. To address these influences, correction methods have been developed to mitigate each of these issues separately. Recently, generative adversarial networks (GANs) based on machine learning have shown promise in learning the complex mapping between acquired PET data and reconstructed tomographic images. This study aims to investigate the properties of training images that contribute to GAN performance when non-clinical images are used for training. Additionally, we describe a method to correct common PET imaging artefacts without relying on patient-specific anatomical images.

Methods: The modular GAN framework includes two GANs. Module 1, resembling Pix2pix architecture, is trained on non-clinical sinogram-image pairs. Training data are optimised by considering image properties defined by metrics. The second module utilises adaptive instance normalisation and style embedding to enhance the quality of images from Module 1. Additional perceptual and patch-based loss functions are employed in training both modules. The performance of the new framework was compared with that of existing methods, (filtered backprojection (FBP) and ordered subset expectation maximisation (OSEM) without and with point spread function (OSEM-PSF)) with respect to correction for attenuation, patient motion and noise in simulated, NEMA phantom and human imaging data. Evaluation metrics included structural similarity (SSIM), peak-signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), relative root mean squared error (rRMSE) for simulated data, and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) for NEMA phantom and human data.

Results: For simulated test data, the performance of the proposed framework was both qualitatively and quantitatively superior to that of FBP and OSEM. In the presence of noise, Module 1 generated images with a SSIM of 0.48 and higher. These images exhibited coarse structures that were subsequently refined by Module 2, yielding images with an SSIM higher than 0.71 (at least 22% higher than OSEM). The proposed method was robust against noise and motion. For NEMA phantoms, it achieved higher CNR values than OSEM. For human images, the CNR in brain regions was significantly higher than that of FBP and OSEM (p< 0.05, pairedt-test). The CNR of images reconstructed with OSEM-PSF was similar to those reconstructed using the proposed method.

Conclusion: The proposed image reconstruction method can produce PET images with artefact correction.

TITLE: Single-Subject Deep-Learning Image Reconstruction with a Neural Optimization Transfer Algorithm for PET-enabled Dual-Energy CT Imaging

AUTHORS: Siqi Li, Yansong Zhu, Benjamin A Spencer, Guobao Wang

JOURNAL: ArXiv

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Combining dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) with positron emission tomography (PET) offers many potential clinical applications but typically requires expensive hardware upgrades or increases radiation doses on PET/CT scanners due to an extra X-ray CT scan. The recent PET-enabled DECT method allows DECT imaging on PET/CT without requiring a second X-ray CT scan. It combines the already existing X-ray CT image with a 511 keV \gamma-ray CT (gCT) image reconstructed from time-of-flight PET emission data. A kernelized framework has been developed for reconstructing gCT image but this method has not fully exploited the potential of prior knowledge. Use of deep neural networks may explore the power of deep learning in this application. However, common approaches require a large database for training, which is impractical for a new imaging method like PET-enabled DECT. Here, we propose a single-subject method by using neural-network representation as a deep coefficient prior to improving gCT image reconstruction without population-based pre-training. The resulting optimization problem becomes the tomographic estimation of nonlinear neural-network parameters from gCT projection data. This complicated problem can be efficiently solved by utilizing the optimization transfer strategy with quadratic surrogates. Each iteration of the proposed neural optimization transfer algorithm includes: PET activity image update; gCT image update; and least-square neural-network learning in the gCT image domain. This algorithm is guaranteed to monotonically increase the data likelihood. Results from computer simulation, real phantom data and real patient data have demonstrated that the proposed method can significantly improve gCT image quality and consequent multi-material decomposition as compared to other methods.

TITLE: Validation of a data-driven motion-compensated PET brain image reconstruction algorithm in clinical patients using four radiotracers

AUTHORS: Ole L Munk, Anders B Rodell, Patricia B Danielsen, Josefine R Madsen, Mie T Sørensen, Niels Okkels, Jacob Horsager, Katrine B Andersen, Per Borghammer, Joel Aanerud, Judson Jones, Inki Hong, Sven Zuehlsdorff

JOURNAL: EJNMMI physics

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Patients with dementia symptoms often struggle to limit movements during PET examinations, necessitating motion compensation in brain PET imaging to ensure the high image quality needed for diagnostic accuracy. This study validates a data-driven motion-compensated (MoCo) PET brain image reconstruction algorithm that corrects head motion by integrating the detected motion frames and their associated rigid body transformations into the iterative image reconstruction. Validation was conducted using phantom scans, healthy volunteers, and clinical patients using four radiotracers with distinct tracer activity distributions.

Methods: We conducted technical validation experiments of the algorithm using Hoffman brain phantom scans during a series of controlled movements, followed by two blinded reader studies assessing image quality between standard images and MoCo images in 38 clinical patients receiving dementia scans with [18F]Fluorodeoxyglucose, [18F]N-(3-iodopro-2E-enyl)-2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(4'-methylphenyl)-nortropane, [18F]flutemetamol, and a research group comprising 25 elderly subjects scanned with [18F]fluoroethoxybenzovesamicol.

Results: The Hoffman brain phantom study demonstrated the algorithm's capability to detect and correct for even minimal movements, 1-mm translations and 1⁰ rotations, applied to the phantom. Within the clinical cohort, where standard images were deemed suboptimal or non-diagnostic, all MoCo images were classified as having acceptable diagnostic quality. In the research cohort, MoCo images consistently matched or surpassed the standard image quality even in cases with minimal head movement, and the MoCo algorithm never led to degraded image quality.

Conclusion: The PET brain MoCo reconstruction algorithm was robust and worked well for four different tracers with markedly different uptake patterns. Moco images markedly improved the image quality for patients who were unable to lie still during a PET examination and obviated the need for any repeat scans. Thus, the method was clinically feasible and has the potential for improving diagnostic accuracy.

TITLE: Fast PET Reconstruction with Variance Reduction and Prior-Aware Preconditioning

AUTHORS: Matthias J Ehrhardt, Zeljko Kereta, Georg Schramm

JOURNAL: ArXiv

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
We investigate subset-based optimization methods for positron emission tomography (PET) image reconstruction incorporating a regularizing prior. PET reconstruction methods that use a prior, such as the relative difference prior (RDP), are of particular relevance, as they are widely used in clinical practice and have been shown to outperform conventional early-stopped and post-smoothed ordered subsets expectation maximization (OSEM). Our study evaluates these methods on both simulated data and real brain PET scans from the 2024 PET Rapid Image Reconstruction Challenge (PETRIC), where the main objective was to achieve RDP-regularized reconstructions as fast as possible, making it an ideal benchmark. Our key finding is that incorporating the effect of the prior into the preconditioner is crucial for ensuring fast and stable convergence. In extensive simulation experiments, we compare several stochastic algorithms-including Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Stochastic Averaged Gradient Amelioré (SAGA), and Stochastic Variance Reduced Gradient (SVRG)-under various algorithmic design choices and evaluate their performance for varying count levels and regularization strengths. The results show that SVRG and SAGA outperformed SGD, with SVRG demonstrating a slight overall advantage. The insights gained from these simulations directly contributed to the design of our submitted algorithms, which formed the basis of the winning contribution to the PETRIC 2024 challenge.

TITLE: Prior information-guided reconstruction network for positron emission tomography images

AUTHORS: Zhiyuan Liu, Bo Wang, Huihui Ye, Huafeng Liu

JOURNAL: Quantitative imaging in medicine and surgery

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Background: Deep learning has recently shown great potential in medical image reconstruction tasks. For positron emission tomography (PET) images, the direct reconstruction from raw data to radioactivity images using deep learning without any constraint may lead to the production of nonexistent structures. The aim of this study was to specifically develop and test a flexibly deep learning-based reconstruction network guided by any form of prior knowledge to achieve high quality and high reliability reconstruction.

Methods: We developed a novel prior information-guided reconstruction network (PIGRN) with a dual-channel generator and a 2-scale discriminator based on a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN). Besides the raw data channel, an additional channel is provided in the generator for prior information (PI) to guide the training phase. The PI can be reconstructed images obtained via conventional methods, nuclear medical images from other modalities, attenuation correction maps from time-of-flight-PET (TOF-PET) data, or any other physical parameters. For this study, the reconstructed images generated by filtered back projection (FBP) were chosen as the input of the additional channel. To improve the image quality, a 2-scale discriminator was adopted which can focus on both the coarse and fine field of the reconstruction images. Experiments were carried out on both a simulation dataset and a real Sprague Dawley (SD) rat dataset.

Results: Two classic deep learning-based reconstruction networks, including U-Net and Deep-PET, were compared in our study. Compared with these two methods, our method could provide much higher quality PET image reconstruction in the study of the simulation dataset. The peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) value reached 31.8498, and the structure similarity index measure (SSIM) value reached 0.9754. The real study on SD rats indicated that the proposed network also has strong generalization ability.

Conclusions: The flexible PIGRN based on cGAN for PET images combines both raw data and PI. The results of comparison experiments and a generalization experiment based on simulation and SD rat datasets demonstrated that the proposed PIGRN has the ability to improve image quality and has strong generalization ability.

TITLE: Automatic head and neck tumor segmentation through deep learning and Bayesian optimization on three-dimensional medical images

AUTHORS: Zachariah Douglas, Abdur Rahman, William Neil Duggar, Haifeng Wang

JOURNAL: Computers in biology and medicine

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Medical imaging constitutes critical information in the diagnostic and prognostic evaluation of patients, as it serves to uncover a broad spectrum of pathologies and deviances. Clinical practitioners who carry out medical image screening are primarily reliant on their knowledge and experience for disease diagnosis. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) hold the potential to serve as a formidable decision-support tool in the realm of medical image analysis due to their high capacity to extract hierarchical features and effectuate direct classification and segmentation from image data. However, CNNs contain a myriad of hyperparameters and optimizing these hyperparameters poses a major obstacle to the effective implementation of CNNs. In this work, a two-phase Bayesian Optimization-derived Scheduling (BOS) approach is proposed for hyperparameter optimization for the head and cancerous tissue segmentation tasks. We proposed this two-phase BOS approach to incorporate both rapid convergences in the first training phase and slower (but without overfitting) improvements in the last training phase. Furthermore, we found that batch size and learning rate have a significant impact on the training process, but optimizing them separately can lead to sub-optimal hyperparameter combinations. Therefore, batch size and learning rate have been coupled as the batch size to learning rate (B2L) ratio and utilized in the optimization process to optimize both simultaneously. The optimized hyperparameters have been tested for a three-dimensional V-Net model with computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography (PET) scans to segment and classify cancerous and noncancerous tissues. The results of 10-fold cross-validation indicate that the optimal batch size to learning rate (B2L) ratio for each phase of the training method can improve the overall medical image segmentation performance.

TITLE: Comparison of three freeware software packages for 18F-FDG PET texture feature calculation

AUTHORS: Michele Larobina, Rosario Megna, Raffaele Solla

JOURNAL: Japanese journal of radiology

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: To compare texture feature estimates obtained from18F-FDG-PET images using three different software packages.

Methods: PET images from 15 patients with head and neck cancer were processed with three different freeware software: CGITA, LIFEx, and Metavol. For each lesion, 38 texture features were extracted from each software package. To evaluate the statistical agreement among the features across packages a non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test was used. Differences in the features between each couple of software were assessed using a subsequent Dunn test. Correlation between texture features was evaluated via the Spearman coefficient.

Results: Twenty-three of 38 features showed a significant agreement across the three software (P < 0.05). The agreement was better between LIFEx vs. Metavol (36 of 38) and worse between CGITA and Metavol (24 of 38), and CGITA vs. LIFEx (23 of 38). All features resulted correlated (ρ > = 0.70, P < 0.001) in comparing LIFEx vs. Metavol. Seven of 38 features were found not in agreement and slightly or not correlated (ρ < 0.70, P < 0.001) in comparing CGITA vs. LIFEx, and CGITA vs. Metavol.

Conclusion: Some texture discrepancies across software packages exist. Our findings reinforce the need to continue the standardization process, and to succeed in building a reference dataset to be used for comparisons.

TITLE: A heterogeneous phantom study for investigating the stability of PET images radiomic features with varying reconstruction settings

AUTHORS: Emad Alsyed, Rhodri Smith, Lee Bartley, Christopher Marshall, Emiliano Spezi

JOURNAL: Frontiers in nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
The purpose of this work was to assess the capability of radiomic features in distinguishing PET image regions with different uptake patterns. Furthermore, we assessed the stability of PET radiomic features with varying image reconstruction settings. An in-house phantom was designed and constructed, consisting of homogenous and heterogenous artificial phantom inserts. Four artificially constructed inserts were placed into a water filled phantom and filled with varying levels of radioactivity to simulate homogeneous and heterogeneous uptake patterns. The phantom was imaged for 80 min. PET images were reconstructed whilst varying reconstruction parameters. The parameters adjusted included, number of ordered subsets, number of iterations, use of time-of-flight and filter cut off. Regions of interest (ROI) were established by segmentation of the phantom inserts from the reconstructed images. In total seventy eight 3D radiomic features for each ROI with unique reconstructed parameters were extracted. The Friedman test was used to determine the statistical power of each radiomic feature in differentiating phantom inserts with different hetero/homogeneous configurations. The Coefficient of Variation (COV) of each feature, with respect to the reconstruction setting was used to determine feature stability. Forty three out of seventy eight radiomic features were found to be stable (COV≤5%) against all reconstruction settings. To provide any utility, stable features are required to differentiate between regions with different hetro/homogeneity. Of the forty three stable features, fifteen (35%) features showed a statistically significant difference between the artificially constructed inserts. Such features included GLCM (Difference average, Difference entropy, Dissimilarity and Inverse difference), GLRL (Long run emphasis, Grey level non uniformity and Run percentage) and NGTDM (Complexity and Strength). The finding of this work suggests that radiomic features are capable of distinguishing between radioactive distribution patterns that demonstrate different levels of heterogeneity. Therefore, radiomic features could serve as an adjuvant diagnostic tool along with traditional imaging. However, the choice of the radiomic features needs to account for variability introduced when different reconstruction settings are used. Standardization of PET image reconstruction settings across sites performing radiomic analysis in multi-centre trials should be considered.

TITLE: Sensitivity of an AI method for [18F]FDG PET/CT outcome prediction of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients to image reconstruction protocols

JOURNAL: EJNMMI research

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Background: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), applied to baseline [18F]-FDG PET/CT maximum intensity projections (MIPs), show potential for treatment outcome prediction in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The aim of this study is to investigate the robustness of CNN predictions to different image reconstruction protocols. Baseline [18F]FDG PET/CT scans were collected from 20 DLBCL patients. EARL1, EARL2 and high-resolution (HR) protocols were applied per scan, generating three images with different image qualities. Image-based transformation was applied by blurring EARL2 and HR images to generate EARL1 compliant images using a Gaussian filter of 5 and 7 mm, respectively. MIPs were generated for each of the reconstructions, before and after image transformation. An in-house developed CNN predicted the probability of tumor progression within 2 years for each MIP. The difference in probabilities per patient was then calculated between both EARL2 and HR with respect to EARL1 (delta probabilities or ΔP). We compared these to the probabilities obtained after aligning the data with ComBat using the difference in median and interquartile range (IQR).

Results: CNN probabilities were found to be sensitive to different reconstruction protocols (EARL2 ΔP: median = 0.09, interquartile range (IQR) = [0.06, 0.10] and HR ΔP: median = 0.1, IQR = [0.08, 0.16]). Moreover, higher resolution images (EARL2 and HR) led to higher probability values. After image-based and ComBat transformation, an improved agreement of CNN probabilities among reconstructions was found for all patients. This agreement was slightly better after image-based transformation (transformed EARL2 ΔP: median = 0.022, IQR = [0.01, 0.02] and transformed HR ΔP: median = 0.029, IQR = [0.01, 0.03]).

Conclusion: Our CNN-based outcome predictions are affected by the applied reconstruction protocols, yet in a predictable manner. Image-based harmonization is a suitable approach to harmonize CNN predictions across image reconstruction protocols.

TITLE: Noninvasive Quantification of Glucose Metabolism in Mice Myocardium Using the Spline Reconstruction Technique

AUTHORS: Alexandros Vrachliotis, Anastasios Gaitanis, Nicholas E Protonotarios, George A Kastis, Lena Costaridou

JOURNAL: Journal of imaging

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
The spline reconstruction technique (SRT) is a fast algorithm based on a novel numerical implementation of an analytic representation of the inverse Radon transform. The purpose of this study was to compare the SRT, filtered back-projection (FBP), and the Tera-Tomo 3D algorithm for various iteration numbers, using small-animal dynamic PET data obtained from a Mediso nanoScan®PET/CT scanner. For this purpose, Patlak graphical kinetic analysis was employed to noninvasively quantify the myocardial metabolic rate of glucose (MRGlu) in seven male C57BL/6 mice (n=7). All analytic reconstructions were performed via software for tomographic image reconstruction. The analysis of all PET-reconstructed images was conducted with PMOD software (version 3.506, PMOD Technologies LLC, Fällanden, Switzerland) using the inferior vena cava as the image-derived input function. Statistical significance was determined by employing the one-way analysis of variance test. The results revealed that the differences between the values of MRGlu obtained via SRT versus FBP, and the variants of he Tera-Tomo 3D algorithm were not statistically significant (p> 0.05). Overall, the SRT appears to perform similarly to the other algorithms investigated, providing a valid alternative analytic method for preclinical dynamic PET studies.

TITLE: OMEGA-open-source emission tomography software

AUTHORS: V-V Wettenhovi, M Vauhkonen, V Kolehmainen

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
In this paper we present OMEGA, an open-source software, for efficient and fast image reconstruction in positron emission tomography (PET). OMEGA uses the scripting language of MATLAB and GNU Octave allowing reconstruction of PET data with a MATLAB or GNU Octave interface. The goal of OMEGA is to allow easy and fast reconstruction of any PET data, and to provide a computationally efficient, easy-access platform for development of new PET algorithms with built-in forward and backward projection operations available to the user as a MATLAB/Octave class. OMEGA also includes direct support for GATE simulated data, facilitating easy evaluation of the new algorithms using Monte Carlo simulated PET data. OMEGA supports parallel computing by utilizing OpenMP for CPU implementations and OpenCL for GPU allowing any hardware to be used. OMEGA includes built-in function for the computation of normalization correction and allows several other corrections to be applied such as attenuation, randoms or scatter. OMEGA includes several different maximum-likelihood and maximum a posteriori (MAP) algorithms with several different priors. The user can also input their own priors to the built-in MAP functions. The image reconstruction in OMEGA can be computed either by using an explicitly computed system matrix or with a matrix-free formalism, where the latter can be accelerated with OpenCL. We provide an overview on the software and present some examples utilizing the different features of the software.

TITLE: An analytical approach to predict 3D positron emitter distribution in carbon ion therapy

AUTHORS: Tianxue Du, Julia Bauer, Katia Parodi, Marco Pinto

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Objective.Carbon ion therapy could benefit from range verification due to its sensitivity to range uncertainties. Positron emission tomography (PET) aids in this and comparing PET signals to a predicted positron emitter distribution (PED) is one viable approach. Monte Carlo (MC) simulations are one way to predict PED but are computationally intensive and time-consuming. To address this, an analytical approach was previously suggested to predict 1D PED from depth dose profiles. Here we aim to develop a computational framework for 3D PED prediction in carbon ion therapy, building on the 1D approach to provide a faster method than MC simulations, with potential for integration into treatment planning systems (TPS).Approach.The 1D approach was revised by considering more PEs channels and introducing new modeling functions. A mapping process for handling longitudinal heterogeneity effects in projectile PED was developed. Then, a dedicated framework for 3D PED generation based on a pencil beam algorithm (PBA) and the updated 1D method was proposed. Validation was performed throughin-silicostudies against MC calculations for several phantoms as well as realistic computed tomography scans from patient data.Main results.For range assessment, the differences between distal fall-off positions of predicted and simulated 1D PED profiles were calculated to be below 0.8 mm for all validation cases. The comparison of predicted 3D PED with simulated results was performed by global gamma index analysis using the 2%/2 mm and 1%/1 mm criteria. For patient cases, the passing rates for 1%/1 mm criteria were above 95%.Significance.These results demonstrated the capability of our approach to predict 3D PED with good accuracy in terms of range and magnitude, paving the way to future implementation in a TPS, which commonly relies on PBA for12C ions. Moreover, a significant speed-up compared to MC simulations was achieved, with future speed-optimized implementations.

TITLE: Demonstration of in-vivo simultaneous 3D imaging with 18F-FDG and Na131I using Compton-PET system

AUTHORS: Donghwan Kim, Linlin Yan, Kenji Shimazoe, Hiroyuki Takahashi, Kenichiro Ogane, Masao Yoshino, Kei Kamada, Mizuki Uenomachi

JOURNAL: Scientific reports

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Simultaneous imaging of the SPECT tracer131I and PET tracer18F is important in the diagnosis of high- and low-grade thyroid cancers because high-grade thyroid cancers have high18F-FDG and low131I uptake, while low-grade thyroid cancers have high131I and low18F-FDG uptake. In this study, Na131I and18F-FDG were simultaneously imaged using the Compton-PET system, in vivo. The angular resolution and sensitivity of the Compton camera with 356 keV gamma ray measured using a133Ba point source were 12.3° and 2 × 10-5, respectively. The spatial resolution and sensitivity of PET were measured with a22Na point source. The transaxial and axial spatial resolutions of the PET at the center of the FOV were 1.15 mm and 2.04 mm, respectively. Its sensitivity was 1.2 × 10-4. In-vivo images of the18F and131I isotopes were simultaneously acquired from mice. These showed that18F-FDG was active in the heart, brown fat, and brain, while Na131I was active in the thyroid, stomach, and bladder. Artifacts were found in the Compton camera images when the activity of131I was much lower than that of18F. This study demonstrates the potential of simultaneous clinical imaging of18F and131I.

TITLE: Evaluation of synergistic image registration for motion-corrected coronary NaF-PET-MR

AUTHORS: Johannes Mayer, Yining Jin, Thomas-Heinrich Wurster, Marcus R Makowski, Christoph Kolbitsch

JOURNAL: Philosophical transactions. Series A, Mathematical, physical, and engineering sciences

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Coronary artery disease (CAD) is caused by the formation of plaques in the coronary arteries and is one of the most common cardiovascular diseases. NaF-PET can be used to assess plaque composition, which could be important for therapy planning. One of the main challenges of NaF-PET is cardiac and respiratory motion which can strongly impair diagnostic accuracy. In this study, we investigated the use of a synergistic image registration approach which combined motion-resolved MR and PET data to estimate cardiac and respiratory motion. This motion estimation could then be used to improve the NaF-PET image quality. The approach was evaluated with numerical simulations andin vivoscans of patients suffering from CAD. In numerical simulations, it was shown, that combining MR and PET information can improve the accuracy of motion estimation by more than 15%. For thein vivoscans, the synergistic image registration led to an improvement in uptake visualization. This is the first study to assess the benefit of combining MR and NaF-PET for cardiac and respiratory motion estimation. Further patient evaluation is required to fully evaluate the potential of this approach. This article is part of the theme issue 'Synergistic tomographic image reconstruction: part 1'.

AUTHORS: Jessica B Hopson, Sam Ellis, Anthime Flaus, Colm J McGinnity, Radhouene Neji, Andrew J Reader, Alexander Hammers

JOURNAL: IEEE transactions on radiation and plasma medical sciences

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Reduced dose Positron Emission Tomography (PET) lowers the radiation dose to patients and reduces costs. Lower count data, however, degrades reconstructed image quality. Advanced reconstruction methods help mitigate image quality losses, but it is important to assess the resulting images from a clinical perspective. Two experienced clinicians assessed four PET reconstruction algorithms for [18F]FDG brain data, compared to a clinical standard reference (Maximum-Likelihood Expectation-Maximization (MLEM)), based on seven clinical image quality metrics: global quality rating, pattern recognition, diagnostic confidence (all on a scale of 0-4), sharpness, caudate-putamen separation, noise, and contrast (on a scale between 0-2). The reconstruction methods assessed were a guided and unguided version of self-supervised maximuma posterioriEM (MAPEM) (where the guidance case used the patient's MR image to control the smoothness penalty). For 3 of the 11 patient datasets reconstructed, post-smoothed versions of the MAPEM reconstruction were also considered, where the smoothing was with the point-spread-function used in the resolution modelling. Statistically significant improvements were observed in sharpness, caudate-putamen separation, and contrast for self-supervised MR-guided MAPEM compared to MLEM. For example, MLEM scored between 1-1.1 out of 2 for sharpness, caudate-putamen separation and contrast, whereas self-supervised MR-guided MAPEM scored between 1.5-1.75. In addition to the clinical evaluation, pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) were used to assess the image quality of a further 62 images. The CNNs demonstrated similar trends to the clinician, showing their potential as automated standalone observers. Both the clinical and CNN assessments suggest when using only 5% of the standard injected dose, self-supervised MR-guided MAPEM reconstruction matches the 100% MLEM case for overall performance. This makes the images far more clinically useful than standard MLEM.

TITLE: Noise reduction with cross-tracer and cross-protocol deep transfer learning for low-dose PET

AUTHORS: Hui Liu, Jing Wu, Wenzhuo Lu, John A Onofrey, Yi-Hwa Liu, Chi Liu

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Previous studies have demonstrated the feasibility of reducing noise with deep learning-based methods for low-dose fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET). This work aimed to investigate the feasibility of noise reduction for tracers without sufficient training datasets using a deep transfer learning approach, which can utilize existing networks trained by the widely available FDG datasets. In this study, the deep transfer learning strategy based on a fully 3D patch-based U-Net was investigated on a18F-fluoromisonidazole (18F-FMISO) dataset using single-bed scanning and a68Ga-DOTATATE dataset using whole-body scanning. The datasets of18F-FDG by single-bed scanning and whole-body scanning were used to obtain pre-trained U-Nets separately for subsequent cross-tracer and cross-protocol transfer learning. The full-dose PET images were used as the labels while low-dose PET images from 10% counts were used as the inputs. Three types of U-Nets were obtained: a U-Net trained by FDG dataset, a pre-trained FDG U-Net fine-tuned by another less-available tracer (FMISO/DOATATE), and a U-Net completely trained by a large number of less-available tracer datasets (FMISO/DOATATE), used as the reference U-Net. The denoising performance of the three types of U-Nets was evaluated on single-bed18F-FMISO and whole-body68Ga-DOTATATE separately and compared using normalized root-mean-square error (NRMSE), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and relative bias of region of interest (ROI). For cross-tracer transfer learning, all the U-Nets provided denoised images with similar quality for both tracers. There was no significant difference in terms of NRMSE and SNR when comparing the former two U-Nets with the reference U-Net. The ROI biases for these U-Nets were similar. For cross-tracer and cross-protocol transfer learning, the pre-trained single-bed FDG U-Net fine-tuned by whole-body DOTATATE data provided the most consistent images with the reference U-Net. Fine-tuning significantly reduced the NRMSE and the ROI bias and improved the SNR when comparing the fine-tuned U-Net with the U-Net trained by single-bed FDG only (NRMSE: 96.3% ± 21.1% versus 120.6% ± 18.5%, ROI bias: -10.5% ± 13.0% versus -14.7% ± 6.4%, SNR: 4.2 ± 1.4 versus 3.9 ± 1.6, for fine-tuned U-Net and the U-Net trained by single-bed FDG, respectively, with p < 0.01 in all cases). This work demonstrated that it is feasible to utilize existing networks well-trained by FDG datasets to reduce the noise for other less-available tracers and other scanning protocols by using the fine-tuning strategy.

TITLE: Memory-Efficient Training for Fully Unrolled Deep Learned PET Image Reconstruction with Iteration-Dependent Targets

AUTHORS: Guillaume Corda-D'Incan, Julia A Schnabel, Andrew J Reader

JOURNAL: IEEE transactions on radiation and plasma medical sciences

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
We propose a new version of the forward-backward splitting expectation-maximisation network (FBSEM-Net) along with a new memory-efficient training method enabling the training of fully unrolled implementations of 3D FBSEM-Net. FBSEM-Net unfolds the maximuma posterioriexpectation-maximisation algorithm and replaces the regularisation step by a residual convolutional neural network. Both the gradient of the prior and the regularisation strength are learned from training data. In this new implementation, three modifications of the original framework are included. First, iteration-dependent networks are used to have a customised regularisation at each iteration. Second, iteration-dependent targets and losses are introduced so that the regularised reconstruction matches the reconstruction of noise-free data at every iteration. Third, sequential training is performed, making training of large unrolled networks far more memory efficient and feasible. Since sequential training permits unrolling a high number of iterations, there is no need for artificial use of the regularisation step as a leapfrogging acceleration. The results obtained on 2D and 3D simulated data show that FBSEM-Net using iteration-dependent targets and losses improves the consistency in the optimisation of the network parameters over different training runs. We also found that using iteration-dependent targets increases the generalisation capabilities of the network. Furthermore, unrolled networks using iteration-dependent regularisation allowed a slight reduction in reconstruction error compared to using a fixed regularisation network at each iteration. Finally, we demonstrate that sequential training successfully addresses potentially serious memory issues during the training of deep unrolled networks. In particular, it enables the training of 3D fully unrolled FBSEM-Net, not previously feasible, by reducing the memory usage by up to 98% compared to a conventional end-to-end training. We also note that the truncation of the backpropagation (due to sequential training) does not notably impact the network's performance compared to conventional training with a full backpropagation through the entire network.

TITLE: 3D lymphoma segmentation on PET/CT images via multi-scale information fusion with cross-attention

AUTHORS: Huan Huang, Liheng Qiu, Shenmiao Yang, Longxi Li, Jiaofen Nan, Yanting Li, Chuang Han, Fubao Zhu, Chen Zhao, Weihua Zhou

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Background: Accurate segmentation of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) lesions is challenging due to their complex patterns in medical imaging. Traditional methods often struggle to delineate these lesions accurately.

Objective: This study aims to develop a precise segmentation method for DLBCL using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) and computed tomography (CT) images.

Methods: We propose a 3D segmentation method based on an encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder incorporates a dual-branch design based on the shifted window transformer to extract features from both PET and CT modalities. To enhance feature integration, we introduce a multi-scale information fusion (MSIF) module that performs multi-scale feature fusion using cross-attention mechanisms with a shifted window framework. A gated neural network within the MSIF module dynamically adjusts feature weights to balance the contributions from each modality. The model is optimized using the dice similarity coefficient (DSC) loss function, minimizing discrepancies between the model prediction and ground truth. Additionally, we computed the total metabolic tumor volume (TMTV) and performed statistical analyses on the results.

Results: The model was trained and validated on a private dataset of 165 DLBCL patients and a publicly available dataset (autoPET) containing 145 PET/CT scans of lymphoma patients. Both datasets were analyzed using five-fold cross-validation. On the private dataset, our model achieved a DSC of 0.7512, sensitivity of 0.7548, precision of 0.7611, an average surface distance (ASD) of 3.61 mm, and a Hausdorff distance at the 95th percentile (HD95) of 15.25 mm. On the autoPET dataset, the model achieved a DSC of 0.7441, sensitivity of 0.7573, precision of 0.7427, ASD of 5.83 mm, and HD95 of 21.27 mm, outperforming state-of-the-art methods (p < 0.05, t-test). For TMTV quantification, Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.91 (private dataset) and 0.86 (autoPET) were observed, with R2values of 0.89 and 0.75, respectively. Extensive ablation studies demonstrated the MSIF module's contribution to enhanced segmentation accuracy.

Conclusion: This study presents an effective automatic segmentation method for DLBCL that leverages the complementary strengths of PET and CT imaging. The method demonstrates robust performance on both private and publicly available datasets, ensuring its reliability and generalizability. Our method provides clinicians with more precise tumor delineation, which can improve the accuracy of diagnostic interpretations and assist in treatment planning for DLBCL patients. The code for the proposed method is available at https://github.com/chenzhao2023/lymphoma_seg.

Background: The indirect method for generating parametric images in positron emission tomography (PET) involves the acquisition and reconstruction of dynamic images and temporal modelling of tissue activity given a measured arterial input function. This approach is not robust, as noise in each dynamic image leads to a degradation in parameter estimation. Direct methods incorporate into the image reconstruction step both the kinetic and noise models, leading to improved parametric images. These methods require extensive computational time and large computing resources. Machine learning methods have demonstrated significant potential in overcoming these challenges. But they are limited by the requirement of a paired training dataset. A further challenge within the existing framework is the use of state-of-the-art arterial input function estimation via temporal arterial blood sampling, which is an invasive procedure, or an additional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan for selecting a region where arterial blood signal can be measured from the PET image. We propose a novel machine learning approach for reconstructing high-quality parametric brain images from histoimages produced from time-of-flight PET data without requiring invasive arterial sampling, an MRI scan, or paired training data from standard field-of-view scanners.

Result: The proposed is tested on a simulated phantom and five oncological subjects undergoing an 18F-FDG-PET scan of the brain using Siemens Biograph Vision Quadra. Kinetic parameters set in the brain phantom correlated strongly with the estimated parameters (K1, k2and k3, Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.91, 0.92 and 0.93) and a mean squared error of less than 0.0004. In addition, our method significantly outperforms (p < 0.05, paired t-test) the conventional nonlinear least squares method in terms of contrast-to-noise ratio. At last, the proposed method was found to be 37% faster than the conventional method.

Conclusion: We proposed a direct non-invasive DL-based reconstruction method and produced high-quality parametric maps of the brain. The use of histoimages holds promising potential for enhancing the estimation of parametric images, an area that has not been extensively explored thus far. The proposed method can be applied to subject-specific dynamic PET data alone.

JOURNAL: EJNMMI physics

ABSTRACT:
Deep learning (DL) has a growing popularity and is a well-established method of artificial intelligence for data processing, especially for images and videos. Its applications in nuclear medicine are broad and include, among others, disease classification, image reconstruction, and image de-noising. Positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) are major image acquisition technologies in nuclear medicine. Though several studies have been conducted to apply DL in many nuclear medicine domains, such as cancer detection and classification, few studies have employed such methods for cardiovascular disease applications. The present paper reviews recent DL approaches focused on cardiac SPECT imaging. Extensive research identified fifty-five related studies, which are discussed. The review distinguishes between major application domains, including cardiovascular disease diagnosis, SPECT attenuation correction, image denoising, full-count image estimation, and image reconstruction. In addition, major findings and dominant techniques employed for the mentioned task are revealed. Current limitations of DL approaches and future research directions are discussed.

TITLE: Dose distributions of proton therapy plans are robust against lowering the resolution of CTs combined with increasing noise

AUTHORS: Carla Frensch, Claus Maximilian Bäcker, Walter Jentzen, Ann-Kristin Lüvelsmeyer, Mohammadreza Teimoorisichani, Jörg Wulff, Beate Timmermann, Christian Bäumer

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Background: Treatment planning in radiation therapy (RT) is performed on image sets acquired with commercial x-ray computed tomography (CT) scanners. Considering an increased frequency of verification scans for adaptive RT and the advent of alternatives to x-ray CTs, there is a need to review the requirements for image sets used in RT planning.

Purpose: This study aims to derive the required image quality (IQ) for the computation of the dose distribution in proton therapy (PT) regarding spatial resolution and the combination of spatial resolution and noise. The knowledge gained is used to explore the potential for dose reduction in tomography-guided PT.

Methods: Mathematical considerations indicate that the required spatial resolution for dose computation is on the scale of the set-up margins fed into the robust optimization. This hypothesis was tested by processing retrospectively 12 clinical PT cases, which reflect a variety of tumor localizations. Image sets were low-pass filtered and were made noisy in a generic manner. Dose distributions on the modified CT scans were computed with a Monte-Carlo dose engine. The similarity of these dose distributions with clinical ones was quantified with the gamma-index (1 mm/1%). The potential reduction of the x-ray exposure compared to the planning CT scan was estimated.

Results: Dose distributions within the irradiated volume were robust against low-pass filtering of the CTs with kernels up to a full-width-at-half-maximum of 4 mm, that is, the gamma pass rate (1 mm/1%) was98%. The limit of the filter width was 6 mm for brain tumors and 8 mm for targets in the abdomen. These pass rates remained approximately unchanged if a limited amount of noise was added to the CT image sets. The estimated potential reductions of the x-ray exposure were at least a factor of 20.

Conclusions: The requirements on IQ in terms of spatial resolution in combination with noise for computing the dose in PT are clearly lower than the IQ of current clinical planning. The results apply, for example, to ultra-low dose x-ray CTs, proton CTs with coarse spatial detection, and attenuation images from the joint reconstruction of time-of-flight PET scans.

AUTHORS: Shinichi Okazumi, Gaku Ohira, Koichi Hayano, Tomoyoshi Aoyagi, Shunsuke Imanishi, Hisahiro Matsubara

JOURNAL: Journal of clinical medicine

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Background:Recently, neoadjuvant therapy and the succeeding surgery for advanced esophageal cancer have been evaluated. In particular, the response to the therapy has been found to affect surgical outcomes, and thus a precise evaluation of treatment effect is important for this strategy. In this study, articles on qualitative diagnostic modalities to evaluate tumor activities were reviewed, and the diagnostic indices were examined.Methods:For prediction of the effect, perfusion CT and diffusion MRI were estimated. For the histological response evaluation, perfusion CT, diffusion-MRI, and FDG-PET were estimated. For downstaging evaluation of T4, tissue-selective image reconstruction using enhanced CT was estimated and diagnostic indices were reviewed.Results:The prediction of the effect using perfusion CT with 'pre CRT blood flow' and diffusion MRI with 'pre CRT ADC value'; the estimation of the histological response using perfusion CT with 'post CRT blood flow reduction, using diffusion MRI with 'post CRT ADC increasing', and using FDG-PET with 'post CRT SUV reduction'; and the downstaging evaluation of T4 using CT image reconstruction with 'fibrous changed layer' were performed well, respectively.Conclusions: Qualitative imaging modalities for prediction or response evaluation of neoadjuvant therapy for progressive esophageal cancer were useful for the decision making of the treatment strategy of the multidisciplinary treatment.

TITLE: Improved image reconstruction of 89Zr-immunoPET studies using a Bayesian penalized likelihood reconstruction algorithm

AUTHORS: Julian Kirchner, Joseph A O'Donoghue, Anton S Becker, Gary A Ulaner

JOURNAL: EJNMMI physics

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of a Bayesian penalized likelihood reconstruction algorithm (Q.Clear) for89Zr-immunoPET image reconstruction and its potential to improve image quality and reduce the administered activity of89Zr-immunoPET tracers.

Methods: Eight89Zr-immunoPET whole-body PET/CT scans from three89Zr-immunoPET clinical trials were selected for analysis. On average, patients were imaged 6.3 days (range 5.0-8.0 days) after administration of 69 MBq (range 65-76 MBq) of [89Zr]Zr-DFO-daratumumab, [89Zr]Zr-DFO-pertuzumab, or [89Zr]Zr-DFO-trastuzumab. List-mode PET data was retrospectively reconstructed using Q.Clear with incremental β-values from 150 to 7200, as well as standard ordered-subset expectation maximization (OSEM) reconstruction (2-iterations, 16-subsets, a 6.4-mm Gaussian transaxial filter, "heavy" z-axis filtering and all manufacturers' corrections active). Reduced activities were simulated by discarding 50% and 75% of original counts in each list mode stream. All reconstructed PET images were scored for image quality and lesion detectability using a 5-point scale. SUVmaxfor normal liver and sites of disease and liver signal-to-noise ratio were measured.

Results: Q.Clear reconstructions with β = 3600 provided the highest scores for image quality. Images reconstructed with β-values of 3600 or 5200 using only 50% or 25% of the original counts provided comparable or better image quality scores than standard OSEM reconstruction images using 100% of counts.

Conclusion: The Bayesian penalized likelihood reconstruction algorithm Q.Clear improved the quality of89Zr-immunoPET images. This could be used in future studies to improve image quality and/or decrease the administered activity of89Zr-immunoPET tracers.

TITLE: Combatting the effect of image reconstruction settings on lymphoma [18F]FDG PET metabolic tumor volume assessment using various segmentation methods

AUTHORS: Maria C Ferrández, Jakoba J Eertink, Sandeep S V Golla, Sanne E Wiegers, Gerben J C Zwezerijnen, Simone Pieplenbosch, Josée M Zijlstra, Ronald Boellaard

JOURNAL: EJNMMI research

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Background: [18F]FDG PET-based metabolic tumor volume (MTV) is a promising prognostic marker for lymphoma patients. The aim of this study is to assess the sensitivity of several MTV segmentation methods to variations in image reconstruction methods and the ability of ComBat to improve MTV reproducibility.

Methods: Fifty-six lesions were segmented from baseline [18F]FDG PET scans of 19 lymphoma patients. For each scan, EARL1 and EARL2 standards and locally clinically preferred reconstruction protocols were applied. Lesions were delineated using 9 semiautomatic segmentation methods: fixed threshold based on standardized uptake value (SUV), (SUV = 4, SUV = 2.5), relative threshold (41% of SUVmax [41M], 50% of SUVpeak [A50P]), majority vote-based methods that select voxels detected by at least 2 (MV2) and 3 (MV3) out of the latter 4 methods, Nestle thresholding, and methods that identify the optimal method based on SUVmax (L2A, L2B). MTVs from EARL2 and locally clinically preferred reconstructions were compared to those from EARL1. Finally, different versions of ComBat were explored to harmonize the data.

Results: MTVs from the SUV4.0 method were least sensitive to the use of different reconstructions (MTV ratio: median = 1.01, interquartile range = [0.96-1.10]). After ComBat harmonization, an improved agreement of MTVs among different reconstructions was found for most segmentation methods. The regular implementation of ComBat ('Regular ComBat') using non-transformed distributions resulted in less accurate and precise MTV alignments than a version using log-transformed datasets ('Log-transformed ComBat').

Conclusion: MTV depends on both segmentation method and reconstruction methods. ComBat reduces reconstruction dependent MTV variability, especially when log-transformation is used to account for the non-normal distribution of MTVs.

TITLE: Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in Nuclear Medicine: Future Perspectives

AUTHORS: Robert Seifert, Manuel Weber, Emre Kocakavuk, Christoph Rischpler, David Kersting

JOURNAL: Seminars in nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Artificial intelligence and machine learning based approaches are increasingly finding their way into various areas of nuclear medicine imaging. With the technical development of new methods and the expansion to new fields of application, this trend is likely to become even more pronounced in future. Possible means of application range from automated image reading and classification to correlation with clinical outcomes and to technological applications in image processing and reconstruction. In the context of tumor imaging, that is, predominantly FDG or PSMA PET imaging but also bone scintigraphy, artificial intelligence approaches can be used to quantify the whole-body tumor volume, for the segmentation and classification of pathological foci or to facilitate the diagnosis of micro-metastases. More advanced applications aim at the correlation of image features that are derived by artificial intelligence with clinical endpoints, for example, whole-body tumor volume with overall survival. In nuclear medicine imaging of benign diseases, artificial intelligence methods are predominantly used for automated and/or facilitated image classification and clinical decision making. Automated feature selection, segmentation and classification of myocardial perfusion scintigraphy can help in identifying patients that would benefit from intervention and to forecast clinical prognosis. Automated reporting of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease might be extended to early diagnosis-being of special interest, if targeted treatment options might become available. Technological approaches include artificial intelligence-based attenuation correction of PET images, image reconstruction or anatomical landmarking. Attenuation correction is of special interest for avoiding the need of a coregistered CT scan, in the process of image reconstruction artefacts might be reduced, or ultra low-dose PET images might be denoised. The development of accurate ultra low-dose PET imaging might broaden the method's applicability, for example, toward oncologic PET screening. Most artificial intelligence approaches in nuclear medicine imaging are still in early stages of development, further improvements are necessary for broad clinical applications. In this review, we describe the current trends in the context fields of body oncology, cardiac imaging, and neuroimaging while an additional section puts emphasis on technological trends. Our aim is not only to describe currently available methods, but also to place a special focus on the description of possible future developments.

TITLE: Evaluation of STIR Library Adapted for PET Scanners with Non-Cylindrical Geometry

AUTHORS: Viet Dao, Ekaterina Mikhaylova, Max L Ahnen, Jannis Fischer, Kris Thielemans, Charalampos Tsoumpas

JOURNAL: Journal of imaging

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Software for Tomographic Image Reconstruction (STIR) is an open source C++ library used to reconstruct single photon emission tomography and positron emission tomography (PET) data. STIR has an experimental scanner geometry modelling feature to accurately model detector placement. In this study, we test and improve this new feature using several types of data: Monte Carlo simulations and measured phantom data acquired from a dedicated brain PET prototype scanner. The results show that the new geometry class applied to non-cylindrical PET scanners improved spatial resolution, uniformity, and image contrast. These are directly observed in the reconstructions of small features in the test quality phantom. Overall, we conclude that the revised "BlocksOnCylindrical" class will be a valuable addition to the next STIR software release with adjustments of existing features (Single Scatter Simulation, forward projection, attenuation corrections) to "BlocksOnCylindrical".

TITLE: Phantom-based investigation of block sequential regularised expectation maximisation (BSREM) reconstruction for zirconium-89 PET-CT for varied count levels

AUTHORS: Lara M Bonney, Matthew D Walker, Daniel R McGowan

JOURNAL: EJNMMI physics

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Background: Zirconium-89 (Zr-89) PET tracers have become increasingly significant in the field of nuclear medicine due to their 3-day physical half-life, allowing for the study of dynamic biological processes over relatively long timeframes. To date there has been limited publication of studies focused on optimisation of acquisition parameters for Zr-89 PET. This paper outlines a short phantom study investigating the optimal beta regularization parameter for quantitation and noise in block sequential regularised expectation maximisation (BSREM) also known as Bayesian penalized likelihood (BPL) reconstruction, for varying image noise characteristics (acquisition duration).

Results: The choice of the beta regularisation parameter substantially impacts image quality and quantitation. For larger volumes, BSREM reconstruction enhanced image quality (lower noise) and maintained quantitation, whereas for smaller volumes quantitation worsened as compared to OSEM for high regularisation parameters.

Conclusion: Where BSREM reconstruction is used for Zr-89 images, careful attention must be paid to the choice of weighting factor, especially for quantitative clinical studies. The effect of varying beta on several measures of image quality was characterised for the case of a phantom, with the results indicating that the value of beta for optimal Zr-89 quantitation is lower than what is generally used for optimal visualisation. This work demonstrates the need for careful attention to the reconstruction methods used for quantitative imaging studies, such as those required for theragnostic imaging.

TITLE: NEMA NU 2-2018 evaluation and image quality optimization of a new generation digital 32-cm axial field-of-view Omni Legend PET-CT using a genetic evolutionary algorithm

AUTHORS: Rhodri Lyn Smith, Lee Bartley, Christopher O'Callaghan, Luiza Haberska, Chris Marshall

JOURNAL: Biomedical physics & engineering express

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
A performance evaluation was conducted on the new General Electric (GE) digital Omni Legend PET-CT system with 32 cm extended field of view. The first commercially available clinical digital bismuth germanate system. The system does not use time of flight (ToF). Testing was performed in accordance with the NEMA NU2-2018 standard. A comparison was made between two other commercial GE scanners with extended fields of view; the Discovery MI - 6 ring (ToF enabled) and the Discovery IQ (non-ToF). A genetic evolutionary algorithm was developed to optimize image reconstruction parameters from image quality assessments. The Omni demonstrated average spatial resolutions at 1 cm radial offset as 3.9 mm FWHM. The total system sensitivity at the center was 44.36 cps/kBq. The peak NECR was measured as 501 kcps at 17.8 kBq ml-1with a 35.48% scatter fraction. The maximum count-rate error below NECR peak was 5.5%. Using standard iterative reconstructions, sphere contrast recovery coefficients were from 52.7 ± 3.2% (10 mm) to 92.5 ± 2.4% (37 mm). The PET-CT co-registration accuracy was 2.4 mm. In place of ToF, the Omni employs software corrections through a pre-trained neural network (PDL) (trained on non-ToF to ToF) that takes Bayesian penalized likelihood reconstruction (Q.Clear) images as input. The optimum parameters for image reconstruction, determined using the genetic algorithm were a Q.Clear parameter,β, of 350 and a 'medium' PDL setting. Using standard iterative reconstructions, the Omni initially showed increased background variability compared to the Discovery MI. With optimized PDL reconstruction parameters selected using the genetic algorithm the performance of the Omni surpassed that of the Discovery MI on all NEMA tests. The genetic algorithm's demonstrated ability to enhance image quality in PET-CT imaging underscores the importance of algorithm driven optimization and underscores the requirement to validate its use in the clinical setting.

TITLE: Guided block matching and 4-D transform domain filter projection denoising method for dynamic PET image reconstruction

AUTHORS: Lin Xin, Weihai Zhuo, Haikuan Liu, Tianwu Xie

JOURNAL: EJNMMI physics

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Dynamic PET is an essential tool in oncology due to its ability to visualize and quantify radiotracer uptake, which has the potential to improve imaging quality. However, image noise caused by a low photon count in dynamic PET is more significant than in static PET. This study aims to develop a novel denoising method, namely the Guided Block Matching and 4-D Transform Domain Filter (GBM4D) projection, to enhance dynamic PET image reconstruction.

Methods: The sinogram was first transformed using the Anscombe method, then denoised using a combination of hard thresholding and Wiener filtering. Each denoising step involved guided block matching and grouping, collaborative filtering, and weighted averaging. The guided block matching was performed on accumulated PET sinograms to prevent mismatching due to low photon counts. The performance of the proposed denoising method (GBM4D) was compared to other methods such as wavelet, total variation, non-local means, and BM3D using computer simulations on the Shepp-Logan and digital brain phantoms. The denoising methods were also applied to real patient data for evaluation.

Results: In all phantom studies, GBM4D outperformed other denoising methods in all time frames based on the structural similarity and peak signal-to-noise ratio. Moreover, GBM4D yielded the lowest root mean square error in the time-activity curve of all tissues and produced the highest image quality when applied to real patient data.

Conclusion: GBM4D demonstrates excellent denoising and edge-preserving capabilities, as validated through qualitative and quantitative assessments of both temporal and spatial denoising performance.

AUTHORS: Christian M Pommranz, Ezzat A Elmoujarkach, Wenhong Lan, Jorge Cabello, Pia M Linder, Hong Phuc Vo, Julia G Mannheim, Andrea Santangelo, Maurizio Conti, Christian la Fougère, Magdalena Rafecas, Fabian P Schmidt

JOURNAL: EJNMMI physics

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Background: The high sensitivity and axial coverage of large axial field of view (LAFOV) PET scanners have an unmet potential for total-body PET research. Despite these technological advances, inherent challenges to PET scans such as patient motion persist. To provide simulation-derived ground truth information, we developed a digital replica of the Biograph Vision Quadra LAFOV PET/CT scanner closely mimicking real event processing and image reconstruction.

Material and methods: The framework uses a GATE model in combination with vendor-specific software prototypes for event processing and image reconstruction (e7 tools, Siemens Healthineers). The framework was validated against experimental measurements following the NEMA NU-2 2018 standard. In addition, patient-like simulations were performed with the XCAT phantom, including respiratory motion and modeled lesions of 5, 10, 20 mm size, to assess the impact of motion artefacts on PET images using a motion-free reference.

Results: The simulation framework demonstrated high accuracy in replicating scanner performance in terms of image quality, contrast recovery (37 mm sphere: 86.5% and 85.5%; 28 mm: 82.6% and 82.4%; 22 mm: 78.8% and 77.7%; 17 mm: 74.9% and 74.6%; 13 mm: 67.0% and 67.9%; 10 mm: 55.5% and 64.3%), image noise (CV of 7.5% and 7.7%) and sensitivity (174.6 cps/kBq and 175.3 cps/kBq) for the simulation and experimental data, respectively. High agreement was found for the spatial resolution with a difference of 0.4 ± 0.3 mm and the NECR aligned well with a maximum deviation of 9%, particularly in the clinical activity range below 10 kBq/mL. Motion induced artefacts resulted in a quantification error at lesion level between - 12.3% and - 45.1%.

Conclusion: The experimentally validated digital twin of the Biograph Vision Quadra facilitates detailed studies of realistic patient scenarios while offering unprecedented opportunities for motion correction, dosimetry, AI training, and imaging protocol optimization.

TITLE: Micro-Networks for Robust MR-Guided Low Count PET Imaging

AUTHORS: Casper O da Costa-Luis, Andrew J Reader

JOURNAL: IEEE transactions on radiation and plasma medical sciences

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Noise suppression is particularly important in low count positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. Post-smoothing (PS) and regularization methods which aim to reduce noise also tend to reduce resolution and introduce bias. Alternatively, anatomical information from another modality such as magnetic resonance (MR) imaging can be used to improve image quality. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are particularly well suited to such joint image processing, but usually require large amounts of training data and have mostly been applied outside the field of medical imaging or focus on classification and segmentation, leaving PET image quality improvement relatively understudied. This article proposes the use of a relatively low-complexity CNN (micro-net) as a post-reconstruction MR-guided image processing step to reduce noise and reconstruction artefacts while also improving resolution in low count PET scans. The CNN is designed to be fully 3-D, robust to very limited amounts of training data, and to accept multiple inputs (including competitive denoising methods). Application of the proposed CNN on simulated low (30 M) count data (trained to produce standard (300 M) count reconstructions) results in a 36% lower normalized root mean squared error (NRMSE, calculated over ten realizations against the ground truth) compared to maximum-likelihood expectation maximization (MLEM) used in clinical practice. In contrast, a decrease of only 25% in NRMSE is obtained when an optimized (using knowledge of the ground truth) PS is performed. A 26% NRMSE decrease is obtained with both RM and optimized PS. Similar improvement is also observed for low count real patient datasets. Overfitting to training data is demonstrated to occur as the network size is increased. In an extreme case, a U-net (which produces better predictions for training data) is shown to completely fail on test data due to overfitting to this case of very limited training data. Meanwhile, the resultant images from the proposed CNN (which has low training data requirements) have lower noise, reduced ringing, and partial volume effects, as well as sharper edges and improved resolution compared to conventional MLEM.

TITLE: Pre-training via Transfer Learning and Pretext Learning a Convolutional Neural Network for Automated Assessments of Clinical PET Image Quality

AUTHORS: Jessica B Hopson, Radhouene Neji, Joel T Dunn, Colm J McGinnity, Anthime Flaus, Andrew J Reader, Alexander Hammers

JOURNAL: IEEE transactions on radiation and plasma medical sciences

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Positron emission tomography (PET) using a fraction of the usual injected dose would reduce the amount of radioligand needed, as well as the radiation dose to patients and staff, but would compromise reconstructed image quality. For performing the same clinical tasks with such images, a clinical (rather than numerical) image quality assessment is essential. This process can be automated with convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, the scarcity of clinical quality readings is a challenge. We hypothesise that exploiting easily available quantitative information in pretext learning tasks or using established pre-trained networks could improve CNN performance for predicting clinical assessments with limited data. CNNs were pre-trained to predict injected dose from image patches extracted from eight real patient datasets, reconstructed using between 0.5%-100% of the available data. Transfer learning with seven different patients was used to predict three clinically-scored quality metrics ranging from 0-3: global quality rating, pattern recognition and diagnostic confidence. This was compared to pre-training via a VGG16 network at varying pre-training levels. Pre-training improved test performance for this task: the mean absolute error of 0.53 (compared to 0.87 without pre-training), was within clinical scoring uncertainty. Future work may include using the CNN for novel reconstruction methods performance assessment.

TITLE: Can Q.Clear reconstruction be used to improve [68 Ga]Ga-DOTANOC PET/CT image quality in overweight NEN patients?

AUTHORS: Lucia Zanoni, Giulia Argalia, Emilia Fortunati, Claudio Malizia, Vincenzo Allegri, Diletta Calabrò, Simona Civollani, Davide Campana, Stefano Fanti, Valentina Ambrosini

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Aim/introduction: Digital PET/CT allows Q.Clear image reconstruction with different Beta (β) levels. However, no definitive standard β level for [68 Ga]Ga-DOTANOC PET/CT has been established yet. As patient's body mass index (BMI) can affect image quality, the aim of the study was to visually and semi-quantitatively assess different β levels compared to standard OSEM in overweight patients.

Materials and methods: Inclusion criteria: (1) patients with NEN included in a prospective CE-approved electronic archive; (2) [68 Ga]Ga-DOTANOC PET/CT performed on a digital tomograph between September2019/March2021; (3) BMI ≥ 25. Images were acquired following EANM guidelines and reconstructed with OSEM and Q.Clear with three β levels (800, 1000, 1600). Scans were independently reviewed by three expert readers, unaware of clinical data, who independently chose the preferred β level reconstruction for visual overall image quality. Semi-quantitative analysis was performed on each scan: SUVmax of the highest uptake lesion (SUVmax-T), liver background SUVmean (SUVmean-L), SUVmax-T/SUVmean-L, Signal-to-noise ratio for both liver (LSNR) and the highest uptake lesion (SNR-T), Contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR).

Results: Overall, 75 patients (median age: 63 years old [23-87]) were included: pre-obesity sub-group (25 ≤ BMI < 30, n = 50) and obesity sub-group (BMI ≥ 30, n = 25). PET/CT was positive for disease in 45/75 (60.0%) cases (14 obese and 31 pre-obese patients). Agreement among readers' visual rating was high (Fleiss κ = 0.88) and the β1600 was preferred in most cases (in 96% of obese patients and in 53.3% of pre-obese cases). OSEM was considered visually equal to β1600 in 44.7% of pre-obese cases and in 4% of obese patients. In a minority of pre-obese cases, OSEM was preferred (2%). In the whole population, CNR, SNR-T and LSNR were significantly different (p < 0.001) between OSEM and β1600, conversely to SUVmean-L (not significant). These results were also confirmed when calculated separately for the pre-obesity and obesity sub-groups β800 and β1000 were always rated inferior.

Conclusions: Q.Clear is a new technology for PET/CT image reconstruction that can be used to increase CNR and SNR-T, to subsequently optimise overall image quality as compared to standard OSEM. Our preliminary data on [68 Ga]Ga-DOTANOC PET/CT demonstrate that in overweight NEN patients, β1600 is preferable over β800 and β1000. Further studies are warranted to validate these results in lesions of different anatomical region and size; moreover, currently employed interpretative PET positivity criteria should be adjusted to the new reconstruction method.

Purpose: Nuclear medicine imaging modalities like computed tomography (CT), single photon emission CT (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET) are employed in the field of theranostics to estimate and plan the dose delivered to tumors and the surrounding tissues and to monitor the effect of the therapy. However, therapeutic radionuclides often provide poor images, which translate to inaccurate treatment planning and inadequate monitoring images. Multimodality information can be exploited in the reconstruction to enhance image quality. Triple modality PET/SPECT/CT scanners are particularly useful in this context due to the easier registration process between images. In this study, we propose to include PET, SPECT and CT information in the reconstruction of PET data. The method is applied to Yttrium-90 (Y) data.

Methods: Data from a NEMA phantom filled withY were used for validation. PET, SPECT and CT data from 10 patients treated with Selective Internal Radiation Therapy (SIRT) were used. Different combinations of prior images using the Hybrid kernelized expectation maximization were investigated in terms of VOI activity and noise suppression.

Results: Our results show that triple modality PET reconstruction provides significantly higher uptake when compared to the method used as standard in the hospital and OSEM. In particular, using CT-guided SPECT images, as guiding information in the PET reconstruction significantly increases uptake quantification on tumoral lesions.

Conclusion: This work proposes the first triple modality reconstruction method and demonstrates up to 69% lesion uptake increase over standard methods with SIRTY patient data. Promising results are expected for other radionuclide combination used in theranostic applications using PET and SPECT.

TITLE: PET Parametric Imaging: Past, Present, and Future

AUTHORS: Guobao Wang, Arman Rahmim, Roger N Gunn

JOURNAL: IEEE transactions on radiation and plasma medical sciences

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Positron emission tomography (PET) is actively used in a diverse range of applications in oncology, cardiology, and neurology. The use of PET in the clinical setting focuses on static (single time frame) imaging at a specific time-point post radiotracer injection and is typically considered as semi-quantitative; e.g. standardized uptake value (SUV) measures. In contrast, dynamic PET imaging requires increased acquisition times but has the advantage that it measures the full spatiotemporal distribution of a radiotracer and, in combination with tracer kinetic modeling, enables the generation of multiparametric images that more directly quantify underlying biological parameters of interest, such as blood flow, glucose metabolism, and receptor binding. Parametric images have the potential for improved detection and for more accurate and earlier therapeutic response assessment. Parametric imaging with dynamic PET has witnessed extensive research in the past four decades. In this paper, we provide an overview of past and present activities and discuss emerging opportunities in the field of parametric imaging for the future.

TITLE: Phantom and clinical evaluation of the effect of a new Bayesian penalized likelihood reconstruction algorithm (HYPER Iterative) on 68Ga-DOTA-NOC PET/CT image quality

AUTHORS: Lei Xu, Can Cui, Rushuai Li, Rui Yang, Rencong Liu, Qingle Meng, Feng Wang

JOURNAL: EJNMMI research

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Background: Bayesian penalized likelihood (BPL) algorithm is an effective way to suppress noise in the process of positron emission tomography (PET) image reconstruction by incorporating a smooth penalty. The strength of the smooth penalty is controlled by the penalization factor. The aim was to investigate the impact of different penalization factors and acquisition times in a new BPL algorithm, HYPER Iterative, on the quality of68Ga-DOTA-NOC PET/CT images. A phantom and 25 patients with neuroendocrine neoplasms who underwent68Ga-DOTA-NOC PET/CT were included. The PET data were acquired in a list-mode with a digital PET/CT scanner and reconstructed by ordered subset expectation maximization (OSEM) and the HYPER Iterative algorithm with seven penalization factors between 0.03 and 0.5 for acquisitions of 2 and 3 min per bed position (m/b), both including time-of-flight and point of spread function recovery. The contrast recovery (CR), background variability (BV) and radioactivity concentration ratio (RCR) of the phantom; The SUVmeanand coefficient of variation (CV) of the liver; and the SUVmaxof the lesions were measured. Image quality was rated by two radiologists using a five-point Likert scale.

Results: The CR, BV, and RCR decreased with increasing penalization factors for four "hot" spheres, and the HYPER Iterative 2 m/b groups with penalization factors of 0.07 to 0.2 had equivalent CR and superior BV performance compared to the OSEM 3 m/b group. The liver SUVmeanvalues were approximately equal in all reconstruction groups (range 5.95-5.97), and the liver CVs of the HYPER Iterative 2 m/b and 3 m/b groups with the penalization factors of 0.1 to 0.2 were equivalent to those of the OSEM 3 m/b group (p = 0.113-0.711 and p = 0.079-0.287, respectively), while the lesion SUVmaxsignificantly increased by 19-22% and 25%, respectively (all p < 0.001). The highest qualitative score was attained at a penalization factor of 0.2 for the HYPER Iterative 2 m/b group (3.20 ± 0.52) and 3 m/b group (3.70 ± 0.36); those scores were comparable to or greater than that of the OSEM 3 m/b group (3.09 ± 0.36, p = 0.388 and p < 0.001, respectively).

Conclusions: The HYPER Iterative algorithm with a penalization factor of 0.2 resulted in higher lesion contrast and lower image noise than OSEM for68Ga-DOTA-NOC PET/CT, allowing the same image quality to be achieved with less injected radioactivity and a shorter acquisition time.

ABSTRACT:
Purpose of review: This review presents the current state of imaging approaches that enable real-time molecular imaging in the interventional suite and discusses the potential future use of integrated nuclear imaging and fluoroscopy for intraprocedural guidance in the evaluation and treatment of both cardiovascular and oncological diseases.

Recent findings: Although there are no commercially available real-time hybrid nuclear imaging devices that are approved for use in the interventional suite, prototype open gantry hybrid nuclear imaging and x-ray c-arm imaging systems and theranostic catheter for location radiotracer detection are currently undergoing development and testing by multiple groups. The integration of physiological and molecular targeted nuclear imaging for real-time delivery of targeted theranostics in the interventional laboratory may enable more personalized care for a wide variety of cardiovascular procedures and improve patient outcomes.

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear cardiology : official publication of the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Background: New Block-Sequential-Regularized-Expectation-Maximization (BSREM) image reconstruction technique has been introduced for clinical use mainly for oncologic use. Accurate and quantitative image reconstruction is essential in myocardial perfusion imaging with positron emission tomography (PET) as it utilizes absolute quantitation of myocardial blood flow (MBF). The aim of the study was to evaluate BSREM reconstruction for quantitation in patients with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD).

Methods and results: We analyzed cardiac [15O]H2O PET studies of 177 patients evaluated for CAD. Differences between BSREM and Ordered-Subset-Expectation-Maximization with Time-Of-Flight (TOF) and Point-Spread-Function (PSF) modeling (OSEM-TOF-PSF) in terms of MBF, perfusable tissue fraction, and vascular volume fraction were measured. Classification of ischemia was assessed between the algorithms. OSEM-TOF-PSF and BSREM provided similar global stress MBF in patients with ischemia (1.84 ± 0.21 g⋅ml-1⋅min-1vs 1.86 ± 0.21 g⋅ml-1⋅min-1) and no ischemia (3.26 ± 0.34 g⋅ml-1⋅min-1vs 3.28 ± 0.34 g⋅ml-1⋅min-1). Global resting MBF was also similar (0.97 ± 0.12 g⋅ml-1⋅min-1and 1.12 ± 0.06 g⋅ml-1⋅min-1). The largest mean relative difference in MBF values was 7%. Presence of myocardial ischemia was classified concordantly in 99% of patients using OSEM-TOF-PSF and BSREM reconstructions CONCLUSION: OSEM-TOF-PSF and BSREM image reconstructions produce similar MBF values and diagnosis of myocardial ischemia in patients undergoing [15O]H2O PET due to suspected obstructive coronary artery disease.

ABSTRACT:
Positron emission tomography (PET) in nuclear medicine is especially used for diagnosis in clinical oncology, and PET/CT examination using18F-FDG is very useful for staging and therapy evaluation of cancer. The excellent property of PET diagnosis is that the functional information of cells can be evaluated quantitatively, but it also has the problem that its quantitative value fluctuates depending on image reconstruction conditions and body movements/respiratory movements. In this paper, we summarize the PET research that has been conducted so far in clinical oncology, and also introduce our researches for improve the quantitativeness.

TITLE: TOF-PET Image Reconstruction With Multiple Timing Kernels Applied on Cherenkov Radiation in BGO

AUTHORS: Nikos Efthimiou, Nicolaus Kratochwil, Stefan Gundacker, Andrea Polesel, Matteo Salomoni, Etiennette Auffray, Marco Pizzichemi

JOURNAL: IEEE transactions on radiation and plasma medical sciences

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Today Time-of-Flight (TOF), in PET scanners, assumes a single, well-defined timing resolution for all events. However, recent BGO-Cherenkov detectors, combining prompt Cherenkov emission and the typical BGO scintillation, can sort events into multiple timing kernels, best described by the Gaussian mixture models. The number of Cherenkov photons detected per event impacts directly the detector time resolution and signal rise time, which can later be used to improve the coincidence timing resolution. This work presents a simulation toolkit which applies multiple timing spreads on the coincident events and an image reconstruction that incorporates this information. A full cylindrical BGO-Cherenkov PET model was compared, in terms of contrast recovery and contrast-to-noise ratio, against an LYSO model with a time resolution of 213 ps. Two reconstruction approaches for the mixture kernels were tested: 1) mixture Gaussian and 2) decomposed simple Gaussian kernels. The decomposed model used the exact mixture component applied during the simulation. Images reconstructed using mixture kernels provided similar mean value and less noise than the decomposed. However, typically, more iterations were needed. Similarly, the LYSO model, with a single TOF kernel, converged faster than the BGO-Cherenkov with multiple kernels. The results indicate that the model complexity slows down convergence. However, due to the higher sensitivity, the contrast-to-noise ratio was 26.4% better for the BGO model.

TITLE: 3D iterative reconstruction can do so much more than reduce dose

AUTHORS: James A Case

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear cardiology : official publication of the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Recent advances in software and hardware for cardiac SPECT have the potential to revolutionize nuclear cardiology. It is easy to use these technologies to maintain the status quo and lower radiation dose, despite the fact there is very little evidence that lowering patient dose in already low dose imaging protocols confers any benefit to patients. Cardiac SPECT has tremendous potential for risk stratification, molecular tracers, and high temporal resolution management of patients with electrophysiological disorders. In addition, these new reconstruction techniques can offer spatial resolution that is comparable and sometimes even superior to PET. Lastly, recent research has also held out the potential for performing absolute blood flow qualification using SPECT instrumentation. As these new technologies become available, the goal should be to make images better and improve patient care first, then optimize the dose.

TITLE: Robust whole-body PET image denoising using 3D diffusion models: evaluation across various scanners, tracers, and dose levels

AUTHORS: Boxiao Yu, Savas Ozdemir, Yafei Dong, Wei Shao, Tinsu Pan, Kuangyu Shi, Kuang Gong

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Whole-body PET imaging plays an essential role in cancer diagnosis and treatment but suffers from low image quality. Traditional deep learning-based denoising methods work well for a specific acquisition but are less effective in handling diverse PET protocols. In this study, we proposed and validated a 3D Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (3D DDPM) as a robust and universal solution for whole-body PET image denoising.

Methods: The proposed 3D DDPM gradually injected noise into the images during the forward diffusion phase, allowing the model to learn to reconstruct the clean data during the reverse diffusion process. A 3D convolutional network was trained using high-quality data from the Biograph Vision Quadra PET/CT scanner to generate the score function, enabling the model to capture accurate PET distribution information extracted from the total-body datasets. The trained 3D DDPM was evaluated on datasets from four scanners, four tracer types, and six dose levels representing a broad spectrum of clinical scenarios.

Results: The proposed 3D DDPM consistently outperformed 2D DDPM, 3D UNet, and 3D GAN, demonstrating its superior denoising performance across all tested conditions. Additionally, the model's uncertainty maps exhibited lower variance, reflecting its higher confidence in its outputs.

Conclusions: The proposed 3D DDPM can effectively handle various clinical settings, including variations in dose levels, scanners, and tracers, establishing it as a promising foundational model for PET image denoising. The trained 3D DDPM model of this work can be utilized off the shelf by researchers as a whole-body PET image denoising solution.

TITLE: Adversarial EM for variational deep learning: Application to semi-supervised image quality enhancement in low-dose PET and low-dose CT

AUTHORS: Vatsala Sharma, Suyash P Awate, for the

JOURNAL: Medical image analysis

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
In positron emission tomography (PET) and X-ray computed tomography (CT), reducing radiation dose can cause significant degradation in image quality. For image quality enhancement in low-dose PET and CT, we propose a novel theoretical adversarial and variational deep neural network (DNN) framework relying on expectation maximization (EM) based learning, termed adversarial EM (AdvEM). AdvEM proposes an encoder-decoder architecture with a multiscale latent space, and generalized-Gaussian models enabling datum-specific robust statistical modeling in latent space and image space. The model robustness is further enhanced by including adversarial learning in the training protocol. Unlike typical variational-DNN learning, AdvEM proposes latent-space sampling from the posterior distribution, and uses a Metropolis-Hastings scheme. Unlike existing schemes for PET or CT image enhancement which train using pairs of low-dose images with their corresponding normal-dose versions, we propose a semi-supervised AdvEM (ssAdvEM) framework that enables learning using a small number of normal-dose images. AdvEM and ssAdvEM enable per-pixel uncertainty estimates for their outputs. Empirical analyses on real-world PET and CT data involving many baselines, out-of-distribution data, and ablation studies show the benefits of the proposed framework.

TITLE: Standardisation of conventional and advanced iterative reconstruction methods for Gallium-68 multi-centre PET-CT trials

AUTHORS: Georgios Krokos, Lucy C Pike, Gary J R Cook, Paul K Marsden

JOURNAL: EJNMMI physics

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: To assess the applicability of the Fluorine-18 performance specifications defined by EANM Research Ltd (EARL), in Gallium-68 multi-centre PET-CT trials using conventional (ordered subset expectation maximisation, OSEM) and advanced iterative reconstructions which include the systems' point spread function (PSF) and a Bayesian penalised likelihood algorithm (BPL) commercially known as Q.CLEAR. The possibility of standardising the two advanced reconstruction methods was examined.

Methods: The NEMA image quality phantom was filled with Gallium-68 and scanned on a GE PET-CT system. PSF and BPL with varying post-reconstruction Gaussian filter width (2-6.4 mm) and penalisation factor (200-1200), respectively, were applied. The average peak-to-valley ratio from six profiles across each sphere was estimated to inspect any edge artefacts. Image noise was assessed using background variability and image roughness. Six GE and Siemens PET-CT scanners provided Gallium-68 images of the NEMA phantom using both conventional and advanced reconstructions from which the maximum, mean and peak recoveries were drawn. Fourteen patients underwent68Ga-PSMA PET-CT imaging. BPL (200-1200) reconstructions of the data were compared against PSF smoothed with a 6.4-mm Gaussian filter.

Results: A Gaussian filter width of approximately 6 mm for PSF and a penalisation factor of 800 for BPL were needed to suppress the edge artefacts. In addition, those reconstructions provided the closest agreement between the two advanced iterative reconstructions and low noise levels with the background variability and the image roughness being lower than 7.5% and 11.5%, respectively. The recoveries for all methods generally performed at the lower limits of the EARL specifications, especially for the 13- and 10-mm spheres for which up to 27% (conventional) and 41% (advanced reconstructions) lower limits are suggested. The lesion standardised uptake values from the clinical data were significantly different between BPL and PSF smoothed with a Gaussian filter of 6.4 mm wide for all penalisation factors except for 800 and 1000.

Conclusion: It is possible to standardise the advanced reconstruction methods with the reconstruction parameters being also sufficient for minimising the edge artefacts and noise in the images. For both conventional and advanced reconstructions, Gallium-68 specific recovery coefficient limits were required, especially for the smallest phantom spheres.

TITLE: Comparison of PMT-based TF64 and SiPM-based Vereos PET/CT systems for 90 Y imaging and dosimetry optimization: A quantitative study

AUTHORS: Nicola Trotta, Benoît Collette, Céline Mathey, Irina Vierasu, Ana-Maria Bucalau, Gontran Verset, Rodrigo Moreno-Reyes, Serge Goldman

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Background: Selective internal radiotherapy based on transarterial radioembolization (TARE) with yttrium-90 (90Y) microspheres is an established treatment for primary or metastatic liver disease.

Purpose: The objective of this work is to optimize the dosimetry of patients treated with90Y TARE, using positron emission tomography (PET) images.

Methods: The NEMA 2012 PET phantom was filled with nearly 3.9 GBq of90Y activity and acquired at days 0, 3, 5, 7, and 9 on a classic time-of-flight PET/computed tomography (CT) scanner (Philips TF64) and on a silicon photomultiplier (SiPM)-based PET/CT scanner (Philips Vereos). Acquisitions were carried on following the guidelines proposed in a previously published multicentric trial and images were reconstructed by varying and combining the available parameters. Comparisons were performed to identify the best set(s) of parameters leading to the most accurate90Y-PET image(s), in terms of activity distribution. Then, for both scanners, the best images were analyzed with Simplicit90Y, a personalized dosimetry software using multicompartmental Medical Internal Radiation Dose model. The comparison between measured and true doses allowed to identify the image granting the most consistent dose estimations and, therefore, to designate the set of parameters to be applied on patients' data for the reconstruction of optimized clinical images. Posttreatment dosimetry of four patients was then realized with Simplicit90Y using optimized imaging datasets.

Results: Based on activity distribution comparisons and dose estimations over phantom and patients data, the SiPM-based PET/CT system appeared more suitable than the photomultiplier tube-based TF64 for90Y-PET imaging. With the SiPM-based PET/CT system, reconstructed images with a 2-mm voxel size combined with the application of the point spread function correction led to the most accurate results for quantitative90Y measures.

Conclusions: For the SiPM-based PET/CT scanner, an optimized set of reconstruction parameters has been identified and applied on patients' data in order to generate the most accurate image to be used for an improved personalized90Y-PET dosimetry, ensuring a reliable evaluation of the delivered doses.

TITLE: Evaluation of [68Ga]Ga-PSMA PET/CT images acquired with a reduced scan time duration in prostate cancer patients using the digital biograph vision

AUTHORS: Manuel Weber, Walter Jentzen, Regina Hofferber, Ken Herrmann, Wolfgang Peter Fendler, Maurizio Conti, Axel Wetter, David Kersting, Christoph Rischpler, Pedro Fragoso Costa

JOURNAL: EJNMMI research

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Aim: [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT allows for a superior detection of prostate cancer tissue, especially in the context of a low tumor burden. Digital PET/CT bears the potential of reducing scan time duration/administered tracer activity due to, for instance, its higher sensitivity and improved time coincidence resolution. It might thereby expand [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT that is currently limited by68Ge/68Ga-generator yield. Our aim was to clinically evaluate the influence of a reduced scan time duration in combination with different image reconstruction algorithms on the diagnostic performance.

Methods: Twenty prostate cancer patients (11 for biochemical recurrence, 5 for initial staging, 4 for metastatic disease) sequentially underwent [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT on a digital Siemens Biograph Vision. PET data were collected in continuous-bed-motion mode with a mean scan time duration of 16.7 min (reference acquisition protocol) and 4.6 min (reduced acquisition protocol). Four iterative reconstruction algorithms were applied using a time-of-flight (TOF) approach alone or combined with point-spread-function (PSF) correction, each with 2 or 4 iterations. To evaluate the diagnostic performance, the following metrics were chosen: (a) per-region detectability, (b) the tumor maximum and peak standardized uptake values (SUVmax and SUVpeak), and (c) image noise using the liver's activity distribution.

Results: Overall, 98% of regions (91% of affected regions) were correctly classified in the reduced acquisition protocol independent of the image reconstruction algorithm. Two nodal lesions (each ≤ 4 mm) were not identified (leading to downstaging in 1/20 cases). Mean absolute percentage deviation of SUVmax (SUVpeak) was approximately 9% (6%) for each reconstruction algorithm. The mean image noise increased from 13 to 21% (4 iterations) and from 10 to 15% (2 iterations) for PSF + TOF and TOF images.

Conclusions: High agreement at 3.5-fold reduction of scan time in terms of per-region detection (98% of regions) and image quantification (mean deviation ≤ 10%) was demonstrated; however, small lesions can be missed in about 10% of patients leading to downstaging (T1N0M0 instead of T1N1M0) in 5% of patients. Our results suggest that a reduction of scan time duration or administered [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 activities can be considered in metastatic patients, where missing small lesions would not impact patient management. Limitations include the small and heterogeneous sample size and the lack of follow-up.

TITLE: Regional gray matter-dedicated SUVR with 3D-MRI detects positive amyloid deposits in equivocal amyloid PET images

AUTHORS: Kazunari Ishii, Takahiro Yamada, Kohei Hanaoka, Hayato Kaida, Koichi Miyazaki, Masami Ueda, Kazushi Hanada, Kazumasa Saigoh, Julia Sauerbeck, Axel Rominger, Peter Bartenstein, Yuichi Kimura

JOURNAL: Annals of nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: It is usually easy to judge whether amyloid PET images should be interpreted as positive or negative for amyloid deposits by visual inspection or quantitative measurement standard uptake value ratio (SUVR), but the findings are equivocal in some cases. As conventional mean cortical SUVR (mcSUVR) measures accumulation in both gray matter (GM) and white matter, it may mis-estimate amyloid deposits. The purpose of the study was to develop a regional GM-dedicated SUVR measuring (GMSUVR) system for amyloid PET images with 3D-MRI, and evaluate its utility for detecting amyloid deposits in equivocal cases.

Methods: Of 126 subjects who underwent amyloid PET with11C-PiB and 3D-MRI, the area of amyloid-positive regions and the critical regional GMSUVR thresholds were first determined in 15 amyloid-positive and 15 amyloid-negative patients, using the automatic volumetric measurement of segmented brain images system. We then tested 36 amyloid-negative, 60 amyloid-positive, and 13 equivocal subjects with this GMSUVR system and with conventional mcSUVR.

Results: Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were 100%, 92%, 97%, 95%, and 100% for the GMSUVR system; and 97%, 86%, 93%, 92% and 94%, respectively, for mcSUVR. In 24 cases in which the findings were equivocal or discordant, the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, PPV, and NPV were all 100% for the GMSUVR system; and were 90%, 33%, 83%, 90%, and 33%, respectively, for mcSUVR.

Conclusion: The regional GMSUVR measurement method was well able to discriminate between amyloid-positive and -negative subjects, even in cases where amyloid deposition was equivocal.

TITLE: Multicenter quantitative 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography performance harmonization: use of hottest voxels towards more robust quantification

AUTHORS: Habibeh Vosoughi, Mehdi Momennezhad, Farshad Emami, Mohsen Hajizadeh, Arman Rahmim, Parham Geramifar

JOURNAL: Quantitative imaging in medicine and surgery

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Background: Harmonization methods reduce variability between different make and models of positron emission tomography (PET) scanners. The study aims to explore harmonization strategies that lead to comparable and robust quantitative metrics in a multicenter setting.

Methods: NEMA IEC Phantom data acquisition was performed for low and high spheres-to-background ratios (SBR4:1 and 10:1) on six PET/CT (computed tomography) scanners. Different reconstruction sets, including the number of sub-iterations, number of subsets, and full width at half maximum (FWHM) for each scanner, were evaluated towards optimized and harmonized reconstruction settings. Recovery coefficients (RCs) of four quantitative metrics, including standardized uptake value (SUV)max, SUVISO-50(SUVmeanin 50% isocontour), SUVpeak, and mean uptake of 10 highest concentration voxels were evaluated as RCmax, RCISO-50, RCpeak, and RC10V, representing percent difference relative to the static ground truth case as functions of sphere sizes. A set of image reconstruction parameters was proposed for harmonized reconstruction to minimize variability between scanners. The root mean square error (RMSE), curvature, and reproducibility were examined. The proposed reconstruction protocols for harmonization and standard clinical reconstruction settings were compared to each other across all scanners.

Results: A significant difference (P value <0.0001) was observed in the aforementioned quantitative metrics between SBR10 and SBR4. Reconstruction parameter sets with the smallest RMSE and RC values within 10% bias were identified as the best candidate for harmonization. The coefficient of variation of the mean value of RCs (CVMRC) shows a remarkable reduction of about 28%, 26%, 32%, and 19% in harmonized reconstruction settings for MRCmax, MRCISO-50, MRCpeak, and MRC10V, respectively. CVMRCfor MRC10Vin the harmonized reconstruction setting was 5.9% in SBR4, while the smallest value in SBR10 belongs to MRCpeak,with a value of 5.8%. The reproducibility of RC is improved by deriving the value from ten hottest voxels and is equally reproducible with RCpeak. Compared to RCmaxand RCISO-50, the variability is reduced by 18% and 22% if ten voxels are pooled.

Conclusions: Harmonizing PET/CT systems with and without point spread function/time of flight (PSF/TOF) using various vendor-developed image reconstruction algorithms improves the quantification reproducibility. RC10V, likewise RCpeak, is superior to the rest of the quantitative indices in terms of accuracy and reproducibility and helpful in quantifying lesion volume below 1 mL.

TITLE: Can a penalized-likelihood estimation algorithm be used to reduce the injected dose or the acquisition time in 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT studies?

AUTHORS: Alexandre Chicheportiche, Elinor Goshen, Jeremy Godefroy, Simona Grozinsky-Glasberg, Kira Oleinikov, Amichay Meirovitz, David J Gross, Simona Ben-Haim

ABSTRACT:
Background: Image quality and quantitative accuracy of positron emission tomography (PET) depend on several factors such as uptake time, scanner characteristics and image reconstruction methods. Ordered subset expectation maximization (OSEM) is considered the gold standard for image reconstruction. Penalized-likelihood estimation (PL) algorithms have been recently developed for PET reconstruction to improve quantitation accuracy while maintaining or even improving image quality. In PL algorithms, a regularization parameter β controls the penalization of relative differences between neighboring pixels and determines image characteristics. In the present study, we aim to compare the performance of Q.Clear (PL algorithm, GE Healthcare) and OSEM (3 iterations, 8 subsets, 6-mm post-processing filter) for68Ga-DOTATATE (68Ga-DOTA) PET studies, both visually and quantitatively. Thirty consecutive whole-body68Ga-DOTA studies were included. The data were acquired in list mode and were reconstructed using 3D OSEM and Q.Clear with various values of β and various acquisition times per bed position (bp), thus generating images with reduced injected dose (1.5 min/bp: β = 300-1100; 1.0 min/bp: β = 600-1400 and 0.5 min/bp: β = 800-2200). An additional analysis adding β values up to 1500, 1700 and 3000 for 1.5, 1.0 and 0.5 min/bp, respectively, was performed for a random sample of 8 studies. Evaluation was performed using a phantom and clinical data. Two experienced nuclear medicine physicians blinded to the variables assessed the image quality visually.

Results: Clinical images reconstructed with Q.Clear, set at 1.5, 1.0 and 0.5 min/bp using β = 1100, 1300 and 3000, respectively, resulted in images with noise equivalence to 3D OSEM (1.5 min/bp) with a mean increase in SUVmaxof 14%, 13% and 4%, an increase in SNR of 30%, 24% and 10%, and an increase in SBR of 13%, 13% and 2%. Visual assessment yielded similar results for β values of 1100-1400 and 1300-1600 for 1.5 and 1.0 min/bp, respectively, although for 0.5 min/bp there was no significant improvement compared to OSEM.

Conclusion: 68Ga-DOTA reconstructions with Q.Clear, 1.5 and 1.0 min/bp, resulted in increased tumor SUVmaxand in improved SNR and SBR at a similar level of noise compared to 3D OSEM. Q.Clear with β = 1300-1600 enables one-third reduction of acquisition time or injected dose, with similar image quality compared to 3D OSEM.

TITLE: Simultaneous activity and attenuation estimation in TOF-PET with TV-constrained nonconvex optimization

AUTHORS: Zhimei Ren, Emil Y Sidky, Rina Foygel Barber, Chien-Min Kao, Xiaochuan Pan

JOURNAL: ArXiv

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
An alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) framework is developed for nonsmooth biconvex optimization for inverse problems in imaging. In particular, the simultaneous estimation of activity and attenuation (SAA) problem in time-of-flight positron emission tomography (TOF-PET) has such a structure when maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is employed. The ADMM framework is applied to MLE for SAA in TOF-PET, resulting in the ADMM-SAA algorithm. This algorithm is extended by imposing total variation (TV) constraints on both the activity and attenuation map, resulting in the ADMM-TVSAA algorithm. The performance of this algorithm is illustrated using the penalized maximum likelihood activity and attenuation estimation (P-MLAA) algorithm as a reference. Additional results on step-size tuning and on the use of unconstrained ADMM-SAA are presented in the previous arXiv submission: arXiv:2303.17042v1.

JOURNAL: Journal of magnetic resonance imaging : JMRI

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Background: Whole-body positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (WB-PET/MRI) is increasingly used in oncology. However, chest staging remains challenging.

Purpose: To compare the diagnostic performance of a free-breathing 3D-T1-GRE stack-of-stars volume interpolated breath-hold examination (StarVIBE) with that of a 3D-T1-GRE volume interpolated breath-hold examination (VIBE) during WB-PET/MRI for chest staging.

Study type: Retrospective, cohort study.

Population: One hundred and twenty-three patients were referred for initial staging of solid cancer, 46 of whom had pulmonary nodules and 14 had pulmonary metastasis.

Field strength/sequence: Free-breathing 3D-T1-GRE stack-of-stars (StarVIBE) and Cartesian 3D-T1-GRE VIBE at 3.0 T.

Assessment: Image quality was assessed using a 4-point scale and using the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of lung parenchyma and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of pulmonary nodules. Diagnostic performances of both sequences were determined by three independent radiologists for detection of pulmonary nodules, lymph node involvement, and bone metastases using chest CT, pathology, and follow-up as reference standards.

Statistical tests: Paired Student's t-test; chi-squared; Fisher's exact test. A P value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results: StarVIBE quality was judged as better in 34% of cases and at least equivalent to VIBE in 89% of cases, with significantly higher quality scores (4 [4-4] vs. 3 [3-4], respectively). SNR and CNR values were significantly higher with StarVIBE (8 ± 1.3 and 9.7 ± 4.6, respectively) than with VIBE (1.8 ± 0.2 and 5.5 ± 3.3, respectively). Compared to VIBE, StarVIBE showed significantly higher sensitivity (73% [95% CI 62-82] vs. 44% [95% CI 33-55], respectively) and specificity (95% [95% CI 88-99] vs. 67% [95% CI 56-77]) for pulmonary nodules detection and significantly higher sensitivity (100% [95% CI 89-100] vs. 67% [95% CI 48-82], respectively) for detection of lymph node involvement. Sensitivities for bone metastases detection were not significantly different (100% [95% CI 88-100] vs. 82% [95% CI 63-94], P = 0.054).

Data conclusion: Owing to improved SNR and CNR and spatial resolution, a free-breathing 3D stack-of-stars T1-GRE sequence improves chest staging in comparison with standard 3D-T1-GRE VIBE and may be integrated in WB-PET/MRI acquisitions for initial staging of solid cancer.

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Modern facial surgical planning and therapeutic strategies rely heavily on the precise segmentation of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses from computed tomography (CT) images for quantitative analysis. Nevertheless, manual segmentation is labor-intensive and prone to inconsistencies, highlighting the need for automatic segmentation methods. A significant challenge in this field is the lack of publicly available clinical datasets for research. To address this issue, we introduce NagalSeg, the first large-scale, publicly available dataset for nasal cavity and paranasal sinus segmentation. In comparison to existing nasal structure segmentation datasets, which are either private or small-scale, NagalSeg stands out as the first publicly accessible dataset. It provides an order of magnitude more labeled data, consisting of 130 3D CT scans with pixel-wise annotations of five anatomical structures: the left nasal cavity, right nasal cavity, nasopharynx, left maxillary sinus, and right maxillary sinus. The NagalSeg dataset serves as an open-access resource to facilitate the development and evaluation of segmentation algorithms and promote future in-depth research towards the clinical application of artificial intelligence methods.

TITLE: 18F-FDG dose reduction using deep learning-based PET reconstruction

AUTHORS: Ryuji Akita, Komei Takauchi, Mana Ishibashi, Shota Kondo, Shogo Ono, Kazushi Yokomachi, Yusuke Ochi, Masao Kiguchi, Hidenori Mitani, Yuko Nakamura, Kazuo Awai

JOURNAL: EJNMMI research

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Background: A deep learning-based image reconstruction (DLR) algorithm that can reduce the statistical noise has been developed for PET/CT imaging. It may reduce the administered dose of18F-FDG and minimize radiation exposure while maintaining diagnostic quality. This retrospective study evaluated whether the injected18F-FDG dose could be reduced by applying DLR to PET images. To this aim, we compared the quantitative image quality metrics and the false-positive rate between DLR with a reduced18F-FDG dose and Ordered Subsets Expectation Maximization (OSEM) with a standard dose.

Results: This study included 90 oncology patients who underwent18F-FDG PET/CT. They were divided into 3 groups (30 patients each): group A (18F-FDG dose per body weight [BW]: 2.00-2.99 MBq/kg; PET image reconstruction: DLR), group B (3.00-3.99 MBq/kg; DLR), and group C (standard dose group; 4.00-4.99 MBq/kg; OSEM). The evaluation was performed using the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), target-to-background ratio (TBR), and false-positive rate. DLR yielded significantly higher SNRs in groups A and B than group C (p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in the TBR between groups A and C, and between groups B and C (p = 0.983 and 0.605, respectively). In group B, more than 80% of patients weighing less than 75 kg had at most one false positive result. In contrast, in group B patients weighing 75 kg or more, as well as in group A, less than 80% of patients had at most one false-positives.

Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the injected18F-FDG dose can be reduced to 3.0 MBq/kg in patients weighing less than 75 kg by applying DLR. Compared to the recommended dose in the European Association of Nuclear Medicine (EANM) guidelines for 90 s per bed position (4.7 MBq/kg), this represents a dose reduction of 36%. Further optimization of DLR algorithms is required to maintain comparable diagnostic accuracy in patients weighing 75 kg or more.

TITLE: Multi-task multi-scale learning for outcome prediction in 3D PET images

JOURNAL: Computers in biology and medicine

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Background and objectives: Predicting patient response to treatment and survival in oncology is a prominent way towards precision medicine. To this end, radiomics has been proposed as a field of study where images are used instead of invasive methods. The first step in radiomic analysis in oncology is lesion segmentation. However, this task is time consuming and can be physician subjective. Automated tools based on supervised deep learning have made great progress in helping physicians. However, they are data hungry, and annotated data remains a major issue in the medical field where only a small subset of annotated images are available.

Methods: In this work, we propose a multi-task, multi-scale learning framework to predict patient's survival and response. We show that the encoder can leverage multiple tasks to extract meaningful and powerful features that improve radiomic performance. We also show that subsidiary tasks serve as an inductive bias so that the model can better generalize.

Results: Our model was tested and validated for treatment response and survival in esophageal and lung cancers, with an area under the ROC curve of 77% and 71% respectively, outperforming single-task learning methods.

Conclusions: Multi-task multi-scale learning enables higher performance of radiomic analysis by extracting rich information from intratumoral and peritumoral regions.

TITLE: Deep Convolutional Backbone Comparison for Automated PET Image Quality Assessment

AUTHORS: Jessica B Hopson, Anthime Flaus, Colm J McGinnity, Radhouene Neji, Andrew J Reader, Alexander Hammers

JOURNAL: IEEE transactions on radiation and plasma medical sciences

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Pretraining deep convolutional network mappings using natural images helps with medical imaging analysis tasks; this is important given the limited number of clinically-annotated medical images. Many two-dimensional pretrained backbone networks, however, are currently available. This work compared 18 different backbones from 5 architecture groups (pretrained on ImageNet) for the task of assessing [18F]FDG brain Positron Emission Transmission (PET) image quality (reconstructed at seven simulated doses), based on three clinical image quality metrics (global quality rating, pattern recognition, and diagnostic confidence). Using two-dimensional randomly sampled patches, up to eight patients (at three dose levels each) were used for training, with three separate patient datasets used for testing. Each backbone was trained five times with the same training and validation sets, and with six cross-folds. Training only the final fully connected layer (with ~6,000-20,000 trainable parameters) achieved a test mean-absolute-error of ~0.5 (which was within the intrinsic uncertainty of clinical scoring). To compare "classical" and over-parameterized regimes, the pretrained weights of the last 40% of the network layers were then unfrozen. The mean-absolute-error fell below 0.5 for 14 out of the 18 backbones assessed, including two that previously failed to train. Generally, backbones with residual units (e.g. DenseNets and ResNetV2s), were suited to this task, in terms of achieving the lowest mean-absolute-error at test time (~0.45 - 0.5). This proof-of-concept study shows that over-parameterization may also be important for automated PET image quality assessments.

TITLE: A thick semi-monolithic scintillator detector for clinical PET scanners

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Both monolithic and semi-monolithic scintillator positron emission tomography (PET) detectors can measure the depth of interaction with single-ended readout. Usually scintillators with a thickness of 10 mm or less are used since the position resolutions of the detectors degrade as the scintillator thickness increases. In this work, the performance of a 20 mm thick long rectangular semi-monolithic scintillator PET detector was measured by using both single-ended and dual-ended readouts with silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) arrays to provide a high detection efficiency. The semi-monolithic scintillator detector consists of nine lutetium-yttrium oxyorthosilicate slices measuring 1.37 × 51.2 × 20 mm3with erythrocyte sedimentation rate foils of 0.065 mm thickness in between the slices. The SiPM array at each end of the scintillator detector consists of 16 × 4 SiPMs with a pixel size of 3.0 × 3.0 mm2and a pitch of 3.2 mm. The 64 signals of each SiPM array are processed by using the TOFPET2 application-specific integrated circuit individually. All but the edge slices can be clearly resolved for the detectors with both single-ended and dual-ended readouts. The single-ended readout detector provides an average full width at half maximum (FWHM) Y (continuous direction) position resolution of 2.43 mm, Z (depth direction) position resolution of 4.77 mm, energy resolution of 25.7% and timing resolution of 779 ps. The dual-ended readout detector significantly improves the Y and Z position resolutions, slightly improves the energy and timing resolution at the cost of two photodetectors required for one detector module and provides an average FWHM Y position resolution of 1.97 mm, Z position resolution of 2.60 mm, energy resolution of 21.7% and timing resolution of 718 ps. The energy and timing resolution of the semi-monolithic scintillator detector in this work are worse than those of the segmented scintillator array detector and need to be further improved. The semi-monolithic scintillator detector described in this work reduces costs as compared to the traditional segmented scintillator array detector and reduces the edge effect as compared to the monolithic scintillator detector.

ABSTRACT:
Objective. In this study we introduce spatiotemporal emission reconstruction prompt gamma timing (SER-PGT), a new method to directly reconstruct the prompt photon emission in the space and time domains inside the patient in proton therapy.Approach. SER-PGT is based on the numerical optimisation of a multidimensional likelihood function, followed by a post-processing of the results. The current approach relies on a specific implementation of the maximum-likelihood expectation maximisation algorithm. The robustness of the method is guaranteed by the complete absence of any information about the target composition in the algorithm.Main results. Accurate Monte Carlo simulations indicate a range resolution of about 0.5 cm (standard deviation) when considering 107primary protons impinging on an homogeneous phantom. Preliminary results on an anthropomorphic phantom are also reported.Significance. By showing the feasibility for the reconstruction of the primary particle range using PET detectors, this study provides significant basis for the development of an hybrid in-beam PET and prompt photon device.

TITLE: PET imaging of neurotransmission using direct parametric reconstruction

AUTHORS: Yoann Petibon, Nathaniel M Alpert, Jinsong Ouyang, Diego A Pizzagalli, Cristina Cusin, Maurizio Fava, Georges El Fakhri, Marc D Normandin

JOURNAL: NeuroImage

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Receptor ligand-based dynamic Positron Emission Tomography (PET) permits the measurement of neurotransmitter release in the human brain. For single-scan paradigms, the conventional method of estimating changes in neurotransmitter levels relies on fitting a pharmacokinetic model to activity concentration histories extracted after PET image reconstruction. However, due to the statistical fluctuations of activity concentration data at the voxel scale, parametric images computed using this approach often exhibit low signal-to-noise ratio, impeding characterization of neurotransmitter release. Numerous studies have shown that direct parametric reconstruction (DPR) approaches, which combine image reconstruction and kinetic analysis in a unified framework, can improve the signal-to-noise ratio of parametric mapping. However, there is little experience with DPR in imaging of neurotransmission and the performance of the approach in this application has not been evaluated before in humans. In this report, we present and evaluate a DPR methodology that computes 3-D distributions of ligand transport, binding potential (BPND) and neurotransmitter release magnitude (γ) from a dynamic sequence of PET sinograms. The technique employs the linear simplified reference region model (LSRRM) of Alpert et al. (2003), which represents an extension of the simplified reference region model that incorporates time-varying binding parameters due to radioligand displacement by release of neurotransmitter. Estimation of parametric images is performed by gradient-based optimization of a Poisson log-likelihood function incorporating LSRRM kinetics and accounting for the effects of head movement, attenuation, detector sensitivity, random and scattered coincidences. A11C-raclopride simulation study showed that the proposed approach substantially reduces the bias and variance of voxel-wise γ estimates as compared to standard methods. Moreover, simulations showed that detection of release could be made more reliable and/or conducted using a smaller sample size using the proposed DPR estimator. Likewise, images of BPNDcomputed using DPR had substantially improved bias and variance properties. Application of the method in human subjects was demonstrated using11C-raclopride dynamic scans and a reward task, confirming the improved quality of the estimated parametric images using the proposed approach.

TITLE: The effects of various penalty parameter values in Q.Clear algorithm for rectal cancer detection on 18F-FDG images using a BGO-based PET/CT scanner: a phantom and clinical study

AUTHORS: Fatemeh Sadeghi, Peyman Sheikhzadeh, Saeed Farzanehfar, Pardis Ghafarian, Yalda Moafpurian, Mohammadreza Ay

JOURNAL: EJNMMI physics

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Background: The Q.Clear algorithm is a fully convergent iterative image reconstruction technique. We hypothesize that different PET/CT scanners with distinct crystal properties will require different optimal settings for the Q.Clear algorithm. Many studies have investigated the improvement of the Q.Clear reconstruction algorithm on PET/CT scanner with LYSO crystals and SiPM detectors. We propose an optimum penalization factor (β) for the detection of rectal cancer and its metastases using a BGO-based detector PET/CT system which obtained via accurate and comprehensive phantom and clinical studies.

Methods: 18F-FDG PET-CT scans were acquired from NEMA phantom with lesion-to-background ratio (LBR) of 2:1, 4:1, 8:1, and 15 patients with rectal cancer. Clinical lesions were classified into two size groups. OSEM and Q.Clear (β value of 100-500) reconstruction was applied. In Q.Clear, background variability (BV), contrast recovery (CR), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), SUVmax, and signal-to-background ratio (SBR) were evaluated and compared to OSEM.

Results: OSEM had 11.5-18.6% higher BV than Q.Clear using β value of 500. Conversely, RC from OSEM to Q.Clear using β value of 500 decreased by 3.3-7.7% for a sphere with a diameter of 10 mm and 2.5-5.1% for a sphere with a diameter of 37 mm. Furthermore, the increment of contrast using a β value of 500 was 5.2-8.1% in the smallest spheres compared to OSEM. When the β value was increased from 100 to 500, the SNR increased by 49.1% and 30.8% in the smallest and largest spheres at LBR 2:1, respectively. At LBR of 8:1, the relative difference of SNR between β value of 100 and 500 was 43.7% and 44.0% in the smallest and largest spheres, respectively. In the clinical study, as β increased from 100 to 500, the SUVmax decreased by 47.7% in small and 31.1% in large lesions. OSEM demonstrated the least SUVmax, SBR, and contrast. The decrement of SBR and contrast using OSEM were 13.6% and 12.9% in small and 4.2% and 3.4%, respectively, in large lesions.

Conclusions: Implementing Q.Clear enhances quantitative accuracies through a fully convergent voxel-based image approach, employing a penalization factor. In the BGO-based scanner, the optimal β value for small lesions ranges from 200 for LBR 2:1 to 300 for LBR 8:1. For large lesions, the optimal β value is between 400 for LBR 2:1 and 500 for LBR 8:1. We recommended β value of 300 for small lesions and β value of 500 for large lesions in clinical study.

TITLE: Enhancement of 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose PET Image Quality by Deep-Learning-Based Image Reconstruction Using Advanced Intelligent Clear-IQ Engine in Semiconductor-Based PET/CT Scanners

AUTHORS: Ken Yamagiwa, Junichi Tsuchiya, Kota Yokoyama, Ryosuke Watanabe, Koichiro Kimura, Mitsuhiro Kishino, Ukihide Tateishi

JOURNAL: Diagnostics (Basel, Switzerland)

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Deep learning (DL) image quality improvement has been studied for application to18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT). It is unclear, however, whether DL can increase the quality of images obtained with semiconductor-based PET/CT scanners. This study aimed to compare the quality of semiconductor-based PET/CT scanner images obtained by DL-based technology and conventional OSEM image with Gaussian postfilter. For DL-based data processing implementation, we used Advanced Intelligent Clear-IQ Engine (AiCE, Canon Medical Systems, Tochigi, Japan) and for OSEM images, Gaussian postfilter of 3 mm FWHM is used. Thirty patients who underwent semiconductor-based PET/CT scanner imaging between May 6, 2021, and May 19, 2021, were enrolled. We compared AiCE images and OSEM images and scored them for delineation, image noise, and overall image quality. We also measured standardized uptake values (SUVs) in tumors and healthy tissues and compared them between AiCE and OSEM. AiCE images scored significantly higher than OSEM images for delineation, image noise, and overall image quality. The Fleiss kappa value for the interobserver agreement was 0.57. Among the 21 SUV measurements in healthy organs, 11 (52.4%) measurements were significantly different between AiCE and OSEM images. More pathological lesions were detected in AiCE images as compared with OSEM images, with AiCE images showing higher SUVs for pathological lesions than OSEM images. AiCE can improve the quality of images acquired with semiconductor-based PET/CT scanners, including the noise level, contrast, and tumor detection capability.

AUTHORS: Junko Inoue Inukai, Munenobu Nogami, Miho Tachibana, Feibi Zeng, Tatsuya Nishitani, Kazuhiro Kubo, Takamichi Murakami

JOURNAL: Diagnostics (Basel, Switzerland)

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
This study evaluated the diagnostic value of a rapid whole-body fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) approach, combining Bayesian penalised likelihood (BPL) PET with an optimised β value and abbreviated MRI (abb-MRI). The study compares the diagnostic performance of this approach with the standard PET/MRI that utilises ordered subsets expectation maximisation (OSEM) PET and standard MRI (std-MRI). The optimal β value was determined by evaluating the noise-equivalent count (NEC) phantom, background variability, contrast recovery, recovery coefficient, and visual scores (VS) for OSEM and BPL with β100-1000 at 2.5-, 1.5-, and 1.0-min scans, respectively. Clinical evaluations were conducted for,, liver signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), lesion maximum standardised uptake value, lesion signal-to-background ratio, lesion SNR, and VS in 49 patients. The diagnostic performance of BPL/abb-MRI was retrospectively assessed for lesion detection and differentiation in 156 patients using VS. The optimal β values were β600 for a 1.5-min scan and β700 for a 1.0-min scan. BPL/abb-MRI at these β values was equivalent to OSEM/std-MRI for a 2.5-min scan. By combining BPL with optimal β and abb-MRI, rapid whole-body PET/MRI could be achieved in ≤1.5 min per bed position, while maintaining comparable diagnostic performance to standard PET/MRI.

TITLE: Comparison of 18F-FDG PET image quality and quantitative parameters between DPR and OSEM reconstruction algorithm in patients with lung cancer

AUTHORS: Ziyi Zhang, Wei Han, Zhehao Lyu, Hongyue Zhao, Xi Wang, Xinyue Zhang, Zeyu Wang, Peng Fu, Changjiu Zhao

JOURNAL: EJNMMI physics

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Objectives: The present study aimed to investigate the influence of the deep progressive learning reconstruction (DPR) algorithm on the18F-FDG PET image quality and quantitative parameters.

Methods: In this retrospective study, data were collected from 55 healthy individuals and 184 patients with primary malignant pulmonary tumors who underwent18F-FDG PET/CT examinations. PET data were reconstructed using the ordered subset expectation maximization (OSEM) and DPR algorithms. The influence of DPR algorithm on quantitative parameters was explored, including the SUVmax, SUVmean, standard deviation of SUV (SUVSD), metabolic tumor volume (MTV), total lesion glycolysis (TLG), and tumor-to-background uptake ratio (TBR). Finally, the differences in image quality parameters, including signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), between the two reconstruction algorithms were evaluated.

Results: DPR algorithm significantly reduced the SUVmaxand SUVSDof background tissues (all, P < 0.001) compared to OSEM algorithm, while no statistical difference was observed in SUVmeanbetween the two algorithms (all, P > 0.05). DPR algorithm notably increased the SUVmax, SUVmean, and TBR of lesions (all, P < 0.001) and reduced MTV (P = 0.005), with minimal differences in TLG noted between the reconstruction algorithms (P < 0.001). The percentage differences in SUVmax(P = 0.001), SUVmean(P = 0.005), and TBR (P = 0.001) between the two algorithms were significantly higher in solid nodules than in pure ground glass nodules (pGGNs). The ΔCNR between solid nodules (P = 0.031) and mixed ground glass nodules (P = 0.020) was greater than that between pGGNs. SNR and CNR obtained using the DPR algorithm were markedly improved compared to those determined using the OSEM algorithm (all, P < 0.001).

Conclusion: Under identical acquisition conditions, the DPR algorithm enhanced the accuracy of quantitative parameters in pulmonary lesions and potentially improved lesion detectability. The DPR algorithm increased image SNR and CNR compared to those obtained using the OSEM algorithm, significantly optimizing overall image quality. This advancement facilitated precise clinical diagnosis, underpinning its potential to significantly contribute to the field of medical imaging.

AUTHORS: Hessamoddin Roustaei, Nasim Norouzbeigi, Habibeh Vosoughi, Kamran Aryana

JOURNAL: Data in brief

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
This paper contains single-center prospective information showing illustrative examples of chemokine receptor-4 (CXCR4) targeting in high-grade glial brain tumors in treatment-naïve adult patients using a novel radiolabeled PET tracer: [68Ga]Ga-CXCR4 PET/CT. High-grade glioma is one of the most resistant malignancies to treatment. Despite major breakthroughs in diagnostic and therapeutic approaches, the overall 5-year survival rate remains in the 5-10% range. CXCR4 is a chemokine with the C-X-C motif that is overexpressed in high-grade gliomas. The 24 consecutive treatment- naïve enrolled patients underwent PET/CT images using the SIEMENS scanner (Biograph6 TrueV) and received the radiotracer intravenously. After approximately 60 min, the PET/CT acquisition was performed with a dedicated scanner and in 10 min time per bed position. The images were reconstructed and analyzed with the 3D-OSEM algorithm, applying point spread function (PSF) or resolution recovery algorithm (TrueX in Syngo ® software, Siemens Medical Solution), 3 iterations, and 21 subsets using a 3 mm Gaussian post-smoothing filter. These data would be potentially beneficial for automatic tumor delineation machine learning after augmented with other data retrieved from different papers as well as for differentiation between an active viable tumor vs. post-surgery/necrosis in indeterminate cases. The theranostics potential (CXCR4-tageted labeled beta emitters) is one of the most novel areas of interest for future studies.

TITLE: An integrated augmented reality surgical navigation platform using multi-modality imaging for guidance

AUTHORS: Harley H L Chan, Stephan K Haerle, Michael J Daly, Jinzi Zheng, Lauren Philp, Marco Ferrari, Catriona M Douglas, Jonathan C Irish

JOURNAL: PloS one

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
An integrated augmented reality (AR) surgical navigation system that potentially improves intra-operative visualization of concealed anatomical structures. Integration of real-time tracking technology with a laser pico-projector allows the surgical surface to be augmented by projecting virtual images of lesions and critical structures created by multimodality imaging. We aim to quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate the performance of a prototype interactive AR surgical navigation system through a series of pre-clinical studies. Four pre-clinical animal studies using xenograft mouse models were conducted to investigate system performance. A combination of CT, PET, SPECT, and MRI images were used to augment the mouse body during image-guided procedures to assess feasibility. A phantom with machined features was employed to quantitatively estimate the system accuracy. All the image-guided procedures were successfully performed. The tracked pico-projector correctly and reliably depicted virtual images on the animal body, highlighting the location of tumour and anatomical structures. The phantom study demonstrates the system was accurate to 0.55 ± 0.33mm. This paper presents a prototype real-time tracking AR surgical navigation system that improves visualization of underlying critical structures by overlaying virtual images onto the surgical site. This proof-of-concept pre-clinical study demonstrated both the clinical applicability and high precision of the system which was noted to be accurate to <1mm.

ABSTRACT:
Conventional medical imaging techniques use contrast agents that are chemically labeled, for example, iodine in the case of computed tomography, radioisotopes in the case of PET, or gadolinium in the case of MR imaging to create or enhance signal contrast and to visualize tissue compartments and features. Dynamic glucose-enhanced MR imaging represents a novel technique that uses natural, unlabeled d-glucose as a nontoxic biodegradable contrast agent in chemical exchange-sensitive MR imaging approaches.

ABSTRACT:
NeuroLF is a dedicated brain PET system with an octagonal prism shape housed in a scanner head that can be positioned around a patient's head. Because it does not have MR or CT capabilities, attenuation correction based on an estimation of the attenuation map is a crucial feature. In this article, we demonstrate this method on [18F]FDG PET brain scans performed with a low-resolution proof of concept prototype of NeuroLF called BPET. We perform an affine registration of a template PET scan to the uncorrected emission image, and then apply the resulting transform to the corresponding template attenuation map. Using a whole-body PET/CT system as reference, we quantitively show that this method yields comparable image quality (0.893 average correlation to reference scan) to using the reference µ-map as obtained from the CT scan of the imaged patient (0.908 average correlation). We conclude from this initial study that attenuation correction using template registration instead of a patient CT delivers similar results and is an option for patients undergoing brain PET.

TITLE: Quantitative Imaging in Inflammatory Arthritis: Between Tradition and Innovation

AUTHORS: Chiara Giraudo, Franz Kainberger, Mikael Boesen, Siegfried Trattnig

JOURNAL: Seminars in musculoskeletal radiology

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Radiologic imaging is crucial for diagnosing and monitoring rheumatic inflammatory diseases. Particularly the emerging approach of precision medicine has increased the interest in quantitative imaging. Extensive research has shown that ultrasound allows a quantification of direct signs such as bone erosions and synovial thickness. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (CT) contribute to the quantitative assessment of secondary signs such as osteoporosis or lean mass loss. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), using different techniques and sequences, permits in-depth evaluations. For instance, the perfusion of the inflamed synovium can be quantified by dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging or diffusion-weighted imaging, and cartilage injury can be assessed by mapping (T1ρ, T2). Furthermore, the increased metabolic activity characterizing the inflammatory response can be reliably assessed by hybrid imaging (positron emission tomography [PET]/CT, PET/MRI). Finally, advances in intelligent systems are pushing forward quantitative imaging. Complex mathematical algorithms of lesions' segmentation and advanced pattern recognition are showing promising results.

TITLE: Photorealistic three-dimensional visualization of fusion datasets: cinematic rendering of PET/CT

AUTHORS: Steven P Rowe, Martin G Pomper, Jeffrey P Leal, Robert Schneider, Sebastian Krüger, Linda C Chu, Elliot K Fishman

JOURNAL: Abdominal radiology (New York)

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Cinematic rendering (CR) is a method of photorealistic 3D visualization of volumetric imaging data. We applied this technique to fusion PET/CT data.

Methods: Two recent PET/CT cases were selected, one each of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeted18F-DCFPyL, and somatostatin-receptor-targeted68Ga-DOTATATE. Targeted radiotracers were selected in order to provide high-contrast images for this proof-of-principle study. Cinematic rendering was performed with an enhanced algorithm that incorporated internal lighting within the PET-avid organs and lesions to allow for a distinct visual signature.

Results: The use of internal lighting for PET data provided CR of fused PET/CT scans. The interpreting radiologist must make judicious use of presets and cut planes in order to ensure important findings are not missed.

Conclusions: CR of PET/CT data provides a photorealistic means of visualizing complex fusion imaging datasets. Such visualizations may aid anatomic understanding for surgical or procedural applications, may improve teaching of trainees, and may allow improved communication with patients.

TITLE: Investigation and optimization of PET-guided SPECT reconstructions for improved radionuclide therapy dosimetry estimates

AUTHORS: Harry Marquis, Kathy P Willowson, C Ross Schmidtlein, Dale L Bailey

JOURNAL: Frontiers in nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Introduction: To investigate and optimize the SPECTRE (Single Photon Emission Computed Theranostic REconstruction) reconstruction approach, using the hybrid kernelised expectation maximization (HKEM) algorithm implemented in the software for tomographic image reconstruction (STIR) software library, and to demonstrate the feasibility of performing algorithm exploration and optimization in 2D. Optimal SPECTRE parameters were investigated for the purpose of improving SPECT-based radionuclide therapy (RNT) dosimetry estimates.

Materials and methods: Using the NEMA IEC body phantom as the test object, SPECT data were simulated to model an early and late imaging time point following a typical therapeutic dose of 8 GBq of177Lu. A theranostic68Ga PET-prior was simulated for the SPECTRE reconstructions. The HKEM algorithm parameter space was investigated for SPECT-unique and PET-SPECT mutual features to characterize optimal SPECTRE parameters for the simulated data. Mean and maximum bias, coefficient of variation (COV %), recovery, SNR and root-mean-square error (RMSE) were used to facilitate comparisons between SPECTRE reconstructions and OSEM reconstructions with resolution modelling (OSEM_RM). 2D reconstructions were compared to those performed in 3D in order to evaluate the utility of accelerated algorithm optimization in 2D. Segmentation accuracy was evaluated using a 42% fixed threshold (FT) on the 3D reconstructed data.

Results: SPECTRE parameters that demonstrated improved image quality and quantitative accuracy were determined through investigation of the HKEM algorithm parameter space. OSEM_RM and SPECTRE reconstructions performed in 2D and 3D were qualitatively and quantitatively similar, with SPECTRE showing an average reduction in background COV % by a factor of 2.7 and 3.3 for the 2D case and 3D case respectively. The 42% FT analysis produced an average % volume difference from ground truth of 158% and 26%, for the OSEM_RM and SPECTRE reconstructions, respectively.

Conclusions: The SPECTRE reconstruction approach demonstrates significant potential for improved SPECT image quality, leading to more accurate RNT dosimetry estimates when conventional segmentation methods are used. Exploration and optimization of SPECTRE benefited from both fast reconstruction times afforded by first considering the 2D case. This is the first in-depth exploration of the SPECTRE reconstruction approach, and as such, it reveals several insights for reconstructing SPECT data using PET side information.

TITLE: Respiratory motion correction for enhanced quantification of hepatic lesions in simultaneous PET and DCE-MR imaging

AUTHORS: Matteo Ippoliti, Mathias Lukas, Winfried Brenner, Imke Schatka, Christian Furth, Tobias Schaeffter, Marcus R Makowski, Christoph Kolbitsch

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Simultaneous positron-emission tomography (PET)-magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is a hybrid technique in oncological hepatic imaging combining soft-tissue and functional contrast of dynamic contrast enhanced MR (DCE-MR) with metabolic information from PET. In this context, respiratory motion represents a major challenge by introducing blurring, artifacts and misregistration in the liver. In this work, we propose a free-breathing 3D non-rigid respiratory motion correction framework for simultaneously acquired DCE-MR and PET data, which makes use of higher spatial resolution MR data to derive motion information used directly during image reconstruction to minimize image blurring and motion artifacts. The main aim was to increase contrast of hepatic metastases to improve their detection and characterization. DCE-MR data were acquired at 3T through a golden radial phase encoding scheme, enabling derivation of motion fields. These were used in the motion compensated image reconstruction of DCE-MR time-series (48 time-points, 6 s temporal resolution, 1.5 mm isotropic spatial resolution) and 3D PET activity map, which was subsequently interpolated to the DCE-MR resolution. The extended Tofts model was fitted to DCE-MR data, obtaining functional parametric maps related to perfusion such as the endothelial permeability (Kt). Fifty-seven hepatic metastases were identified and analyzed. Quantitative evaluations of motion correction in PET images demonstrated average percentage increases of 16% ± 5% (mean ± SD) in Contrast (C), 18% ± 6% in SUVmeanand 14% ± 2% in SUVmax, while DCE-MR andKtscored contrast-to-noise-ratio increases of 64% ± 3% and 90% ± 6%, respectively. Motion-corrected data visually showed improved image contrast of hepatic metastases and effectively reduced blurring and motion artefacts. Scatter plots of SUVmeanversusKtsuggested that the proposed framework improved differentiation ofKtmeasurements. The presented motion correction framework for simultaneously acquired PET-DCE-MR data provides accurately aligned images with increased contrast of hepatic lesions allowing for improved detection and characterization.

TITLE: Performance evaluation in [18F]Florbetaben brain PET images classification using 3D Convolutional Neural Network

AUTHORS: Seung-Yeon Lee, Hyeon Kang, Jong-Hun Jeong, Do-Young Kang

JOURNAL: PloS one

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
High accuracy has been reported in deep learning classification for amyloid brain scans, an important factor in Alzheimer's disease diagnosis. However, the possibility of overfitting should be considered, as this model is fitted with sample data. Therefore, we created and evaluated an [18F]Florbetaben amyloid brain positron emission tomography (PET) scan classification model with a Dong-A University Hospital (DAUH) dataset based on a convolutional neural network (CNN), and performed external validation with the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset. Spatial normalization, count normalization, and skull stripping preprocessing were performed on the DAUH and external datasets. However, smoothing was only performed on the external dataset. Three types of models were used, depending on their structure: Inception3D, ResNet3D, and VGG3D. After training with 80% of the DAUH dataset, an appropriate model was selected, and the rest of the DAUH dataset was used for model evaluation. The generalization potential of the selected model was then validated using the external dataset. The accuracy of the model evaluation for Inception3D, ResNet3D, and VGG3D was 95.4%, 92.0%, and 97.7%, and the accuracy of the external validation was 76.7%, 67.1%, and 85.3%, respectively. Inception3D and ResNet3D were retrained with the external dataset; then, the area under the curve was compared to determine the binary classification performance with a significance level of less than 0.05. When external validation was performed again after fine tuning, the performance improved to 15.3%p for Inception3D and 16.9%p for ResNet3D. In [18F]Florbetaben amyloid brain PET scan classification using CNN, the generalization potential can be seen through external validation. When there is a significant difference between the model classification performance and the external validation, changing the model structure or fine tuning the model can help improve the classification performance, and the optimal model can also be found by collaborating through a web-based open platform.

AUTHORS: Yansong Zhu, Benjamin A Spencer, Zhaoheng Xie, Edwin K Leung, Reimund Bayerlein, Negar Omidvari, Simon R Cherry, Jinyi Qi, Ramsey D Badawi, Guobao Wang

JOURNAL: Proceedings of SPIE--the International Society for Optical Engineering

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) enables material decomposition for tissues and produces additional information for PET/CT imaging to potentially improve the characterization of diseases. PET-enabled DECT (PDECT) allows the generation of PET and DECT images simultaneously with a conventional PET/CT scanner without the need for a second x-ray CT scan. In PDECT, high-energyγ-ray CT (GCT) images at 511 keV are obtained from time-of-flight (TOF) PET data and are combined with the existing x-ray CT images to form DECT imaging. We have developed a kernel-based maximum-likelihood attenuation and activity (MLAA) method that uses x-ray CT images as a priori information for noise suppression. However, our previous studies focused on GCT image reconstruction at the PET image resolution which is coarser than the image resolution of the x-ray CT. In this work, we explored the feasibility of generating super-resolution GCT images at the corresponding CT resolution. The study was conducted using both phantom and patient scans acquired with the uEXPLORER total-body PET/CT system. GCT images at the PET resolution with a pixel size of 4.0 mm × 4.0 mm and at the CT resolution with a pixel size of 1.2 mm × 1.2 mm were reconstructed using both the standard MLAA and kernel MLAA methods. The results indicated that the GCT images at the CT resolution had sharper edges and revealed more structural details compared to the images reconstructed at the PET resolution. Furthermore, images from the kernel MLAA method showed substantially improved image quality compared to those obtained with the standard MLAA method.

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

ABSTRACT:
Objective.This paper introduces a novel PET imaging methodology called 3-dimensional positron imaging (3Dπ), which integrates total-body coverage, time-of-flight (TOF) technology, ultra-low dose imaging capabilities, and ultra-fast readout electronics inspired by emerging technology from the DarkSide collaboration.Approach.The study evaluates the performance of 3Dπusing Monte Carlo simulations based on NEMA NU 2-2018 protocols. The methodology employs a homogenous, monolithic scintillator composed of liquid argon (LAr) doped with xenon (Xe) with silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) operating at cryogenic temperatures.Main results.Substantial improvements in system performance are observed, with the 3Dπsystem achieving a noise equivalent count rate of 3.2 Mcps at 17.3 kBq ml-1, continuing to increase up to 4.3 Mcps at 40 kBq ml-1. Spatial resolution measurements show an average FWHM of 2.7 mm across both axial positions. The system exhibits superior sensitivity, with values reaching 373 kcps MBq-1with a line source at the center of the field of view. Additionally, 3Dπachieves a TOF resolution of 151 ps at 5.3 kBq ml-1, highlighting its potential to produce high-quality images with reduced noise levels.Significance.The study underscores the potential of 3Dπin improving PET imaging performance, offering the potential for shorter scan times and reduced radiation exposure for patients. The Xe-doped LAr offers advantages such as fast scintillation, enhanced light yield, and cost-effectiveness. Future research will focus on optimizing system geometry and further refining reconstruction algorithms to exploit the strengths of 3Dπfor clinical applications.

TITLE: EARL compliance measurements on the biograph vision Quadra PET/CT system with a long axial field of view

AUTHORS: George A Prenosil, Michael Hentschel, Thilo Weitzel, Hasan Sari, Kuangyu Shi, Ali Afshar-Oromieh, Axel Rominger

JOURNAL: EJNMMI physics

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Background: Our aim was to determine sets of reconstruction parameters for the Biograph Vision Quadra (Siemens Healthineers) PET/CT system that result in quantitative images compliant with the European Association of Nuclear Medicine Research Ltd. (EARL) criteria. Using the Biograph Vision 600 (Siemens Healthineers) PET/CT technology but extending the axial field of view to 106 cm, gives the Vision Quadra currently an around fivefold higher sensitivity over the Vision 600 with otherwise comparable spatial resolution. Therefore, we also investigated how the number of incident positron decays-i.e., exposure-affects EARL compliance. This will allow estimating a minimal acquisition time or a minimal applied dose in clinical scans while retaining data comparability.

Methods: We measured activity recovery curves on a NEMA IEC body phantom filled with an aqueous18F solution and a sphere to background ratio of 10-1 according to the latest EARL guidelines. Reconstructing 3570 image sets with varying OSEM PSF iterations, post-reconstruction Gaussian filter full width at half maximum (FWHM), and varying exposure from 59 kDecays/ml (= 3 s frame duration) to 59.2 MDecays/ml (= 1 h), allowed us to determine sets of parameters to achieve compliance with the current EARL 1 and EARL 2 standards. Recovery coefficients (RCs) were calculated for the metrics RCmax, RCmean, and RCpeak, and the respective recovery curves were analyzed for monotonicity. The background's coefficient of variation (COV) was also calculated.

Results: Using 6 iterations, 5 subsets and 7.8 mm Gauss filtering resulted in optimal EARL1 compliance and recovery curve monotonicity in all analyzed frames, except in the 3 s frames. Most robust EARL2 compliance and monotonicity were achieved with 2 iterations, 5 subsets, and 3.6 mm Gauss FWHM in frames with durations between 30 s and 10 min. RCpeakonly impeded EARL2 compliance in the 10 s and 3 s frames.

Conclusions: While EARL1 compliance was robust over most exposure ranges, EARL2 compliance required exposures between 1.2 MDecays/ml to 11.5 MDecays/ml. The Biograph Vision Quadra's high sensitivity makes frames as short as 10 s feasible for comparable quantitative images. Lowering EARL2 RCmaxlimits closer to unity would possibly even permit shorter frames.

TITLE: Continuous bed motion in a silicon photomultiplier-based scanner provides equivalent spatial resolution and image quality in whole body PET images at similar acquisition times using the step-and-shoot method

AUTHORS: Kodai Kumamoto, Hideaki Sato, Yuji Tsutsui, Shinichi Awamoto, Yasuo Yamashita, Shingo Baba, Masayuki Sasaki

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear medicine technology

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
This study investigated the spatial resolution and image quality of the continuous bed motion (CBM) method in a sensitive silicon photomultiplier (SiPM)-based positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) system compared with the traditional step-and-shoot (SS) method.Methods:Siemens Biograph Vision was used in this study. Data acquisition using the SS method was performed for 3 min per bed. In the CBM method, the bed speed ranged from 0.5 to 3.3 mm/s. The acquisition time equivalent to the SS method was 1.1 mm/s for 2-bed ranges and 0.8 mm/s for seven-bed ranges. The spatial resolution was investigated using18F point sources and evaluated using the full width at half maximum. Image quality was investigated using a National Electrical Manufacturers Association International Electrotechnical Commission body phantom with six spheres 10-, 13-, 17-, 22-, 28-, and 37-mm inner diameters. The radioactivity concentration ratio of the18F solution in all spheres and the background was approximately 4:1. The detectability of each sphere was visually evaluated on a five-step score. Image quality was physically evaluated using the noise equivalent count rate (NECphantom), contrast percentage of the 10-mm hot sphere (QH,10mm), background variability percentage (N10mm), and contrast-noise ratio (QH,10mm/N10mm).Results:The spatial resolution was not affected by the difference of acquisition methods and bed speeds. The detectability of the 10-mm sphere with a bed speed of 2.2 mm/s or faster was significantly inferior to that of the SS 2-bed method. In evaluating image quality, no significant difference in the contrast percentage was observed among the acquisition methods and speeds in the CBM method. However, the increasing bed speed in the CBM method increased the N10mm and decreased the NECphantom. When comparing the SS 2-bed method with the CBM method at 0.8 mm/s, no significant differences in all parameters were observed.Conclusion:In a SiPM-based PET/CT scanner, the CBM method provides equivalent spatial resolution and image quality in whole body PET images with same acquisition time using the SS method.

AUTHORS: Alberto Miceli, Stefano Raffa, Maria Isabella Donegani, Vanessa Cossu, Silvia Morbelli, Cecilia Marini, Gianmario Sambuceti, Matteo Bauckneht

JOURNAL: Current radiopharmaceuticals

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Sarcoidosis is a systemic inflammatory disease of unknown etiology, pathologically characterized by non-caseating granulomas involving several organs and tissues. This pathological process can eventually affect the heart during his course leading to fibrosis associated with systolic dysfunction, conduction disturbance, and even sudden cardiac death. Due to this prognostic impact, diagnosis is crucial to optimize clinical management. The low sensitivity of endomyocardial biopsy and its invasive nature prevents its application as a first-line diagnostic approach. Thus, several efforts have been dedicated to the identification of advanced imaging tools for the diagnosis and monitoring of cardiac involvement in systemic sarcoidosis, including Positron Emission Tomography (PET). Starting from strengths and disadvantages of 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) PET imaging, the present narrative review will summarize state of the art and future perspectives about radiotracers other than 18F-FDG of potential interest in the field of CS, including somatostatin receptor- ligands, proliferation markers and hypoxia displaying agents.

AUTHORS: Lorenzo Mercolli, Konstantinos Zeimpekis, George A Prenosil, Hasan Sari, Hendrik G Rathke, Axel Rominger, Kunagyu Shi

JOURNAL: Physica medica : PM : an international journal devoted to the applications of physics to medicine and biology : official journal of the Italian Association of Biomedical Physics (AIFB)

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: The physical properties of yttrium-90 (90Y) allow for imaging with positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT). The increased sensitivity of long axial field-of-view (LAFOV) PET/CT scanners possibly allows to overcome the small branching ratio for positron production from90Y decays and to improve for the post-treatment dosimetry of90Y of selective internal radiation therapy.

Methods: For the challenging case of an image quality body phantom, we compare a full Monte Carlo (MC) dose calculation with the results from the two commercial software packages Simplicit90Y and Hermes. The voxel dosimetry module of Hermes relies on the90Y images taken with a LAFOV PET/CT, while the MC and Simplicit90Y dose calculations are image independent.

Results: The resulting doses from the MC calculation and Simplicit90Y agree well within the error margins. The image-based dose calculation with Hermes, however, consistently underestimates the dose. This is due to the mismatch of the activity distribution in the PET images and the size of the volume of interest. We found that only for the smallest phantom sphere there is a statistically significant dependence of the Hermes dose on the image reconstruction parameters and scan time.

Conclusion: Our study shows that Simplicit90Y's local deposition model can provide a reliable dose estimate. On the other hand, the image based dose calculation suffers from the suboptimal reconstruction of the90Y distribution in small structures.

TITLE: Kinetic model-informed deep learning for multiplexed PET image separation

AUTHORS: Bolin Pan, Paul K Marsden, Andrew J Reader

JOURNAL: EJNMMI physics

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Background: Multiplexed positron emission tomography (mPET) imaging can measure physiological and pathological information from different tracers simultaneously in a single scan. Separation of the multiplexed PET signals within a single PET scan is challenging due to the fact that each tracer gives rise to indistinguishable 511 keV photon pairs, and thus no unique energy information for differentiating the source of each photon pair.

Methods: Recently, many applications of deep learning for mPET image separation have been concentrated on pure data-driven methods, e.g., training a neural network to separate mPET images into single-tracer dynamic/static images. These methods use over-parameterized networks with only a very weak inductive prior. In this work, we improve the inductive prior of the deep network by incorporating a general kinetic model based on spectral analysis. The model is incorporated, along with deep networks, into an unrolled image-space version of an iterative fully 4D PET reconstruction algorithm.

Results: The performance of the proposed method was evaluated on a simulated brain image dataset for dual-tracer [F]FDG+[C]MET PET image separation. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve separation performance comparable to that obtained with single-tracer imaging. In addition, the proposed method outperformed the model-based separation methods (the conventional voxel-wise multi-tracer compartment modeling method (v-MTCM) and the image-space dual-tracer version of the fully 4D PET image reconstruction algorithm (IS-F4D)), as well as a pure data-driven separation [using a convolutional encoder-decoder (CED)], with fewer training examples.

Conclusions: This work proposes a kinetic model-informed unrolled deep learning method for mPET image separation. In simulation studies, the method proved able to outperform both the conventional v-MTCM method and a pure data-driven CED with less training data.

TITLE: Artificial intelligence in molecular imaging

AUTHORS: Edward H Herskovits

JOURNAL: Annals of translational medicine

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
AI has, to varying degrees, affected all aspects of molecular imaging, from image acquisition to diagnosis. During the last decade, the advent of deep learning in particular has transformed medical image analysis. Although the majority of recent advances have resulted from neural-network models applied to image segmentation, a broad range of techniques has shown promise for image reconstruction, image synthesis, differential-diagnosis generation, and treatment guidance. Applications of AI for drug design indicate the way forward for using AI to facilitate molecular-probe design, which is still in its early stages. Deep-learning models have demonstrated increased efficiency and image quality for PET reconstruction from sinogram data. Generative adversarial networks (GANs), which are paired neural networks that are jointly trained to generate and classify images, have found applications in modality transformation, artifact reduction, and synthetic-PET-image generation. Some AI applications, based either partly or completely on neural-network approaches, have demonstrated superior differential-diagnosis generation relative to radiologists. However, AI models have a history of brittleness, and physicians and patients may not trust AI applications that cannot explain their reasoning. To date, the majority of molecular-imaging applications of AI have been confined to research projects, and are only beginning to find their ways into routine clinical workflows via commercialization and, in some cases, integration into scanner hardware. Evaluation of actual clinical products will yield more realistic assessments of AI's utility in molecular imaging.

ABSTRACT:
Absolute quantification of regional tissue concentration of radioactivity in positron emission tomography (PET) is a critical parameter-of-interest across various clinical and research applications and is affected by a complex interplay of factors including scanner calibration, data corrections, and image reconstruction. The emergence of long axial field-of-view (FOV) PET systems widens the dynamic range accessible to PET and creates new opportunities in reducing scan time and radiation dose, delayed or low radioactivity imaging, as well as kinetic modeling of the entire human. However, these imaging regimes impose challenging conditions for accurate quantification due to constraints from image reconstruction, low count conditions, as well as large and rapidly changing radioactivity distribution across a large axial FOV. We comprehensively evaluated the quantitative accuracy of the uEXPLORER total-body scanner in conditions that encompass existing and potential imaging applications (such as dynamic imaging and ultralow-dose imaging) using a set of total-body specific phantom and human measurements. Through these evaluations we demonstrated a relative count rate accuracy of ±3%-4% using the NEMA NU 2-2018 protocol, an axial uniformity spread of ±3% across the central 90% axial FOV, and a 3% activity bias spread from 17 to 474 MBq18F-FDG in a 210 cm long cylindrical phantom. Region-of-interest quantification spread of 1% was found by simultaneously scanning three NEMA NU 2 image quality phantoms, as well as relatively stable volume-of-interest quantification across 0.2%-100% of total counts through re-sampled datasets. In addition, an activity bias spread of -2% to +1% post-bolus injections in human subjects was found. Larger bias changes during the bolus injection phase in humans indicated the difficulty in providing accurate PET data corrections for complex activity distributions across a large dynamic range. Our results overall indicated that the quantitative performance achieved with the uEXPLORER scanner was uniform across the axial FOV and provided the accuracy necessary to support a wide range of imaging applications.

TITLE: Feasibility of positron range correction in 82-Rubidium cardiac PET/CT

AUTHORS: Malte Jensen, Simon Bentsen, Andreas Clemmensen, Jacob Kildevang Jensen, Johanne Madsen, Jonas Rossing, Anna Laier, Philip Hasbak, Andreas Kjaer, Rasmus Sejersten Ripa

JOURNAL: EJNMMI physics

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Background: Myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) using positron emission tomography (PET) tracers is an essential tool in investigating diseases and treatment responses in cardiology.82Rubidium (82Rb)-PET imaging is advantageous for MPI due to its short half-life, but cannot be used for small animal research due to the long positron range. We aimed to correct for this, enabling MPI with82Rb-PET in rats.

Methods: The effect of positron range correction (PRC) on82Rb-PET was examined using two phantoms and in vivo on rats. A NEMA NU-4-inspired phantom was used for image quality evaluation (%standard deviation (%SD), spillover ratio (SOR) and recovery coefficient (RC)). A cardiac phantom was used for assessing spatial resolution. Two rats underwent rest82Rb-PET to optimize number of iterations, type of PRC and respiratory gating.

Results: NEMA NU-4 metrics (no PRC vs PRC): %SD 0.087 versus 0.103; SOR (air) 0.022 versus 0.002, SOR (water) 0.059 versus 0.019; RC (3 mm) 0.219 versus 0.584, RC (4 mm) 0.300 versus 0.874, RC (5 mm) 0.357 versus 1.197. Cardiac phantom full width at half maximum (FWHM) and full width at tenth maximum (FWTM) (no PRC vs. PRC): FWTM 6.73 mm versus 3.26 mm (true: 3 mm), FWTM 9.27 mm versus 7.01 mm. The in vivo scans with respiratory gating had a homogeneous myocardium clearly distinguishable from the blood pool.

Conclusion: PRC improved the spatial resolution for the phantoms and in vivo at the expense of slightly more noise. Combined with respiratory gating, the spatial resolution achieved using PRC should allow for quantitative MPI in small animals.

TITLE: A NIM PET/CT phantom for evaluating the PET image quality of micro-lesions and the performance parameters of CT

AUTHORS: Shujie Lu, Peng Zhang, Chengwei Li, Jie Sun, Wenli Liu, Pu Zhang

JOURNAL: BMC medical imaging

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Background: The commonly used NEMA IEC Body phantom has a number of defects, hindering its application for detecting micro-lesions and measuring the performance parameters of computed tomography (CT). This study aimed to propose a PET/CT phantom designed by National Institute of Metrology (NIM), China, which is capable of simultaneously testing the performance of PET and CT systems, and to evaluate the quality of imaging.

Methods: The phantom developed in the present study, the NIM PET/CT phantom, is composed of a PET imaging module and a CT imaging module, and these modules are connected together through bolts, which can simultaneously measure the imaging performance of PET and CT systems. Hot spheres were filled with 4:1 sphere-to-background activity concentration using18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG), and cold spheres were filled with non-radioactive water. We compared the results of imaging obtained from the NIM PET/CT phantom and the NEMA IEC Body phantom to assess their diagnostic efficacy. In order to evaluate the generalization ability of the NIM PET/CT phantom, three different PET/CT systems were used to scan on the same scanning protocol. To evaluate the effects of image reconstruction algorithms on image quality assessment, ordered subset expectation maximization (OSEM), OSEM-point-spread function (PSF), OSEM-TOF, and OSEM-PSF-TOF algorithms were employed.

Results: The imaging quality of the NIM PET/CT phantom and the NEMA IEC Body phantom was relatively consistent. The NIM PET/CT phantom could detect 7 mm spheres without influencing the imaging quality. It was found that PSF reconstruction exhibited to reduce the speed of convergence, the contrast and background variability of spheres (13-28 mm) were significantly improved after two iterations. In addition to improve the image contrast and background variability, TOF could markedly improve the overall image quality and instrument detection limit. TOF-PSF could noticeably reduce noise level, enhance imaging details, and improve quality of imaging.

Conclusions: The results showed that in comparison with the NEMA IEC Body phantom, the NIM PET/CT phantom outperformed in evaluating the PET image quality of micro-lesions and the performance parameters of CT.

TITLE: 3DFRINet: A Framework for the Detection and Diagnosis of Fracture Related Infection in Low Extremities Based on 18F-FDG PET/CT 3D Images

AUTHORS: Chengfan Li, Liangbing Nie, Zhenkui Sun, Xuehai Ding, Quanyong Luo, Chentian Shen

JOURNAL: Computerized medical imaging and graphics : the official journal of the Computerized Medical Imaging Society

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Fracture related infection (FRI) is one of the most devastating complications after fracture surgery in the lower extremities, which can lead to extremely high morbidity and medical costs. Therefore, early comprehensive evaluation and accurate diagnosis of patients are critical for appropriate treatment, prevention of complications, and good prognosis.18Fluoro-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT) is one of the most commonly used medical imaging modalities for diagnosing FRI. With the development of deep learning, more neural networks have been proposed and become powerful computer-aided diagnosis tools in medical imaging. Therefore, a fully automated two-stage framework for FRI detection and diagnosis, 3DFRINet (Three Dimension FRI Network), is proposed for18F-FDG PET/CT 3D imaging. The first stage can effectively extract and fuse the features of both modalities to accurately locate the lesion by the dual-branch design and attention module. The second stage reduces the dimensionality of the image by using the maximum intensity projection, which retains the effective features while reducing the computational effort and achieving excellent diagnostic performance. The diagnostic performance of lesions reached 91.55% accuracy, 0.9331 AUC, and 0.9250 F1 score. 3DFRINet has an advantage over six nuclear medicine experts in each classification metric. The statistical analysis shows that 3DFRINet is equivalent or superior to the primary nuclear medicine physicians and comparable to the senior nuclear medicine physicians. In conclusion, this study first proposed a method based on18F-FDG PET/CT three-dimensional imaging for FRI location and diagnosis. This method shows superior lesion detection rate and diagnostic efficiency and therefore has good prospects for clinical application.

TITLE: Asphericity of tumor FDG uptake in non-small cell lung cancer: reproducibility and implications for harmonization in multicenter studies

AUTHORS: Julian M M Rogasch, Christian Furth, Stephanie Bluemel, Piotr Radojewski, Holger Amthauer, Frank Hofheinz

JOURNAL: EJNMMI research

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Background: Asphericity (ASP) of the primary tumor's metabolic tumor volume (MTV) in FDG-PET/CT is independently predictive for survival in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, comparability between PET systems may be limited. Therefore, reproducibility of ASP was evaluated at varying image reconstruction and acquisition times to assess feasibility of ASP assessment in multicenter studies.

Methods: This is a retrospective study of 50 patients with NSCLC (female 20; median age 69 years) undergoing pretherapeutic FDG-PET/CT (median 3.7 MBq/kg; 180 s/bed position). Reconstruction used OSEM with TOF4/16(iterations 4; subsets 16; in-plane filter 2.0, 6.4 or 9.5 mm), TOF4/8(4 it; 8 ss; filter 2.0/6.0/9.5 mm), PSF + TOF2/17(2 it; 17 ss; filter 2.0/7.0/10.0 mm) or Bayesian-penalized likelihood (Q.Clear; beta, 600/1750/4000). Resulting reconstructed spatial resolution (FWHM) was determined from hot sphere inserts of a NEMA IEC phantom. Data with approx. 5-mm FWHM were retrospectively smoothed to achieve 7-mm FWHM. List mode data were rebinned for acquisition times of 120/90/60 s. Threshold-based delineation of primary tumor MTV was followed by evaluation of relative ASP/SUVmax/MTV differences between datasets and resulting proportions of discordantly classified cases.

Results: Reconstructed resolution for narrow/medium/wide in-plane filter (or low/medium/high beta) was approx. 5/7/9 mm FWHM. Comparing different pairs of reconstructed resolution between TOF4/8, PSF + TOF2/17, Q.Clear and the reference algorithm TOF4/16, ASP differences was lowest at FWHM of 7 versus 7 mm. Proportions of discordant cases (ASP > 19.5% vs. ≤ 19.5%) were also lowest at 7 mm (TOF4/8, 2%; PSF + TOF2/17, 4%; Q.Clear, 10%). Smoothing of 5-mm data to 7-mm FWHM significantly reduced discordant cases (TOF4/8, 38% reduced to 2%; PSF + TOF2/17, 12% to 4%; Q.Clear, 10% to 6%), resulting in proportions comparable to original 7-mm data. Shorter acquisition time only increased proportions of discordant cases at < 90 s.

Conclusions: ASP differences were mainly determined by reconstructed spatial resolution, and multicenter studies should aim at comparable FWHM (e.g., 7 mm; determined by in-plane filter width). This reduces discordant cases (high vs. low ASP) to an acceptable proportion for TOF and PSF + TOF of < 5% (Q.Clear: 10%). Data with better resolution (i.e., lower FWHM) could be retrospectively smoothed to the desired FWHM, resulting in a comparable number of discordant cases.

JOURNAL: Journal of clinical medicine

ABSTRACT:
Background:Image reconstruction is crucial for improving overall image quality and diagnostic accuracy. Q.Clear is a novel reconstruction algorithm that reduces image noise. The aim of the present study is to assess the preferred Q.Clear β-level for digital [68Ga]Ga-DOTANOC PET/CT reconstruction vs. standard reconstruction (STD) for both overall scan and single-lesion visualization.Methods:Inclusion criteria: (1) patients with/suspected neuroendocrine tumors included in a prospective observational monocentric study between September 2019 and January 2022; (2) [68Ga]Ga-DOTANOC digital PET/CT and contrast-enhanced-CT (ceCT) performed at our center at the same time. Images were reconstructed with STD and with Q.Clear β-levels 800, 1000, and 1600. Scans were blindly reviewed by three nuclear-medicine experts: the preferred β-level reconstruction was independently chosen for the visual quality of both the overall scan and the most avid target lesion < 1 cm (t) and >1 cm (T). PET/CT results were compared to ceCT. Semiquantitative analysis was performed (STD vs. β1600) in T and t concordant at both PET/CT and ceCT. Subgroup analysis was also performed in patients presenting discordant t.Results: Overall, 52 patients were included. β1600 reconstruction was considered superior over the others for both overall scan quality and single-lesion detection in all cases. The only significantly different (p< 0.001) parameters between β1600 and STD were signal-to-noise liver ratio and standard deviation of the liver background. Lesion-dependent parameters were not significantly different in concordant T (n= 37) and t (n= 10). Among 26 discordant t, when PET was positive, all findings were confirmed as malignant.Conclusions: β1600 Q.Clear reconstruction for [68Ga]Ga-DOTANOC imaging is feasible and improves image quality for both overall and small-lesion assessment.

TITLE: Design and Construction of a PET-Compatible Double-Tuned 1H/31P MR Head Coil

AUTHORS: A Avdo Celik, Chang-Hoon Choi, Lutz Tellmann, Claire Rick, N Jon Shah, Jorg Felder

JOURNAL: IEEE transactions on medical imaging

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Simultaneous MR-PET is an increasingly popular multimodal imaging technique that is able to combine metabolic information obtained from PET with anatomical/functional information from MRI. One of the key technological challenges of the technique is the integration of a PET-transparent MR coil system, a solution to which is demonstrated here for a double-tuned1H/31P head coil at 3 T. Two single-resonant birdcage coils tuned to the1H and31P resonances were arranged in an interleaved fashion and electrically decoupled with the use of trap circuits. All high 511 keV quanta absorbing components were arranged outside the PET field-of-view in order to minimize count rate reduction. The materials inside the PET field-of-view were carefully evaluated and chosen for minimum impact on the PET image quality. As far as possible, the coil case was geometrically optimized to avoid sharp transitions in attenuation, which may potentially result in streaking artefacts during PET image reconstruction. The coil caused a count rate loss of just above 5% when inserted into the PET detector ring. Except for the anterior region, which was designed to maintain free openings for increased patient comfort, an almost uniform distribution of 511 keV attenuation was maintained around the circumference of the coil. MR-related performance for both nuclei was similar or slightly better than that of a commercial double-tuned coil, despite the MR-PET coil having a close-fitting RF screen to shield the PET and MR electronics from possible electromagnetic interferences.

TITLE: Impact of time of flight and point spread function on quantitative parameters of lung lesions in 18F-FDG PET/CT

AUTHORS: Kemin Huang, Yanlin Feng, Weitang Liang, Lin Li

JOURNAL: BMC medical imaging

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Background: Image reconstruction algorithm is one of the important factors affecting the quantitative parameters of PET/CT. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of time of flight (TOF) and point spread function (PSF) on quantitative parameters of lung lesions in18F-FDG PET/CT.

Methods: This retrospective study evaluated 60 lung lesions in 39 patients who had undergone18F-fluoro-deoxy-glucose (FDG) PET/CT. All lesions larger than 10 mm in diameter were included in the study. The PET data were reconstructed with a baseline ordered-subsets expectation-maximization (OSEM) algorithm, OSEM + PSF, OSEM + TOF and OSEM + TOF + PSF respectively. The differences of maximum standard uptake value (SUVmax), mean standard uptake value (SUVmean), metabolic tumor volume (MTV), total lesion glycolysis (TLG)and signal to noise ratio (SNR)were compared among different reconstruction algorithms.

Results: Compared with OSEM reconstruction, using OSEM + TOF + PSF increased SUVmean and SUVmax by 23.73% and 22.71% respectively, and SNR increased by 70.18%, MTV decreased by 23.84% (p < 0.01). The percentage difference was significantly higher in smaller lesions (diameter 10-22 mm) than in larger lesions (diameter 23-44 mm), and significantly higher in low contrast lesions (SNR ≤ 15.31) than in high contrast lesions (SNR > 15.31). The difference of TLG among various reconstruction algorithms is relatively small, the highest value is - 6.48% of OSEM + TOF + PSF, and the lowest value is 0.81% of OSEM + TOF.

Conclusion: TOF and PSF significantly affected the quantitative parameters of lung lesions in18F-FDG PET/CT. OSEM + TOF + PSF can significantly increased SUVmax, SUVmean and SNR, and significantly reduce MTV, especially in small lesions and low contrast lesions. TLG can be relatively stable in different reconstruction algorithms.

TITLE: 3D full-dose brain-PET volume recovery from low-dose data through deep learning: quantitative assessment and clinical evaluation

AUTHORS: Rui Guo, Jiale Wang, Ying Miao, Xinyu Zhang, Song Xue, Yu Zhang, Kuangyu Shi, Biao Li, Guoyan Zheng

JOURNAL: European radiology

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Objectives: Low-dose (LD) PET imaging would lead to reduced image quality and diagnostic efficacy. We propose a deep learning (DL) method to reduce radiotracer dosage for PET studies while maintaining diagnostic quality.

Methods: This retrospective study was performed on 456 participants respectively scanned by three different PET scanners with two different tracers. A DL method called spatially aware noise reduction network (SANR) was proposed to recover 3D full-dose (FD) PET volumes from LD data. The performance of SANR was compared with a 2D DL method taking regular FD PET volumes as the reference. Wilcoxon signed-rank test was conducted to compare the image quality metrics across different DL denoising methods. For clinical evaluation, two nuclear medicine physicians examined the recovered FD PET volumes using a 5-point grading scheme (5 = excellent) and gave a binary decision (negative or positive) for diagnostic quality assessment.

Results: Statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) were found in terms of image quality metrics when SANR was compared with the 2D DL method. For clinical evaluation, SANR achieved a lesion detection accuracy of 95.3% (95% CI: 90.1%, 100%), while the reference full-dose PET volumes obtained a lesion detection accuracy of 98.4% (95% CI: 95.4%, 100%). In Alzheimer's disease diagnosis, both the reference FD PET volumes and the FD PET volumes recovered by SANR exhibited the same accuracy.

Conclusion: Compared with reference FD PET, LD PET denoised by the proposed approach significantly reduced radiotracer dosage and showed noninferior diagnostic performance in brain lesion detection and Alzheimer's disease diagnosis.

Key points: Question The current trend in PET imaging is to reduce injected dosage, which leads to low-quality PET images and reduces diagnostic efficacy. Findings The proposed deep learning method could recover diagnostic quality PET images from data acquired with a markedly reduced radiotracer dosage. Clinical relevance The proposed method would enhance the utility of PET scanning at lower radiotracer dosage and inform future workflows for brain lesion detection and Alzheimer's disease diagnosis, especially for those patients who need multiple examinations.

TITLE: Optimization of Reconstruction Parameters for Discovery 710 Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography

AUTHORS: Ahmed Abdel Mohymen, Hamed Ibrahim Farag, Sameh M Reda, Ahmed Soltan Monem, Said Abdelfattah Ali

JOURNAL: Journal of medical physics

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Aim: This study aimed to optimize the quantitative aspects of (18F) fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) imaging by investigating the impact of various reconstruction parameters on the recovery coefficients (RCs) using the NEMA image quality phantom. Specifically, the study aims to assess how different matrix sizes, iterations, subsets, and Gaussian postfilters affect the accuracy of standardized uptake value (SUV) quantification in (18F) FDG PET/CT imaging.

Materials and methods: The study utilized the "Vue Point FX + Sharp IR" algorithm for PET image reconstruction, incorporating 3D-ordered subset expectation maximization (3D-OSEM), time-of-flight, and point spread function technologies. Various reconstruction parameters were explored, including two distinct matrix sizes, multiple iterations, subsets, and a wide range of Gaussian postfilters. The investigation focused on the impact of these parameters on RCs using the NEMA image quality phantom.

Results: The results of the study indicated that for accurate SUV quantification in spheres ≥17 mm, the 256 × 256 matrix size and mean SUV should be employed. Conversely, for spheres ≤13 mm, maximum SUV was found to be more suitable. The choice of postfiltering value was shown to have a significant impact on SUV quantification accuracy, particularly for small-sized spheres. In addition, a larger matrix size was found to partially mitigate the effects of Gibbs artifact and slightly enhance SUV quantification for the spheres of various sizes.

Conclusion: This study highlights the critical importance of optimizing PET reconstruction parameters in accordance with the guidelines set by European Association of Nuclear Medicine/EARL. By optimizing these parameters, the accuracy and reliability of SUV quantification in (18F) FDG PET imaging can be significantly enhanced, especially for small-sized spheres. This underscores the necessity of carefully considering reconstruction parameters to ensure precise and reliable quantitative measurements in PET/CT imaging.

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear cardiology : official publication of the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Background: As clinical use of myocardial blood flow (MBF) increases, dynamic series are becoming part of the typical workflow. The methods and parameters used to reconstruct these series require investigation to ensure accurate quantification.

Methods: Fifty-nine rest/stress dynamic82Rb PET studies, acquired on a Biograph mCT, from a combination of normal volunteers and low-likelihood patients were reconstructed with and without time of flight (TOF) for varying iterations and processed to obtain relative perfusion and MBF polar maps. Regional values from mean polar maps were fit to a linear mixed-effect model to quantify convergence and select the optimal number of iterations.

Results: TOF reconstructions converged faster and yielded more uniform relative perfusion polar maps. However, the stress MBF distribution for TOF reconstructions was more heterogeneous, with a higher-intensity septal wall. This phenomenon requires further investigation, with right ventricle blood pool spillover possibly having an effect. Optimal reconstructions were defined as 5-iteration non-TOF (24-subset) reconstructions and 3-iteration TOF (21-subset) reconstructions.

Conclusion: Optimal cardiac reconstructions were identified for non-TOF and TOF reconstructions of dynamic series. TOF reconstruction presents as the more accurate method, given the more uniform relative perfusion distribution.

ABSTRACT:
The concept ofstructure engineeringhas been proposed for exploring the next generation of radiation detectors with improved performance. A TOF-PET geometry with heterostructured scintillators with a pixel size of 3.0 × 3.1 × 15 mm3was simulated using Monte Carlo. The heterostructures consisted of alternating layers of BGO as a dense material with high stopping power and plastic (EJ232) as a fast light emitter. The detector time resolution was calculated as a function of the deposited and shared energy in both materials on an event-by-event basis. While sensitivity was reduced to 32% for 100-μm thick plastic layers and 52% for 50μm, the coincidence time resolution (CTR) distribution improved to 204 ± 49 and 220 ± 41 ps, respectively, compared to 276 ps that we considered for bulk BGO. The complex distribution of timing resolutions was accounted for in the reconstruction. We divided the events into three groups based on their CTR and modeled them with different Gaussian TOF kernels. On an NEMA IQ phantom, the heterostructures had better contrast recovery in early iterations. On the other hand, BGO achieved a better contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) after the 15th iteration due to the higher sensitivity. The developed simulation and reconstruction methods constitute new tools for evaluating different detector designs with complex time responses.

AUTHORS: Gabriela Llosá, Magdalena Rafecas

JOURNAL: European physical journal plus

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Compton cameras can offer advantages over gamma cameras for some applications, since they are well suited for multitracer imaging and for imaging high-energy radiotracers, such as those employed in radionuclide therapy. While in conventional clinical settings state-of-the-art Compton cameras cannot compete with well-established methods such as PET and SPECT, there are specific scenarios in which they can constitute an advantageous alternative. The combination of PET and Compton imaging can benefit from the improved resolution and sensitivity of current PET technology and, at the same time, overcome PET limitations in the use of multiple radiotracers. Such a system can provide simultaneous assessment of different radiotracers under identical conditions and reduce errors associated with physical factors that can change between acquisitions. Advances are being made both in instrumentation developments combining PET and Compton cameras for multimodal or three-gamma imaging systems, and in image reconstruction, addressing the challenges imposed by the combination of the two modalities or the new techniques. This review article summarizes the advances made in Compton cameras for medical imaging and their combination with PET.

TITLE: Improving image reconstruction to quantify dynamic whole-body PET/CT: Q.Clear versus OSEM

AUTHORS: Sam Springer, Jeremy Basset-Sagarminaga, Tineke van de Weijer, Vera B Schrauwen-Hinderling, Walter H Backes, Roel Wierts

JOURNAL: EJNMMI physics

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Background: The introduction of PET systems featuring increased count rate sensitivity has resulted in the development of dynamic whole-body PET acquisition protocols to assess18F-FDG uptake rate () using18F-FDG PET/CT. However, in short-axis field-of-view (SAFOV) PET/CT systems, multiple bed positions are required per time frame to achieve whole-body coverage. This results in high noise levels, requiring higher18F-FDG activity administration and, consequently, increased patient radiation dose. Bayesian penalized-likelihood PET reconstruction (e.g. Q.Clear, GE Healthcare) has been shown to effectively suppress image noise compared to standard reconstruction techniques. This study investigated the impact of Bayesian penalized-likelihood reconstruction on dynamic whole-body18F-FDG PET quantification.

Methods: Dynamic whole-body18F-FDG PET/CT data (SAFOV PET Discovery MI 5R, GE Healthcare) of healthy volunteers and one lung cancer patient, consisting of a ten-minute dynamic scan of the thoracic region followed by six whole-body passes, were reconstructed with Q.Clear and Ordered Subset Expectation Maximization (OSEM) according to EARL 2 standards. Image noise in the measured time-activity-curves (TAC) was determined for the myocardium, hamstring, liver, subcutaneous adipose tissue and lung lesion for both reconstruction methods.values were calculated using Patlak analysis. Finally, bootstrapping was used to investigate the effect of image noise levels onvalues (bias and precision) as a function of magnitude ofand volume-of-interest (VOI) size for both computationally simulated TACs (= 1.0-50.0·10-3·ml·cm-3·min-1) and the measured TACs.

Results: Compared to OSEM, Q.Clear showed 40-55% lower noise levels for all tissue types (p < 0.05). For the measured TACs no systematic bias inwith either reconstruction method was observed.precision decreased with decreasing VOI size, with that of Q.Clear being superior compared to OSEM for small VOIs of 0.56 cm3in all tissues (p < 0.05), with the largest difference in relative precision for small values of. The simulated TACs corroborated these results, with Q.Clear providing the best precision for small values ofand small VOIs in all tissues.

Conclusion: Q.Clear reconstruction of dynamic whole-body PET/CT data yields more precisevalues, especially for small values ofand smaller VOIs, compared to standard OSEM. This precision improvement shows Q.Clear's potential to better detect and characterize small lesion metabolic activity in oncology and allows for lower administered activity dosage.

TITLE: Comparison of Regularized Reconstruction and Ordered Subset Expectation Maximization Reconstruction in the Diagnostics of Prostate Cancer Using Digital Time-of-Flight 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT Imaging

AUTHORS: Olof Jonmarker, Rimma Axelsson, Ted Nilsson, Stefan Gabrielson

JOURNAL: Diagnostics (Basel, Switzerland)

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
In prostate cancer, the early detection of distant spread has been shown to be of importance. Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-binding radionuclides in positron emission tomography (PET) is a promising method for precise disease staging. PET diagnostics depend on image reconstruction techniques, and ordered subset expectation maximization (OSEM) is the established standard. Block sequential regularized expectation maximization (BSREM) is a more recent reconstruction algorithm and may produce fewer equivocal findings and better lesion detection.

Methods: 68Ga PSMA-11 PET/CT scans of patients with de novo or suspected recurrent prostate cancer were retrospectively reformatted using both the OSEM and BSREM algorithms. The lesions were counted and categorized by three radiologists. The intra-class correlation (ICC) and Cohen's kappa for the inter-rater reliability were calculated.

Results: Sixty-one patients were reviewed. BSREM identified slightly fewer lesions overall and fewer equivocal findings. ICC was excellent with regards to definitive lymph nodes and bone metastasis identification and poor with regards to equivocal metastasis irrespective of the reconstruction algorithm. The median Cohen's kappa were 0.66, 0.74, 0.61 and 0.43 for OSEM and 0.61, 0.63, 0.66 and 0.53 for BSREM, with respect to the tumor, local lymph nodes, metastatic lymph nodes and bone metastasis detection, respectively.

Conclusions: BSREM in the setting of68Ga PMSA PET staging or restaging is comparable to OSEM.

JOURNAL: Machine learning in clinical neuroimaging :, 6th international workshop, MLCN 2023, held in conjunction with MICCAI 2023, Vancouver, BC, Canada, October 8, 2023, proceedings /. MLCN (Workshop) (6th : 2023 : Vancouver, B.C.)

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Head movement during long scan sessions degrades the quality of reconstruction in positron emission tomography (PET) and introduces artifacts, which limits clinical diagnosis and treatment. Recent deep learning-based motion correction work utilized raw PET list-mode data and hardware motion tracking (HMT) to learn head motion in a supervised manner. However, motion prediction results were not robust to testing subjects outside the training data domain. In this paper, we integrate a cross-attention mechanism into the supervised deep learning network to improve motion correction across test subjects. Specifically, cross-attention learns the spatial correspondence between the reference images and moving images to explicitly focus the model on the most correlative inherent information - the head region the motion correction. We validate our approach on brain PET data from two different scanners: HRRT without time of flight (ToF) and mCT with ToF. Compared with traditional and deep learning benchmarks, our network improved the performance of motion correction by 58% and 26% in translation and rotation, respectively, in multi-subject testing in HRRT studies. In mCT studies, our approach improved performance by 66% and 64% for translation and rotation, respectively. Our results demonstrate that cross-attention has the potential to improve the quality of brain PET image reconstruction without the dependence on HMT.

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Background Advances in three-dimensional reconstruction techniques and computational fluid dynamics of coronary CT angiography (CCTA) data sets make feasible evaluation of endothelial shear stress (ESS) in the vessel wall. Purpose To investigate the relationship between CCTA-derived computational fluid dynamics metrics, anatomic and morphologic characteristics of coronary lesions, and their comparative performance in predicting impaired coronary vasodilating capability assessed by using PET myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI). Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, conducted between October 2019 and September 2020, coronary vessels in patients with stable chest pain and with intermediate probability of coronary artery disease who underwent both CCTA and PET MPI with oxygen 15-labeled water or nitrogen 13 ammonia and quantification of myocardial blood flow were analyzed. CCTA images were used in assessing stenosis severity, lesion-specific total plaque volume (PV), noncalcified PV, calcified PV, and plaque phenotype. PET MPI was used in assessing significant coronary stenosis. The predictive performance of the CCTA-derived parameters was evaluated by using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) analysis. Results There were 92 coronary vessels evaluated in 53 patients (mean age, 65 years ± 7; 31 men). ESS was higher in lesions with greater than 50% stenosis versus those without significant stenosis (mean, 15.1 Pa ± 30 vs 4.6 Pa ± 4 vs 3.3 Pa ± 3;P= .004). ESS was higher in functionally significant versus nonsignificant lesions (median, 7 Pa [interquartile range, 5-23 Pa] vs 2.6 Pa [interquartile range, 1.8-5 Pa], respectively;P≤ .001). Adding ESS to stenosis severity improved prediction (change in AUC, 0.10; 95% CI: 0.04, 0.17;P= .002) for functionally significant lesions. Conclusion The combination of endothelial shear stress with coronary CT angiography (CCTA) stenosis severity improved prediction of an abnormal PET myocardial perfusion imaging result versus CCTA stenosis severity alone. © RSNA, 2021Online supplemental material is available for this article.See also the editorial by Kusmirek and Wieben in this issue.

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Fluorine-18 prostate-specific membrane antigen-1007 positron emission tomography/computed tomography (18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT) has been shown to be superior to multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the locoregional staging of intermediate-risk and high-risk prostate tumors. This study aims to evaluate whether it is also superior in estimating tumor parameters, such as three-dimensional spatial localization and volume.

Methods: 134 participants underwent18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT and MRI prior to radical prostatectomy as part of the validating paired-cohort Next Generation Trial (NCT05141760). MRI,18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT, and final pathology were independently assessed by blinded radiologists, nuclear medicine physicians, and pathologists, respectively. Individual tumor nodules were measured in three dimensions and cognitively registered to 38 segment prostate diagrams as per PI-RADSv2.1. Correct spatial localization was compared using McNemar test and estimation of tumor volumes were compared using linear regression and partial F-test.

Results: 286 tumor nodules were identified by final histopathology.18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT was superior to MRI for correct localization (186 [65.0%] vs 134 [46.9%], p < 0.001) and tumor volume estimation (R2= 0.545 vs 0.431, p < 0.001). Larger tumors and higher Gleason Grade Group (GGG) were associated with correct localization by18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT (OR = 2.05, p < 0.001 for tumor volume and OR = 4.92, p < 0.01 for ≥ GGG3) and MRI (OR = 1.81, p < 0.001 for tumor volume and OR = 11.67, p < 0.001 for ≥ GGG3).

Conclusion: 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT outperforms MRI for determination of three-dimensional spatial localization and volume of prostate tumors. These findings support the use of18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT prior to definitive treatment of localized prostate cancers.

TITLE: Improving the Timing Resolution of Positron Emission Tomography Detectors Using Boosted Learning-A Residual Physics Approach

AUTHORS: Stephan Naunheim, Yannick Kuhl, David Schug, Volkmar Schulz, Florian Mueller

JOURNAL: IEEE transactions on neural networks and learning systems

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Artificial intelligence (AI) is entering medical imaging, mainly enhancing image reconstruction. Nevertheless, improvements throughout the entire processing, from signal detection to computation, potentially offer significant benefits. This work presents a novel and versatile approach to detector optimization using machine learning (ML) and residual physics. We apply the concept to positron emission tomography (PET), intending to improve the coincidence time resolution (CTR). PET visualizes metabolic processes in the body by detecting photons with scintillation detectors. Improved CTR performance offers the advantage of reducing radioactive dose exposure for patients. Modern PET detectors with sophisticated concepts and read-out topologies represent complex physical and electronic systems requiring dedicated calibration techniques. Traditional methods primarily depend on analytical formulations successfully describing the main detector characteristics. However, when accounting for higher-order effects, additional complexities arise matching theoretical models to experimental reality. Our work addresses this challenge by combining traditional calibration with AI and residual physics, presenting a highly promising approach. We present a residual physics-based strategy using gradient tree boosting and physics-guided data generation. The explainable AI framework SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAPs) was used to identify known physical effects with learned patterns. In addition, the models were tested against basic physical laws. We were able to improve the CTR significantly (more than 20%) for clinically relevant detectors of 19 mm height, reaching CTRs of 185 ps (450-550 keV).

TITLE: Quantification of late gadolinium enhancement cardiovascular MRI in patients with coronary artery chronic total occlusion

AUTHORS: L J Zhang, W Dong, J N Li, H Z Mi, J Jiao, R Y Dou, J An, J L Liu, Y He, X T Song

JOURNAL: Clinical radiology

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Aim: To determine the most accurate and reproducible semi-automated greyscale thresholding technique for quantifying late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) in cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI), by using positron-emission tomography (PET) as the reference standard in patients with coronary artery chronic total occlusion (CTO).

Materials and methods: LGE in CMRI, single-photon-emission computed tomography (SPECT), and PET were performed within 1 week in each of 63 patients with known CTO. The presence and quantity of LGE were determined with greyscale thresholds of 2, 4, 5, 6, and 8 standard deviations (SDs) above the mean signal intensity for normal remote myocardium and full width at half maximum (FWHM). The infarcted myocardium was delineated by PET.

Results: Sixty-three patients and 1,008 segments were analysed. Based on patient analysis, with PET as the reference standard, the 5 SD method yielded the strongest correlation (r=0.85, p<0.0001) compared with the 2 SDs (r=0.42), 4 SDs (r=0.73), 6 SDs (r=0.81), 8 SDs (r=0.71), and FWHM (r=0.69; p<0.001 for all comparisons). The 5 SDs threshold quantification showed high interobserver and intra-observer agreement (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC]=0.90, p<0.0001; ICC=0.93, p<0.0001, respectively).

Conclusions: Semi-automated LGE CMRI greyscale thresholding with 5 SDs above the mean signal intensity for normal remote myocardium yields the strongest correlation to the extent of LGE identified using PET and is highly reproducible in patients with CTO.

JOURNAL: Asian journal of endoscopic surgery

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
A 38-year-old male patient with a history of right inguinal hernia surgery 18 years previously presented with epigastric pain. An examination revealed advanced gastric cancer. Abdominal CT demonstrated a 6-cm mass with well-defined borders and heterogeneous internal density in the pelvis to the right side of the bladder, and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) found marginal FDG accumulation in the periphery of the mass. Given the patient's history, a retained surgical sponge (RSS), known as gossypiboma, was suspected. Resection of the lesion was performed using 3D laparoscopy, which confirmed the mass to be gossypiboma. The use of 3D laparoscopy reduced the invasiveness of the procedure and clarified the tumor's relationship with the surrounding organs.

TITLE: The effect of Q.Clear reconstruction on quantification and spatial resolution of 18F-FDG PET in simultaneous PET/MR

AUTHORS: Defeng Tian, Hongwei Yang, Yan Li, Bixiao Cui, Jie Lu

JOURNAL: EJNMMI physics

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Background: Q.Clear is a block sequential regularized expectation maximization penalized-likelihood reconstruction algorithm for Positron Emission Tomography (PET). It has shown high potential in improving image reconstruction quality and quantification accuracy in PET/CT system. However, the evaluation of Q.Clear in PET/MR system, especially for clinical applications, is still rare. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of Q.Clear on the18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/MR system and to determine the optimal penalization factor β for clinical use.

Methods: A PET National Electrical Manufacturers Association/ International Electrotechnical Commission (NEMA/IEC) phantom was scanned on GE SIGNA PET/MR, based on NEMA NU 2-2012 standard. Metrics including contrast recovery (CR), background variability (BV), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and spatial resolution were evaluated for phantom data. For clinical data, lesion SNR, signal to background ratio (SBR), noise level and visual scores were evaluated. PET images reconstructed from OSEM + TOF and Q.Clear were visually compared and statistically analyzed, where OSEM + TOF adopted point spread function as default procedure, and Q.Clear used different β values of 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 800, 1100 and 1400.

Results: For phantom data, as β value increased, CR and BV of all sizes of spheres decreased in general; images reconstructed from Q.Clear reached the peak SNR with β value of 400 and generally had better resolution than those from OSEM + TOF. For clinical data, compared with OSEM + TOF, Q.Clear with β value of 400 achieved 138% increment in median SNR (from 58.8 to 166.0), 59% increment in median SBR (from 4.2 to 6.8) and 38% decrement in median noise level (from 0.14 to 0.09). Based on visual assessment from two physicians, Q.Clear with β values ranging from 200 to 400 consistently achieved higher scores than OSEM + TOF, where β value of 400 was considered optimal.

Conclusions: The present study indicated that, on18F-FDG PET/MR, Q.Clear reconstruction improved the image quality compared to OSEM + TOF. β value of 400 was optimal for Q.Clear reconstruction.

AUTHORS: Achraf Bahloul, Antoine Verger, Alain Blum, Mohammad Bilal Chawki, Mathieu Perrin, Saifeddine Melki, Gilles Karcher, Pierre-Yves Marie, Laetitia Imbert

JOURNAL: Frontiers in nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Objective:An image display with a standardized uptake value (SUV) scale is recommended for analyzing PET exams, thus requiring the reconstruction of accurate images for both SUV measurement and visual analysis. This study aimed to determine whether such images may also be obtained with a high-speed CZT-SPECT/CT system, with a further application for the longitudinal monitoring of vertebral fractures.Materials and Methods:SPECT image reconstruction was optimized with an IEC phantom according to both image quality parameters and accuracy of measured activity. The optimized reconstruction process was applied to ≤15 min99mTc-HDP SPECT spine recordings previously acquired from 25 patients (74 ± 12 years old) at both early (1.3 ± 1.1 months) and late (5.2 ± 2.3 months) stages after an acute vertebral fracture.Results:A SPECT reconstruction with 32 equivalent iterations was selected based on the association of high detectability for spheres down to 0.6 ml in volume, with accurate measured activity, although the latter was affected by partial volume effect for spheres ≤5.6 ml. Coherent measurements were obtained on these high-quality SPECT images for the SUVmax from the intact vertebrae of patients, which were stable between basal SPECT/CT and follow-up SPECT/CT (for T1 vertebrae: 5.7 ± 1.1 vs. 5.8 ± 1.1,p= 0.76), and from initially fractured vertebrae, which were dramatically higher on the basal compared with the follow-up SPECT (21.0 ± 8.5 vs. 11.2 ± 4.2,p< 0.001), whereas inverse changes in SUVmax were observed for newly compacted fractures identified on follow-up SPECT (74.4 ± 2.0 vs. 21.8 ± 10.3,p= 0.002). Finally, an image display with an SUV scale was shown to be advantageous for highlighting areas with >7.5 SUV, a level reached by 98% of vertebral fractures of <7 months and 4% of reference intact vertebrae.Conclusion:Bone scintigraphy of vertebral fractures may be obtained with this CZT-SPECT/CT system with fast 3D acquisitions and high-quality images displayed with a reliable SUV scale, approaching what is achieved and recommended for PET imaging.

TITLE: Identifying Musculoskeletal Pain Generators Using Clinical PET

AUTHORS: Daehyun Yoon, Feliks Kogan, Garry E Gold, Sandip Biswal

JOURNAL: Seminars in musculoskeletal radiology

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Identifying the source of a person's pain is a significant clinical challenge because the physical sensation of pain is believed to be subjective and difficult to quantify. The experience of pain is not only modulated by the individual's threshold to painful stimuli but also a product of the person's affective contributions, such as fear, anxiety, and previous experiences. Perhaps then to quantify pain is to examine the degree of nociception and pro-nociceptive inflammation, that is, the extent of cellular, chemical, and molecular changes that occur in pain-generating processes. Measuring changes in the local density of receptors, ion channels, mediators, and inflammatory/immune cells that are involved in the painful phenotype using targeted, highly sensitive, and specific positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracers is therefore a promising approach toward objectively identifying peripheral pain generators. Although several preclinical radiotracer candidates are being developed, a growing number of ongoingclinicalPET imaging approaches can measure the degree of target concentration and thus serve as a readout for sites of pain generation. Further, when PET is combined with the spatial and contrast resolution afforded by magnetic resonance imaging, nuclear medicine physicians and radiologists can potentially identify pain drivers with greater accuracy and confidence. Clinical PET imaging approaches with fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose, fluorine-18 sodium fluoride, and sigma-1 receptor PET radioligand and translocator protein radioligands to isolate the source of pain are described here.

TITLE: Multimodal Cross-Device and Marker-Free Co-Registration of Preclinical Imaging Modalities

AUTHORS: Mirko Thamm, Justin J Jeffery, Yapei Zhang, Bryan R Smith, Stephen Marchant, Fabian Kiessling, Felix Gremse

JOURNAL: Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Integrated preclinical multimodal imaging systems, such as X-ray computed tomography (CT) combined with positron emission tomography (PET) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) combined with PET, are widely available and typically provide robustly co-registered volumes. However, separate devices are often needed to combine a standalone MRI with an existing PET-CT or to incorporate additional data from optical tomography or high-resolution X-ray microtomography. This necessitates image co-registration, which involves complex aspects such as multimodal mouse bed design, fiducial marker inclusion, image reconstruction, and software-based image fusion. Fiducial markers often pose problems for in vivo data due to dynamic range issues, limitations on the imaging field of view, difficulties in marker placement, or marker signal loss over time (e.g., from drying or decay). These challenges must be understood and addressed by each research group requiring image co-registration, resulting in repeated efforts, as the relevant details are rarely described in existing publications. This protocol outlines a general workflow that overcomes these issues. Although a differential transformation is initially created using fiducial markers or visual structures, such markers are not required in production scans. The requirements for the volume data and the metadata generated by the reconstruction software are detailed. The discussion covers achieving and verifying requirements separately for each modality. A phantom-based approach is described to generate a differential transformation between the coordinate systems of two imaging modalities. This method showcases how to co-register production scans without fiducial markers. Each step is illustrated using available software, with recommendations for commercially available phantoms. The feasibility of this approach with different combinations of imaging modalities installed at various sites is showcased.

JOURNAL: Journal of imaging

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to have a major effect on radiology as it demonstrated remarkable progress in many clinical tasks, mostly regarding the detection, segmentation, classification, monitoring, and prediction of diseases. Generative Adversarial Networks have been proposed as one of the most exciting applications of deep learning in radiology. GANs are a new approach to deep learning that leverages adversarial learning to tackle a wide array of computer vision challenges. Brain radiology was one of the first fields where GANs found their application. In neuroradiology, indeed, GANs open unexplored scenarios, allowing new processes such as image-to-image and cross-modality synthesis, image reconstruction, image segmentation, image synthesis, data augmentation, disease progression models, and brain decoding. In this narrative review, we will provide an introduction to GANs in brain imaging, discussing the clinical potential of GANs, future clinical applications, as well as pitfalls that radiologists should be aware of.

TITLE: Theranostic SPECT reconstruction for improved resolution: application to radionuclide therapy dosimetry

AUTHORS: H Marquis, D Deidda, A Gillman, K P Willowson, Y Gholami, T Hioki, E Eslick, K Thielemans, D L Bailey

JOURNAL: EJNMMI physics

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Background: SPECT-derived dose estimates in tissues of diameter less than 3× system resolution are subject to significant losses due to the limited spatial resolution of the gamma camera. Incorporating resolution modelling (RM) into the SPECT reconstruction has been proposed as a possible solution; however, the images produced are prone to noise amplification and Gibbs artefacts. We propose a novel approach to SPECT reconstruction in a theranostic setting, which we term SPECTRE (single photon emission computed theranostic reconstruction); using a diagnostic PET image, with its superior resolution, to guide the SPECT reconstruction of the therapeutic equivalent. This report demonstrates a proof in principle of this approach.

Methods: We have employed the hybrid kernelised expectation maximisation (HKEM) algorithm implemented in STIR, with the aim of producing SPECT images with PET-equivalent resolution. We demonstrate its application in both a dual68Ga/177Lu IEC phantom study and a clinical example using64Cu/67Cu.

Results: SPECTRE is shown to produce images comparable in accuracy and recovery to PET with minimal introduction of artefacts and amplification of noise.

Conclusion: The SPECTRE approach to image reconstruction shows improved quantitative accuracy with a reduction in noise amplification. SPECTRE shows great promise as a method of improving SPECT radioactivity concentrations, directly leading to more accurate dosimetry estimates in small structures and target lesions. Further investigation and optimisation of the algorithm parameters is needed before this reconstruction method can be utilised in a clinical setting.

TITLE: Unsupervised deep learning framework for data-driven gating in positron emission tomography

AUTHORS: Tiantian Li, Zhaoheng Xie, Wenyuan Qi, Evren Asma, Jinyi Qi

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Background: Physiological motion, such as respiratory motion, has become a limiting factor in the spatial resolution of positron emission tomography (PET) imaging as the resolution of PET detectors continue to improve. Motion-induced misregistration between PET and CT images can also cause attenuation correction artifacts. Respiratory gating can be used to freeze the motion and to reduce motion induced artifacts.

Purpose: In this study, we propose a robust data-driven approach using an unsupervised deep clustering network that employs an autoencoder (AE) to extract latent features for respiratory gating.

Methods: We first divide list-mode PET data into short-time frames. The short-time frame images are reconstructed without attenuation, scatter, or randoms correction to avoid attenuation mismatch artifacts and to reduce image reconstruction time. The deep AE is then trained using reconstructed short-time frame images to extract latent features for respiratory gating. No additional data are required for the AE training. K-means clustering is subsequently used to perform respiratory gating based on the latent features extracted by the deep AE. The effectiveness of our proposed Deep Clustering method was evaluated using physical phantom and real patient datasets. The performance was compared against phase gating based on an external signal (External) and image based principal component analysis (PCA) with K-means clustering (Image PCA).

Results: The proposed method produced gated images with higher contrast and sharper myocardium boundaries than those obtained using the External gating method and Image PCA. Quantitatively, the gated images generated by the proposed Deep Clustering method showed larger center of mass (COM) displacement and higher lesion contrast than those obtained using the other two methods.

Conclusions: The effectiveness of our proposed method was validated using physical phantom and real patient data. The results showed our proposed framework could provide superior gating than the conventional External method and Image PCA.

JOURNAL: Clinical radiology

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Physiological and pathological processes arising from the breast and anterior chest wall may share similar clinical presentations because of the small volume of male breasts. Therefore, imaging is frequently required to localise and characterise the lesion and guide biopsy when radiological findings are equivocal or suspicious. Mammography or digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) and ultrasound are the mainstays of breast imaging work-up. Other imaging techniques such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron-emission tomography (PET) can sometimes augment the investigation and aid treatment planning. This article reviews the key imaging features of a wide spectrum of benign and malignant conditions that involve the male breast and anterior chest wall across various age groups. Familiarisation with the salient radiological findings is essential for reaching an accurate diagnosis and optimising management.

TITLE: Fast vs slow rubidium-82 infusion profiles and test-retest precision of myocardial perfusion using contemporary 3D cardiac analog positron emission tomography-computed tomography imaging

AUTHORS: Robert M Bober, Richard V Milani, Nadia I Abelhad, Cruz Velasco-Gonzalez, Merrill H Stewart, Daniel P Morin

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear cardiology : official publication of the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Background: On legacy 2D positron emission tomography (PET) systems utilizing a 50 mL/min Rb-82 profile, test-retest precision of quantitative perfusion is ∼10%. It is unclear whether Rb-82 infusion rate significantly impacts quantitative perfusion and/or image quality on modern analog 3D PET-CT systems. We aimed to determine whether the Rb-82 infusion profile significantly impacts test-retest precision of quantitative perfusion, perfusion metrics, and/or image quality on a modern analog 3D PET-CT scanner.

Methods: Ninety-eight volunteers from 3 distinct groups: healthy volunteers (Normals), patients with risk factors, and/or coronary disease (Clinicals) and patients with prior transmural myocardial infarctions (Infarcts), underwent cardiac stress testing on an analog 3D PET-CT. Participants received 3 consecutive resting scans and 2 consecutive stress scans, minutes apart, with two randomly assigned Rb-82 infusion profiles: 50 mL/min (fast [F]) and 20 mL/min (slow [S]). Perfusion metrics (resting (rMBF) and stress myocardial blood flow (sMBF)) were calculated using HeartSee software. Coefficients of variance (COV), repeatability (RC), MBF, and image quality metrics were compared.

Results: rMBF correlated well between F and S profiles, with intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) ranging .91-.93. sMBF was highly correlated between F and S profiles (ICC = .97). Fast and slow profiles were associated with similar same-day test-retest precision (COV 11.5% vs 11.3% (P = .77); RC 21.5% vs 22.6%, for F-F vs S-S). There were no clinically significant differences in MBF values between F and S profiles. Image quality metrics were similar between the 2 profiles.

Conclusions: There are no clinically significant differences in precision, perfusion metrics, or image quality between Rb-82 fast and slow infusions using a contemporary analog 3D PET-CT.

TITLE: Scalable Double Regularization for 3D Nano-CT Reconstruction

AUTHORS: Wei Tang, Meng Li

JOURNAL: Journal of petroleum science & engineering

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Nano-CT (computerized tomography) has emerged as a non-destructive high-resolution cross-sectional imaging technique to effectively study the sub-µm pore structure of shale, which is of fundamental importance to the evaluation and development of shale oil and gas. Nano-CT poses unique challenges to the inverse problem of reconstructing the 3D structure due to the lower signal-to-noise ratio (than Micro-CT) at the nano-scale, increased sensitivity to the misaligned geometry caused by the movement of object manipulator, limited sample size, and a larger volume of data at higher resolution. We propose a scalable double regularization (SDR) method to utilize the entire dataset for simultaneous 3D structural reconstruction across slices through total variation regularization within slices andL1regularization between adjacent slices. SDR allows information borrowing both within and between slices, contrasting with the traditional methods that usually build on slice by slice reconstruction. We develop a scalable and memory-efficient algorithm by exploiting the systematic sparsity and consistent geometry induced by such Nano-CT data. We illustrate the proposed method using synthetic data and two Nano-CT imaging datasets of Jiulaodong (JLD) shale and Longmaxi (LMX) shale acquired in the Sichuan Basin. These numerical experiments show that the proposed method substantially outperforms selected alternatives both visually and quantitatively.

TITLE: A new upper limit for effective dose in patient administered with 18F-FDG for PET/CT whole-body imaging with diagnostic CT parameters

AUTHORS: Parimalah Velo, Muhammad Irwan Ismail, Kala Krishnan Mohandas, Lingeswaran Kasilingam

JOURNAL: Journal of medical imaging and radiation sciences

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Introduction: The aim of present study is to estimate effective dose in patient undergoing18F-FDG for whole body PET/CT imaging with diagnostic CT parameters and identify the lowest achievable total effective dose.

Method: A total of 2247 PET/CT patients with normal glucose level underwent18F-FDG-whole body imaging procedures. The18F-FDG dose of 3.7MBq per kg of patient weight administered via intravenous infusion. For CT parameters, kilovoltage of 140keV and current of 40 mAs were used for all studies. All the acquired images collected retrospectively and the effective dose was calculated for each patient using algorithm adapted from ICRP Publication 106, modified for patient weight and patient blood volume. The estimated effective doses were evaluated for patients' body weight and BMI.

Results: The mean of total effective dose and standard deviation is approximately 15.08(4.52) mSv using ICRP algorithm. 56% of total patient has normal BMI and their average total effective dose is 13.6mSv. Underweight patients' effective dose can be as low as 9.6mSv even using diagnostic CT protocols.

Conclusion: The effective dose of PET/CT procedure in present study is one of the lowest although using diagnostic parameters for CT acquisition compared to published data worldwide. This is due to the improved sensitivity of PET and complex reconstruction technique that maintains the image quality. A significant association between body weight, BMI and effective dose is reported in present study. Therefore, it is suggested that attention must be given for underweight and ideal BMI patients while prescribing FDG activity and CT imaging parameters in order to minimize the effective dose. The effective dose reported in present study can be considered as an upper limit for effective dose in PET/CT patients with normal BMI. This upper limit can be treated as a standard limit when optimizing imaging parameters, developing algorithm for image reconstruction and prescribing activity for patients. This practice could fulfill ALARA principle that could reduce cancer risk.

TITLE: Impact of a deep progressive reconstruction algorithm on low-dose or fast-scan PET image quality and Deauville score in patients with lymphoma

AUTHORS: Wenli Qiao, Taisong Wang, Hongyuan Yi, Xuebing Li, Yang Lv, Chen Xi, Runze Wu, Ying Wang, Ye Yu, Yan Xing, Jinhua Zhao

JOURNAL: EJNMMI physics

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Background: A deep progressive learning method for PET image reconstruction named deep progressive reconstruction (DPR) method was developed and presented in previous works. It has been shown in previous study that the DPR with one-third duration can maintain the image quality as OSEM with standard dose (3.7 MBq/kg). Subsequent studies have shown we can reduce the administered activity of18F-FDG by up to 2/3 in a real-world deployment with DPR. The aim of this study is to assess the impact of the use of DPR on Deauville score (DS) and clinical interpretation of PET/CT in patients with lymphoma.

Methods: A total of 87 lymphoma patients (age, 45.1 ± 14.9 years) who underwent18F-FDG PET imaging for during or post-treatment follow-up from November 2020 to February 2024 were prospectively enrolled. The patients were randomly assigned to two groups, including the 1/3 standard dose group and the standard dose group. Forty-four patients were injected with 1/3 standard dose (1.23 MBq/kg) and scanned for 6 min per bed and were reconstructed: ordered-subsets expectation maximization (OSEM) with 6 min per bed (OSEM_6 min_1/3), OSEM_2 min_1/3 and DPR_2 min_1/3. Forty-three patients were scanned according to the standard protocol (3.7 MBq/kg) and were reconstructed: OSEM with 2 min per bed (OSEM_2 min_full), OSEM_40 s_full and DPR_40 s_full. Additionally, the conventional 5-point scale measurement analysis was performed and DS for lymphoma were determined in different groups. Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare the mean values of liver SUVmax and mediastinal blood pool (MBP) SUVmax in each group. Likert scale and DS were evaluated using Wilcoxon signed rank test.

Results: The patients with OSEM_6 min_1/3 and DPR_2 min_1/3 showed good image quality with 5(5,5) and 5(4,5) of Likert scoring, as well as the patients with OSEM_2 min_full and DPR_40 s_full. No significant difference was found between the OSEM_6 min_1/3 and DPR_2 min_1/3 groups in terms of liver SUVmax and MBP SUVmax (P = 0.452 and 0.430), as well as the patients with OSEM_2 min_full and DPR_40 s_full (P = 0.105 and 0.638). No significant difference was found between the OSEM_6 min_1/3 and DPR_2 min_1/3 groups in terms of lesion SUVmax (P = 0.080). There was a significant differences in lesion SUVmax between OSEM-2 min_full with DPR-40 s_full (P = 0.027). The DS results were consistent (100%) between OSEM-6 min_1/3 with DPR_2 min_1/3, and between OSEM-2 min_full with DPR-40 s_full, respectively.

Conclusions: DPR reconstruction demonstrated feasibility in reducing PET injection dose or scanning time, while ensuring the preservation of image quality and DS for during or post-treatment follow-up patients with lymphoma.

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear cardiology : official publication of the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Background: Coronary18F-sodium-fluoride (18F-NaF) positron emission tomography (PET) showed promise in imaging coronary artery disease activity. Currently image processing remains subjective due to the need for manual registration of PET and computed tomography (CT) angiography data. We aimed to develop a novel fully automated method to register coronary18F-NaF PET to CT angiography using pseudo-CT generated by generative adversarial networks (GAN).

Methods: A total of 169 patients, 139 in the training and 30 in the testing sets were considered for generation of pseudo-CT from non-attenuation corrected (NAC) PET using GAN. Non-rigid registration was used to register pseudo-CT to CT angiography and the resulting transformation was used to align PET with CT angiography. We compared translations, maximal standard uptake value (SUVmax) and target to background ratio (TBRmax) at the location of plaques, obtained after observer and automated alignment.

Results: Automatic end-to-end registration was performed for 30 patients with 88 coronary vessels and took 27.5 seconds per patient. Difference in displacement motion vectors between GAN-based and observer-based registration in the x-, y-, and z-directions was 0.8 ± 3.0, 0.7 ± 3.0, and 1.7 ± 3.9 mm, respectively. TBRmaxhad a coefficient of repeatability (CR) of 0.31, mean bias of 0.03 and narrow limits of agreement (LOA) (95% LOA: - 0.29 to 0.33). SUVmaxhad CR of 0.26, mean bias of 0 and narrow LOA (95% LOA: - 0.26 to 0.26).

Conclusion: Pseudo-CT generated by GAN are perfectly registered to PET can be used to facilitate quick and fully automated registration of PET and CT angiography.

TITLE: A novel method for harmonization of PET image spatial resolution without phantoms

AUTHORS: Felix Carbonell, Alex P Zijdenbos, Evan Hempel, Mihály Hajós, Barry J Bedell

JOURNAL: EJNMMI physics

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Background: Estimation of the spatial resolution in real images is extremely important in several fields, including crystallography, optics, microscopy, and tomography. In human PET imaging, estimating spatial resolution typically involves the acquisition of images from a physical phantom, typically a Hoffman phantom, which poses a logistical burden, especially in large multi-center studies. Indeed, phantom images may not always be readily available, and this method requires constant monitoring of scanner updates or replacements, scanning protocol changes, and image reconstruction guidelines to establish a equivalence with scans acquired from human subjects.

Methods: We propose a new computational approach that allows estimation of spatial resolution directly from human subject PET images. The proposed technique is based on the generalization of the logarithmic intensity plots in the 2D Fourier domain to the 3D case. The spatial resolution of the image is obtained through the estimated coefficients of a multiple linear regression problem having the logarithm of the squared norm of the Fourier transform as dependent variable and the squared 3D frequencies as multiple predictors.

Results: The proposed approach was applied to a cohort of subjects consisting of [18F]florbetapir amyloid PET images and matching phantoms from a Phase II clinical trial, and a second cohort including β-amyloid, FDG, and tau PET images from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study. The resulting in-plane and axial resolution estimators varied between 3.5 mm and 8.5 mm for both PET and matching phantom images. They also yielded less than one voxel size across-subjects variability in groups of images sharing the same PET scanner model and reconstruction parameters. For human PET images, we also proved that the spatial resolution estimators showed: (1) a very high reproducibility, as measured by intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC > 0.985), (2) a strong cross-tracer linear correlations, and (3) a high within-subject longitudinal consistency, as measured by the maximum difference value between pairs of visits from the same subject.

Conclusions: Our novel approach does not only eliminate the need for surrogate phantom data, but also provides a general framework that can be applied to a wide range of tracers and other imaging modalities, such as SPECT.

TITLE: A Robust Residual Three-dimensional Convolutional Neural Networks Model for Prediction of Amyloid-β Positivity by Using FDG-PET

AUTHORS: Ilya Ardakani, Takahiro Yamada, Sayaka Iwano, Sunil Kumar Maurya, Kazunari Ishii, Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative**

JOURNAL: Clinical nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Background: Widely used in oncology PET, 2-deoxy-2- 18 F-FDG PET is more accessible and affordable than amyloid PET, which is a crucial tool to determine amyloid positivity in diagnosis of Alzheimer disease (AD). This study aimed to leverage deep learning with residual 3D convolutional neural networks (3DCNN) to develop a robust model that predicts amyloid-β positivity by using FDG-PET.

Patients and methods: In this study, a cohort of 187 patients was used for model development. It consisted of patients ranging from cognitively normal to those with dementia and other cognitive impairments who underwent T1-weighted MRI, 18 F-FDG, and 11 C-Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) PET scans. A residual 3DCNN model was configured using nonexhaustive grid search and trained on repeated random splits of our development data set. We evaluated the performance of our model, and particularly its robustness, using a multisite data set of 99 patients of different ethnicities with images at different site harmonization levels.

Results: Our model achieved mean AUC scores of 0.815 and 0.840 on images without and with site harmonization correspondingly. Respectively, it achieved higher AUC scores of 0.801 and 0.834 in the cognitively normal (CN) group compared with 0.777 and 0.745 in the dementia group. As for F1 score, the corresponding mean scores were 0.770 and 0.810 on images without and with site harmonization. In the CN group, it achieved lower F1 scores of 0.580 and 0.658 compared with 0.907 and 0.931 in the dementia group.

Conclusions: We demonstrated that residual 3DCNN can learn complex 3D spatial patterns in FDG-PET images and robustly predict amyloid-β positivity with significantly less reliance on site harmonization preprocessing.

TITLE: Patterns of pathologic lymph nodes in anal cancer: a PET-CT-based analysis with implications for radiotherapy treatment volumes

AUTHORS: Anna Frennered, Jonas Scherman, Pamela Buchwald, Anders Johnsson, Hanna Sartor, Sophia Zackrisson, Elin Trägårdh, Martin P Nilsson

JOURNAL: BMC cancer

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Background: This study investigates the patterns of PET-positive lymph nodes (LNs) in anal cancer. The aim was to provide information that could inform future anal cancer radiotherapy contouring guidelines.

Methods: The baseline [18F]-FDG PET-CTs of 190 consecutive anal cancer patients were retrospectively assessed. LNs with a Deauville score (DS) of ≥3 were defined as PET-positive. Each PET-positive LN was allocated to a LN region and a LN sub-region; they were then mapped on a standard anatomy reference CT. The association between primary tumor localization and PET-positive LNs in different regions were analyzed.

Results: PET-positive LNs (n = 412) were identified in 103 of 190 patients (54%). Compared to anal canal tumors with extension into the rectum, anal canal tumors with perianal extension more often had inguinal (P < 0.001) and less often perirectal (P < 0.001) and internal iliac (P < 0.001) PET-positive LNs. Forty-two patients had PET-positive LNs confined to a solitary region, corresponding to first echelon nodes. The most common solitary LN region was inguinal (25 of 42; 60%) followed by perirectal (26%), internal iliac (10%), and external iliac (2%). No PET-positive LNs were identified in the ischiorectal fossa or in the inguinal area located posterolateral to deep vessels. Skip metastases above the bottom of the sacroiliac joint were quite rare. Most external iliac PET-positive LNs were located posterior to the external iliac vein; only one was located in the lateral external iliac sub-region.

Conclusions: The results support some specific modifications to the elective clinical target volume (CTV) in anal cancer. These changes would lead to reduced volumes of normal tissue being irradiated, which could contribute to a reduction in radiation side-effects.

AUTHORS: Luca Filippi, Angelo Iannarelli, Cesare Ambrogi, Oreste Bagni

JOURNAL: Clinical nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
We describe the case of a 54-year-old woman, previously submitted to nephrectomy for sarcomatoid renal cell carcinoma and treated with antibiotics because of central venous catheter infection. An F-FDG PET/CT scan was obtained that demonstrated bone and lymph node metastases and also disclosed an irregular area of highly increased uptake (SUVmax 19.4) in the right atrium. Clinical data did not suggest a relapsed infection. A contrast-enhanced CT examination of the heart enabled the diagnosis of intra-atrial metastasis. Furthermore, integration between PET and cardiac 3-dimensional volume rendering proved useful for defining the anatomical relationships between atrial metastasis and large vessels.

JOURNAL: Bioengineering (Basel, Switzerland)

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. Positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance (PET/MR) imaging is a promising technique that combines the advantages of PET and MR to provide both functional and structural information of the brain. Deep learning (DL) is a subfield of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on developing algorithms and models inspired by the structure and function of the human brain's neural networks. DL has been applied to various aspects of PET/MR imaging in AD, such as image segmentation, image reconstruction, diagnosis and prediction, and visualization of pathological features. In this review, we introduce the basic concepts and types of DL algorithms, such as feed forward neural networks, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and autoencoders. We then summarize the current applications and challenges of DL in PET/MR imaging in AD, and discuss the future directions and opportunities for automated diagnosis, predictions of models, and personalized medicine. We conclude that DL has great potential to improve the quality and efficiency of PET/MR imaging in AD, and to provide new insights into the pathophysiology and treatment of this devastating disease.

ABSTRACT:
This article is the second part in our machine learning series. Part 1 provided a general overview of machine learning in nuclear medicine. Part 2 focuses on neural networks. We start with an example illustrating how neural networks work and a discussion of potential applications. Recognizing that there is a spectrum of applications, we focus on recent publications in the areas of image reconstruction, low-dose PET, disease detection, and models used for diagnosis and outcome prediction. Finally, since the way machine learning algorithms are reported in the literature is extremely variable, we conclude with a call to arms regarding the need for standardized reporting of design and outcome metrics and we propose a basic checklist our community might follow going forward.

TITLE: Lutetium background radiation in total-body PET-A simulation study on opportunities and challenges in PET attenuation correction

AUTHORS: Negar Omidvari, Li Cheng, Edwin K Leung, Yasser G Abdelhafez, Ramsey D Badawi, Tianyu Ma, Jinyi Qi, Simon R Cherry

JOURNAL: Frontiers in nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
The current generation of total-body positron emission tomography (PET) scanners offer significant sensitivity increase with an extended axial imaging extent. With the large volume of lutetium-based scintillation crystals that are used as detector elements in these scanners, there is an increased flux of background radiation originating from176Lu decay in the crystals and higher sensitivity for detecting it. Combined with the ability of scanning the entire body in a single bed position, this allows more effective utilization of the lutetium background as a transmission source for estimating 511 keV attenuation coefficients. In this study, utilization of the lutetium background radiation for attenuation correction in total-body PET was studied using Monte Carlo simulations of a 3D whole-body XCAT phantom in the uEXPLORER PET scanner, with particular focus on ultralow-dose PET scans that are now made possible with these scanners. Effects of an increased acceptance angle, reduced scan durations, and Compton scattering on PET quantification were studied. Furthermore, quantification accuracy of lutetium-based attenuation correction was compared for a 20-min scan of the whole body on the uEXPLORER, a one-meter-long, and a conventional 24-cm-long scanner. Quantification and lesion contrast were minimally affected in both long axial field-of-view scanners and in a whole-body 20-min scan, the mean bias in all analyzed organs of interest were within a ±10% range compared to ground-truth activity maps. Quantification was affected in certain organs, when scan duration was reduced to 5 min or a reduced acceptance angle of 17° was used. Analysis of the Compton scattered events suggests that implementing a scatter correction method for the transmission data will be required, and increasing the energy threshold from 250 keV to 290 keV can reduce the computational costs and data rates, with negligible effects on PET quantification. Finally, the current results can serve as groundwork for transferring lutetium-based attenuation correction into research and clinical practice.

TITLE: MCGPU-PET: An Open-Source Real-Time Monte Carlo PET Simulator

AUTHORS: Joaquin L Herraiz, Alejandro Lopez-Montes, Andreu Badal

JOURNAL: Computer physics communications

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Monte Carlo (MC) simulations are commonly used to model the emission, transmission, and/or detection of radiation in Positron Emission Tomography (PET). In this work, we introduce a new open-source MC software for PET simulation, MCGPU-PET, which has been designed to fully exploit the computing capabilities of modern GPUs to simulate the acquisition of more than 100 million coincidences per second from voxelized sources and material distributions. The new simulator is an extension of the PENELOPE-based MCGPU code previously used in cone-beam CT and mammography applications. We validated the accuracy of the accelerated code by comparing it to GATE and PeneloPET simulations achieving an agreement within 10 percent approximately. As an example application of the code for fast estimation of PET coincidences, a scan of the NEMA IQ phantom was simulated. A fully 3D sinogram with 6382 million true coincidences and 731 million scatter coincidences was generated in 54 seconds in one GPU. MCGPU-PET provides an estimation of true and scatter coincidences and spurious background (for positron-gamma emitters such as124I) at a rate 3 orders of magnitude faster than CPU-based MC simulators. This significant speed-up enables the use of the code for accurate scatter and prompt-gamma background estimations within an iterative image reconstruction process.

JOURNAL: Frontiers in oncology

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Introduction: A newly developed clinical organ-targeted Positron Emission Tomography (PET) system (also known as Radialis PET) is tested with a set of standardized and custom tests previously used to evaluate the performance of Positron Emission Mammography (PEM) systems.

Methods: Imaging characteristics impacting standardized uptake value (SUV) and detectability of small lesions, namely spatial resolution, linearity, uniformity, and recovery coefficients, are evaluated.

Results: In-plane spatial resolution was measured as 2.3 mm ± 0.1 mm, spatial accuracy was 0.1 mm, and uniformity measured with flood field and NEMA NU-4 phantom was 11.7% and 8.3% respectively. Selected clinical images are provided as reference to the imaging capabilities under different clinical conditions such as reduced activity of 2-[fluorine-18]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (18F-FDG) and time-delayed acquisitions. SUV measurements were performed for selected clinical acquisitions to demonstrate a capability for quantitative image assessment of different types of cancer including for invasive lobular carcinoma with comparatively low metabolic activity. Quantitative imaging performance assessment with phantoms demonstrates improved contrast recovery and spill-over ratio for this PET technology when compared to other commercial organ-dedicated PET systems with similar spatial resolution. Recovery coefficients were measured to be 0.21 for the 1 mm hot rod and up to 0.89 for the 5 mm hot rod of NEMA NU-4 Image Quality phantom.

Discussion: Demonstrated ability to accurately reconstruct activity in tumors as small as 5 mm suggests that the Radialis PET technology may be well suited for emerging clinical applications such as image guided assessment of response to neoadjuvant systemic treatment (NST) in lesions smaller than 2 cm. Also, our results suggest that, while spatial resolution greatly influences the partial volume effect which degrades contrast recovery, optimized count rate performance and image reconstruction workflow may improve recovery coefficients for systems with comparable spatial resolution. We emphasize that recovery coefficient should be considered as a primary performance metric when a PET system is used for accurate lesion size or radiotracer uptake assessments.

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear medicine technology

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Sensitive detection of small metastatic lesions, which is highly dependent on lesion visualization, is crucial for staging lung cancer. We investigated the potential benefit of HYPER Iterative for improving the visualization of small metastatic lesions of lung cancer on early18F-labeled fibroblast activation protein inhibitor (FAPI) PET/CT.Methods:A total of 19 patients with lung cancer underwent a 60-min [18F]F-FAPI-42 dynamic total-body uEXPLORER PET/CT scan. PET images with a 5-min acquisition time were extracted at 10, 30 min, and 60 min after tracer injection. Ordered-subset expectation maximization (OSEM) and HYPER Iterative were used for image reconstruction. SUVmax, tumor-to-liver ratio, tumor-to-blood ratio, and tumor-to-adjacent-nontumor ratio were calculated and compared between the 2 reconstruction methods and at 10, 30, and 60 min after injection.Results:All HYPER and OSEM PET images were of high quality, with HYPER PET images showing superior clarity. Small positive lesions (maximum diameter, ≤1 cm) were depicted clearer on HYPER PET than on OSEM PET images at all time points, particularly at 10 min after injection, where 16.4% of lesions were poorly visualized on OSEM PET but clearly depicted on HYPER PET images. The tumor-to-liver ratio, tumor-to-blood ratio, and tumor-to-nontumor ratio at 10, 30, and 60 min after injection scan on HYPER PET images were significantly higher than those on OSEM images at corresponding time points (P≥ 0.05 for all comparisons). SUVmaxwas more than 2-fold greater in large positive lesions (maximum diameter, >1.0 cm) than in small positive lesions (maximum diameter, ≤1 cm) on both OSEM and HYPER PET images at 10, 30, and 60 min after injection (P< 0.05 for all comparisons). The visualization of large positive lesions was not significantly affected by reconstruction methods or scan times.Conclusion:HYPER Iterative reconstruction enhanced the visualization of small metastatic lesions in lung cancer when compared with conventional OSEM, enabling effective early imaging using [18F]F-FAPI-42 uEXPLORER total-body PET/CT at 10 min after tracer injection.

TITLE: Precision Nuclear Medicine: The Evolving Role of PET in Melanoma

AUTHORS: Chadwick L Wright, Eric D Miller, Carlo Contreras, Michael V Knopp

JOURNAL: Radiologic clinics of North America

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
The clinical management of melanoma patients has been rapidly evolving with the introduction of new targeted immuno-oncology (IO) therapeutics. The current diagnostic paradigms for melanoma patients begins with the histopathologic confirmation of melanoma, initial staging of disease burden with imaging and surgical approaches, treatment monitoring during systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy or IO therapeutics, restaging after completion of adjuvant systemic, surgical, and/or external radiation therapy, and the detection of recurrent malignancy/metastatic disease following therapy. New and evolving imaging approaches with positron-emission tomography (PET) imaging technologies, imaging methodologies, image reconstruction, and image analytics will likely continue to improve tumor detection, tumor characterization, and diagnostic confidence, enabling novel precision nuclear medicine practices for managing melanoma patients. This review will examine current concepts and challenges with existing PET imaging diagnostics for melanoma patients and introduce exciting new opportunities for PET in the current era of IO therapeutics.

TITLE: Restoration of amyloid PET images obtained with short-time data using a generative adversarial networks framework

AUTHORS: Young Jin Jeong, Hyoung Suk Park, Ji Eun Jeong, Hyun Jin Yoon, Kiwan Jeon, Kook Cho, Do-Young Kang

JOURNAL: Scientific reports

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Our purpose in this study is to evaluate the clinical feasibility of deep-learning techniques for F-18 florbetaben (FBB) positron emission tomography (PET) image reconstruction using data acquired in a short time. We reconstructed raw FBB PET data of 294 patients acquired for 20 and 2 min into standard-time scanning PET (PET20m) and short-time scanning PET (PET2m) images. We generated a standard-time scanning PET-like image (sPET20m) from a PET2mimage using a deep-learning network. We did qualitative and quantitative analyses to assess whether the sPET20mimages were available for clinical applications. In our internal validation, sPET20mimages showed substantial improvement on all quality metrics compared with the PET2mimages. There was a small mean difference between the standardized uptake value ratios of sPET20mand PET20mimages. A Turing test showed that the physician could not distinguish well between generated PET images and real PET images. Three nuclear medicine physicians could interpret the generated PET image and showed high accuracy and agreement. We obtained similar quantitative results by means of temporal and external validations. We can generate interpretable PET images from low-quality PET images because of the short scanning time using deep-learning techniques. Although more clinical validation is needed, we confirmed the possibility that short-scanning protocols with a deep-learning technique can be used for clinical applications.

TITLE: Optimization of SPECT/CT imaging protocols for quantitative and qualitative 99mTc SPECT

AUTHORS: Dennis Kupitz, Heiko Wissel, Jan Wuestemann, Stephanie Bluemel, Maciej Pech, Holger Amthauer, Michael C Kreissl, Oliver S Grosser

JOURNAL: EJNMMI physics

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Background: The introduction of hybrid SPECT/CT devices enables quantitative imaging in SPECT, providing a methodological setup for quantitation using SPECT tracers comparable to PET/CT. We evaluated a specific quantitative reconstruction algorithm for SPECT data using a99mTc-filled NEMA phantom. Quantitative and qualitative image parameters were evaluated for different parametrizations of the acquisition and reconstruction protocol to identify an optimized quantitative protocol.

Results: The reconstructed activity concentration (ACrec) and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of all examined protocols (n = 16) were significantly affected by the parametrization of the weighting factor k used in scatter correction, the total number of iterations and the sphere volume (all, p < 0.0001). The two examined SPECT acquisition protocols (with 60 or 120 projections) had a minor impact on the ACrecand no significant impact on the SNR. In comparison to the known AC, the use of default scatter correction (k = 0.47) or object-specific scatter correction (k = 0.18) resulted in an underestimation of ACrecin the largest sphere volume (26.5 ml) by - 13.9 kBq/ml (- 16.3%) and - 7.1 kBq/ml (- 8.4%), respectively. An increase in total iterations leads to an increase in estimated AC and a decrease in SNR. The mean difference between ACrecand known AC decreased with an increasing number of total iterations (e.g., for 20 iterations (2 iterations/10 subsets) = - 14.6 kBq/ml (- 17.1%), 240 iterations (24i/10s) = - 8.0 kBq/ml (- 9.4%), p < 0.0001). In parallel, the mean SNR decreased significantly from 2i/10s to 24i/10s by 76% (p < 0.0001).

Conclusion: Quantitative SPECT imaging is feasible with the used reconstruction algorithm and hybrid SPECT/CT, and its consistent implementation in diagnostics may provide perspectives for quantification in routine clinical practice (e.g., assessment of bone metabolism). When combining quantitative analysis and diagnostic imaging, we recommend using two different reconstruction protocols with task-specific optimized setups (quantitative vs. qualitative reconstruction). Furthermore, individual scatter correction significantly improves both quantitative and qualitative results.

TITLE: Inter-scanner Aβ-PET harmonization using barrel phantom spatial resolution matching

AUTHORS: Gihan P Ruwanpathirana, Robert C Williams, Colin L Masters, Christopher C Rowe, Leigh A Johnston, Catherine E Davey

JOURNAL: Alzheimer's & dementia (Amsterdam, Netherlands)

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Introduction: The standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) is used to measure amyloid beta-positron emission tomography (Aβ-PET) uptake in the brainDifferences in PET scanner technologies and image reconstruction techniques can lead to variability in PET images across scanners. This poses a challenge for Aβ-PET studies conducted in multiple centers. The aim of harmonization is to achieve consistent Aβ-PET measurements across different scanners. In this study, we propose an Aβ-PET harmonization method of matching spatial resolution, as measured via a barrel phantom, across PET scanners. Our approach was validated using paired subject data, for which patients were imaged on multiple scanners.

Methods: In this study, three different PET scanners were evaluated: the Siemens Biograph Vision 600, Siemens Biograph molecular computed tomography (mCT), and Philips Gemini TF64. A total of five, eight, and five subjects were each scanned twice with [18F]-NAV4694 across Vision-mCT, mCT-Philips, and Vision-Philips scanner pairs. The Vision and mCT scans were reconstructed using various iterations, subsets, and post-reconstruction Gaussian smoothing, whereas only one reconstruction configuration was used for the Philips scans. The full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of each reconstruction configuration was calculated using [18F]-filled barrel phantom scans with the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (SNMMI) phantom analysis toolkit. Regional SUVRs were calculated from 72 brain regions using the automated anatomical labelling atlas 3 (AAL3) atlas for each subject and reconstruction configuration. Statistical similarity between SUVRs was assessed using paired (within subject)t-tests for each pair of reconstructions across scanners; the higher thep-value, the greater the similarity between the SUVRs.

Results: Vision-mCT harmonization: Vision reconstruction with FWHM = 4.10 mm and mCT reconstruction with FWHM = 4.30 mm gave the maximal statistical similarity (maximump-value) between regional SUVRs.Philips-mCT harmonization: The FWHM of the Philips reconstruction was 8.2 mm and the mCT reconstruction with the FWHM of 9.35 mm, which gave the maximal statistical similarity between regional SUVRs.Philips-Vision harmonization: The Vision reconstruction with an FWHM of 9.1 mm gave the maximal statistical similarity between regional SUVRs when compared with the Philips reconstruction of 8.2 mm and were selected as the harmonized for each scanner pair.

Conclusion: Based on data obtained from three sets of participants, each scanned on a pair of PET scanners, it has been verified that using reconstruction configurations that produce matched-barrel, phantom spatial resolutions results in maximally harmonized Aβ-PET quantitation between scanner pairs. This finding is encouraging for the use of PET scanners in multi-center trials or updates during longitudinal studies.

Highlights: Question: Does the process of matching the barrel phantom-derived spatial resolution between scanners harmonize amyloid beta-standardized uptake value ratio (Aβ-SUVR) quantitation?Pertinent findings: It has been validated that reconstruction pairs with matched barrel phantom-derived spatial resolution maximize the similarity between subjects paired Aβ-PET (positron emission tomography) SUVR values recorded on two scanners.Implications for patient care: Harmonization between scanners in multi-center trials and PET camera updates in longitudinal studies can be achieved using a simple and efficient phantom measurement procedure, beneficial for the validity of Aβ-PET quantitation measurements.

ABSTRACT:
Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) monitoring and risk of rupture is currently assumed to be correlated with the aneurysm diameter. Aneurysm growth, however, has been demonstrated to be unpredictable. Using PET to measure uptake of [18F]-NaF in calcified lesions of the abdominal aorta has been shown to be useful for identifying AAA and to predict its growth. The PET low spatial resolution, however, can affect the accuracy of the diagnosis. Advanced edge-preserving reconstruction algorithms can overcome this issue. The kernel method has been demonstrated to provide noise suppression while retaining emission and edge information. Nevertheless, these findings were obtained using simulations, phantoms and a limited amount of patient data. In this study, the authors aim to investigate the usefulness of the anatomically guided kernelized expectation maximization (KEM) and the hybrid KEM (HKEM) methods and to judge the statistical significance of the related improvements. Sixty-one datasets of patients with AAA and 11 from control patients were reconstructed with ordered subsets expectation maximization (OSEM), HKEM and KEM and the analysis was carried out using the target-to-blood-pool ratio, and a series of statistical tests. The results show that all algorithms have similar diagnostic power, but HKEM and KEM can significantly recover uptake of lesions and improve the accuracy of the diagnosis by up to 22% compared to OSEM. The same improvements are likely to be obtained in clinical applications based on the quantification of small lesions, like for example cancer. This article is part of the theme issue 'Synergistic tomographic image reconstruction: part 1'.

TITLE: Fabrication of Double Emission Enhancement Fluorescent Nanoparticles with Combined PET and AIEE Effects

AUTHORS: Hsing-Ju Wu, Cheng-Chung Chang

JOURNAL: Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
The major challenge in the fabrication of fluorescent silica nanoparticles (FSNs) based on dye-doped silica nanoparticles (DDSNs) is aggregation-caused fluorescence quenching. Here, we constructed an FSN based on a double emission enhancement (DEE) platform. A thio-reactive fluorescence turn-on molecule,N-butyl-4-(4-maleimidostyryl)-1,8-naphthalimide (CS), was bound to a silane coupling agent, (3-mercaptopropyl)-trimethoxysilane (MPTMS), and the productN-butyl-4-(3-(trimethoxysilyl-propylthio)styryl)-1,8-naphthalimide (CSP) was further used to fabricate a core-shell nanoparticle through the Stöber method. We concluded that the turn-on emission by CSP originated from the photoinduced electron transfer (PET) between the maleimide moiety and the CSP core scaffold, and the second emission enhancement was attributed to the aggregation-induced emission enhancement (AIEE) in CSP when encapsulated inside a core-shell nanoparticle. Thus, FSNs could be obtained through DEE based on a combination of PET and AIEE effects. Systematic investigations verified that the resulting FSNs showed the traditional solvent-independent and photostable optical properties. The results implied that the novel FSNs are suitable as biomarkers in living cells and function as fluorescent visualizing agents for intracellular imaging and drug carriers.

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Background: We explored agreement in the quantification of myocardial perfusion by cross-comparison of implemented software packages (SPs) in three distinguishable patient profile populations.

Methods: We studied 91 scans of patients divided into 3 subgroups based on their semi-quantitative perfusion findings: patients with normal perfusion, with reversible perfusion defects, and with fixed perfusion defects. Rest myocardial blood flow (MBF), stress MBF, and myocardial flow reserve (MFR) were obtained with QPET, SyngoMBF, and Carimas. Agreement between SPs was considered adequate when a pairwise standardized difference was found to be < 0.20 and its corresponding intraclass correlation coefficient was ≥ 0.75.

Results: In patients with normal perfusion, two out of three comparisons of global stress MBF quantifications were outside the limits of agreement. In ischemic patients, all comparisons of global stress MBF and MFR were outside the limits of established agreement. In patients with fixed perfusion defects, all SP comparisons of perfusion quantifications were within the limit of agreement. Regionally, agreement of these perfusion estimates was mostly found for the left anterior descending artery vascular territory.

Conclusion: Reversible defects demonstrated the worst agreement in global stress MBF and MFR and discrepancies showed to be regional dependent. Reproducibility between SPs should not be assumed.

TITLE: Whole-Body Parametric Imaging of 18F-FDG PET Using uEXPLORER with Reduced Scanning Time

AUTHORS: Yaping Wu, Tao Feng, Yizhang Zhao, Tianyi Xu, Fangfang Fu, Zhun Huang, Nan Meng, Hongdi Li, Fengmin Shao, Meiyun Wang

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Parametric imaging of the net influx rate () in18F-FDG PET has been shown to provide improved quantification and specificity for cancer detection compared with SUV imaging. Current methods of generating parametric images usually require a long dynamic scanning time. With the recently developed uEXPLORER scanner, a dramatic increase in sensitivity has reduced the noise in dynamic imaging, making it more robust to use a nonlinear estimation method and flexible protocols. In this work, we explored 2 new possible protocols besides the standard 60-min one for the possibility of reducing scanning time forimaging.Methods:The gold standard protocol (protocol 1) was conventional dynamic scanning with a 60-min scanning time. The first proposed protocol (protocol 2) included 2 scanning periods: 0-4 min and 54-60 min after injection. The second proposed protocol (protocol 3) consisted of a single scanning period from 50 to 60 min after injection, with a second injection applied at 56 min. The 2 new protocols were simulated from the 60-min standard scans. A hybrid input function combining the population-based input function and the image-derived input function (IDIF) was used. The results were also compared with the IDIF acquired from protocol 1. A previously developed maximum-likelihood approach was used to estimate theimages. In total, 7 cancer patients imaged using the uEXPLORER scanner were enrolled in this study. Lesions were identified from the patient data, and the lesionvalues were compared among the different protocols.Results:The acquired hybrid input function was comparable in shape to the IDIF for each patient. The average difference in area under the curve was about 3%, suggesting good quantitative accuracy. The visual difference between theimages generated using IDIF and those generated using the hybrid input function was also minimal. The acquiredimages using different protocols were visually comparable. The averagedifference in the lesions was 2.8% ± 2.1% for protocol 2 and 1% ± 2.2% for protocol 3.Conclusion:The results suggest that it is possible to acquireimages using the nonlinear estimation approach with a much-reduced scanning time. Between the 2 new protocols, the protocol with dual injection shows the greatest promise in terms of practicality.

TITLE: A simulation study of the system characteristics for a long axial FOV PET design based on monolithic BGO flat panels compared with a pixelated LSO cylindrical design

AUTHORS: Meysam Dadgar, Jens Maebe, Maya Abi Akl, Boris Vervenne, Stefaan Vandenberghe

JOURNAL: EJNMMI physics

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Background: Although a new generation of tomographs with a longer axial field-of-view called total-body PET have been developed, they are not widely utilized due to their high cost compared to conventional scanners. The newly designed walk-through total-body PET scanner is introduced as a high-throughput and cost-efficient alternative to total-body PET scanners, by making use of a flat panel geometry and lower cost, depth-of-interaction capable, monolithic BGO detectors. The main aim of the presented study is to evaluate through Monte Carlo simulation the system characteristics of the walk-through total-body PET scanner by comparing it with a Quadra-like total-body PET of similar attributes to the Siemens Biograph Vision Quadra.

Methods: The walk-through total-body PET is comprised of two flat detector panels, spaced 50 cm apart. Each panel, 70 [Formula: see text] 106 cm[Formula: see text] in size, consists of 280 BGO-based monolithic detectors. The Quadra-like TB-PET has been simulated based on the characteristics of the Biograph Vision Quadra, one of the most common total-body PET scanners with 106 cm of axial field-of-view, which is constructed with pixelated LSO scintillation crystals. The spatial resolution, sensitivity, count rate performance, scatter fractions, and image quality of both scanners are simulated in the GATE simulation toolkit for comparison.

Results: Due to the DOI-capable detectors used in the walk-through total-body PET, the values of the spatial resolution of this scanner were all below 2 mm along directions parallel to the panels, and reached a maximum of 3.36 mm in the direction perpendicular to the panels. This resolution is a large improvement compared to the values of the Quadra-like TB-PET. The walk-through total-body PET uses its maximum sensitivity (154 cps/kBq) for data acquisition and image reconstruction.

Conclusion: Based on the combination of very good spatial resolution and high sensitivity of the walk-through total-body PET, along with a 2.2 times lower scintillation crystal volume and 1.8 times lower SiPM surface, this scanner can be a very cost-efficient alternative for total-body PET scanners in cases where concomitant CT is not required.

TITLE: Impact of γ factor in the penalty function of Bayesian penalized likelihood reconstruction (Q.Clear) to achieve high-resolution PET images

AUTHORS: Kenta Miwa, Tokiya Yoshii, Kei Wagatsuma, Shogo Nezu, Yuto Kamitaka, Tensho Yamao, Rinya Kobayashi, Shohei Fukuda, Yu Yakushiji, Noriaki Miyaji, Kenji Ishii

JOURNAL: EJNMMI physics

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Background: The Bayesian penalized likelihood PET reconstruction (BPL) algorithm, Q.Clear (GE Healthcare), has recently been clinically applied to clinical image reconstruction. The BPL includes a relative difference penalty (RDP) as a penalty function. The β value that controls the behavior of RDP determines the global strength of noise suppression, whereas the γ factor in RDP controls the degree of edge preservation. The present study aimed to assess the effects of various γ factors in RDP on the ability to detect sub-centimeter lesions.

Methods: All PET data were acquired for 10 min using a Discovery MI PET/CT system (GE Healthcare). We used a NEMA IEC body phantom containing spheres with inner diameters of 10, 13, 17, 22, 28 and 37 mm and 4.0, 5.0, 6.2, 7.9, 10 and 13 mm. The target-to-background ratio of the phantom was 4:1, and the background activity concentration was 5.3 kBq/mL. We also evaluated cold spheres containing only non-radioactive water with the same background activity concentration. All images were reconstructed using BPL + time of flight (TOF). The ranges of β values and γ factors in BPL were 50-600 and 2-20, respectively. We reconstructed PET images using the Duetto toolbox for MATLAB software. We calculated the % hot contrast recovery coefficient (CRChot) of each hot sphere, the cold CRC (CRCcold) of each cold sphere, the background variability (BV) and residual lung error (LE). We measured the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the micro hollow hot spheres ≤ 13 mm to assess spatial resolution on the reconstructed PET images.

Results: The CRChotand CRCcoldfor different β values and γ factors depended on the size of the small spheres. The CRChot,CRCcoldand BV increased along with the γ factor. A 6.2-mm hot sphere was obvious in BPL as lower β values and higher γ factors, whereas γ factors ≥ 10 resulted in images with increased background noise. The FWHM became smaller when the γ factor increased.

Conclusion: High and low γ factors, respectively, preserved the edges of reconstructed PET images and promoted image smoothing. The BPL with a γ factor above the default value in Q.Clear (γ factor = 2) generated high-resolution PET images, although image noise slightly diverged. Optimizing the β value and the γ factor in BPL enabled the detection of lesions ≤ 6.2 mm.

TITLE: Significance of Acquisition Parameters for Adipose Tissue Segmentation on CT Images

JOURNAL: AJR. American journal of roentgenology

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
OBJECTIVE.CT-based body composition analysis quantifies skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. However, acquisition parameters and quality can vary between CT images obtained for clinical care, which may lead to unreliable measurements and systematic error. The purpose of this study was to estimate the influence of IV contrast medium, tube current-exposure time product, tube potential, and slice thickness on cross-sectional area (CSA) and mean attenuation of subcutaneous (SAT), visceral (VAT), and inter-muscular adipose tissue (IMAT).MATERIALS AND METHODS.We retrospectively analyzed 244 images from 105 patients. We applied semiautomated threshold-based segmentation to CTA, dual-energy CT, and CT images acquired as part of PET examinations. An axial image at the level of the third lumbar vertebral body was extracted from each examination to generate 139 image pairs. Images from each pair were obtained with the same scanner, from the same patient, and during the same examination. Each image pair varied in only one acquisition parameter, which allowed us to estimate the effect of the parameter using one-sampletor median tests and Bland-Altman plots.RESULTS.IV contrast medium application reduced CSA in each adipose tissue compartment, with percentage change ranging from -0.4% (p= .03) to -9.3% (p< .001). Higher tube potential reduced SAT CSA (median percentage change, -4.2%;p< .001) and VAT CSA (median percentage change, -2.8%;p= .001) and increased IMAT CSA (median percentage change, -5.4%;p= .001). Thinner slices increased CSA in the VAT (mean percentage change, 3.0%;p= .005) and IMAT (median percentage change, 17.3%;p< .001) compartments. Lower tube current-exposure time product had a variable effect on CSA (median percentage change, -3.2% for SAT [p< .001], -12.6% for VAT [p= .001], and 58.8% for IMAT [p< .001]). IV contrast medium and higher tube potential increased mean attenuation, with percentage change ranging from 0.8% to 1.7% (p< .05) and from 6.2% to 20.8% (p< .001), respectively. Conversely, thinner slice and lower tube current-exposure time product reduced mean attenuation, with percentage change ranging from -5.4% to -1.0% (p< .001) and from -8.7% to -1.8% (p< .001), respectively.CONCLUSION.Acquisition parameters significantly affect CSA and mean attenuation of adipose tissue. Details of acquisition parameters used for CT-based body composition analysis need to be scrutinized and reported to facilitate interpretation of research studies.

TITLE: Low-activity [18F]-somatostatin receptor (SSTR) imaging using [18F]SiTATE on a long axial field-of-view PET/CT scanner

AUTHORS: Nils F Trautwein, Eduardo Calderón, Pia M Linder, Gerald Reischl, Philippe Driessen, Wenhong Lan, Andreas S Brendlin, Thorben Groß, Helmut Dittmann, Martina Hinterleitner, Christian la Fougère, Fabian P Schmidt, Lena S Kiefer

JOURNAL: EJNMMI physics

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: 18F-labelled somatostatin receptor tracers have recently gained popularity due to their better spatial resolution, longer half-life and lower costs compared to68Ga-labeled tracers. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact and limitations of reduced administered activities of [18F]SiTATE on image quality, lesion detectability and quantitative PET parameters in a long axial field-of-view (LAFOV) PET/CT scanner.

Methods: Twenty-four patients with histologically confirmed neuroendocrine tumor, who underwent clinically indicated [18F]SiTATE PET/CT examination (3.0 MBq/kg, 5 min PET scan time) on a Siemens Biograph Vision Quadra LAFOV PET/CT, were included retrospectively in this study. PET list-mode data were rebinned for shorter frame durations to simulate 5 min scans with lower activities of injected radiotracer. A comparison of image reconstruction in high sensitivity (HS) and ultra-high sensitivity mode (UHS) mode was performed. Subjective image quality, noise and lesion detectability of n = 122 lesions were rated using a 5-point Likert scale. The molecular tumor volume (MTV), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), tumor-to-liver activity concentration ratio (TLR) and standardized uptake values (SUV) were analyzed.

Results: Subjective image quality decreased with simulated reduction of injected activity with generally superior ratings in the UHS mode compared to the HS mode. Despite a reduction to 1 MBq/kg of [18F]SiTATE all lesions were still detected while at 0.25 MBq/kg lesion detectability decreased to 70% (HS) and 93% (UHS). Only minor changes in SUVmeanand TLR were detected with reduced activity. However, reduced activities led to an increase in SUVSD, which in turn caused a decrease in SNR (at 1 MBq/kg: 7.3 in HS and 9.0 in UHS mode and an increase in deviation of the MTV.

Conclusion: Reducing the administered activity of injected [18F]SiTATE by 66% to 1 MBq/kg (HS & UHS) is feasible in a LAFOV PET/CT scanner, maintaining clinically diagnostic image quality without statistically significant deviations in PET uptake parameters and MTV. Furthermore, in low activity [18F]SiTATE PET/CT, the UHS mode improves image quality and noise as well as lesion detectability compared to HS mode, further reinforcing the clinical benefits of this recently introduced reconstruction mode.

TITLE: Comparing lesion detection efficacy and image quality across different PET system generations to optimize the iodine-124 PET protocol for recurrent thyroid cancer

AUTHORS: David Kersting, Walter Jentzen, Miriam Sraieb, Pedro Fragoso Costa, Maurizio Conti, Lale Umutlu, Gerald Antoch, Michael Nader, Ken Herrmann, Wolfgang Peter Fendler, Christoph Rischpler, Manuel Weber

JOURNAL: EJNMMI physics

ABSTRACT:
Background: In recurrent differentiated thyroid cancer patients, detectability in124I PET is limited for lesions with low radioiodine uptake. We assess the improvements in lesion detectability and image quality between three generations of PET scanners with different detector technologies. The results are used to suggest an optimized protocol.

Methods: Datasets of 10 patients with low increasing thyroglobulin or thyroglobulin antibody levels after total thyroidectomy and radioiodine therapies were included. PET data were acquired and reconstructed on a Biograph mCT PET/CT (whole-body, 4-min acquisition time per bed position; OSEM, OSEM-TOF, OSEM-TOF+PSF), a non-TOF Biograph mMR PET/MR (neck region, 4 min and 20 min; OSEM), and a new generation Biograph Vision PET/CT (whole-body, 4 min; OSEM, OSEM-TOF, OSEM-TOF+PSF). The 20-min image on the mMR was used as reference to calculate the detection efficacy in the neck region. Image quality was rated on a 5-point scale.

Results: All detected lesions were in the neck region. Detection efficacy was 8/9 (Vision OSEM-TOF and OSEM-TOF+PSF), 4/9 (Vision OSEM), 3/9 (mMR OSEM and mCT OSEM-TOF+PSF), and 2/9 (mCT OSEM and OSEM-TOF). Median image quality was 4 (Vision OSEM-TOF and OSEM-TOF+PSF), 3 (Vision OSEM, mCT OSEM-TOF+PSF, and mMR OSEM 20-min), 2 (mCT OSEM-TOF), 1.5 (mCT OSEM), and 1 (mMR OSEM 4 min).

Conclusion: At a clinical standard acquisition time of 4 min per bed position, the new generation Biograph Vision using a TOF-based image reconstruction demonstrated the highest detectability and image quality and should, if available, be preferably used for imaging of low-uptake lesions. A prolonged acquisition time for the mostly affected neck region can be useful.

Recent advancements in material engineering have enabled the development of nanoparticles tailored for various imaging techniques, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography (PET), and ultrasound (US). These nanoscale agents improve sensitivity and specificity, enabling early cancer detection and precise tumor characterization. Monte Carlo (MC) simulations play a pivotal role in optimizing nanomaterial-based imaging by modeling their interactions with biological tissues, predicting contrast enhancement, and refining dosimetry for radiation-based imaging techniques. These computational methods provide valuable insights into nanoparticle behavior, aiding in the design of more effective imaging agents. Moreover, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) approaches are transforming cancer imaging by enhancing image reconstruction, automating segmentation, and improving diagnostic accuracy. AI-driven models can also optimize MC-based simulations by accelerating data analysis and refining nanoparticle design through predictive modeling. This review explores the latest advancements in nanomaterial-based cancer imaging, highlighting the synergy between nanotechnology, MC simulations, and AI-driven innovations. By integrating these interdisciplinary approaches, future cancer imaging technologies can achieve unprecedented precision, paving the way for more effective diagnostics and personalized treatment strategies.

ABSTRACT:
Objective: The preoperative prediction of the overall survival (OS) status of patients with head and neck cancer (HNC) is significant value for their individualized treatment and prognosis. This study aims to evaluate the impact of adding 3D deep learning features to radiomics models for predicting 5-year OS status.

Methods: Two hundred twenty cases from The Cancer Imaging Archive public dataset were included in this study; 2212 radiomics features and 304 deep features were extracted from each case. The features were selected by univariate analysis and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, and then grouped into a radiomics model containing Positron Emission Tomography /Computed Tomography (PET/CT) radiomics features score, a deep model containing deep features score, and a combined model containing PET/CT radiomics features score +3D deep features score. TumorStage model was also constructed using initial patient tumor node metastasis stage to compare the performance of the combined model. A nomogram was constructed to analyze the influence of deep features on the performance of the model. The 10-fold cross-validation of the average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and calibration curve were used to evaluate performance, and Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) was developed for interpretation.

Results: The TumorStage model, radiomics model, deep model, and the combined model achieved areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.604, 0.851, 0.840, and 0.895 on the train set and 0.571, 0.849, 0.832, and 0.900 on the test set. The combined model showed better performance of predicting the 5-year OS status of HNC patients than the radiomics model and deep model. The combined model was shown to provide a favorable fit in calibration curves and be clinically useful in decision curve analysis. SHAP summary plot and SHAP The SHAP summary plot and SHAP force plot visually interpreted the influence of deep features and radiomics features on the model results.

Conclusions: In predicting 5-year OS status in patients with HNC, 3D deep features could provide richer features for combined model, which showed outperformance compared with the radiomics model and deep model.

TITLE: Impact of scanner harmonization on PET-based treatment response assessment in metastatic melanoma

AUTHORS: Amy J Weisman, Tyler J Bradshaw, Mauro Namias, Robert Jeraj

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Patients with metastatic melanoma often receive18F-FDG PET/CT scans on different scanners throughout their monitoring period. In this study, we quantified the impact of scanner harmonization on longitudinal changes in PET standardized uptake values using various harmonization and normalization methods, including an anthropomorphic PET phantom. Twenty metastatic melanoma patients received at least two FDG PET/CT scans, each on two different scanners with an average of 4 months (range: 2-8) between. Scans from a General Electric (GE) Discovery 710 PET CT-1were harmonized to the GE Discovery VCT using image reconstruction settings matching recovery coefficients in an anthropomorphic phantom with bone equivalent inserts and wall-less synthetic lesions. In patient images, SUVmaxwas measured for each melanoma lesion and time-point. Lesions were classified as progressing, stable, or responding based on pre-defined threshold of ±30% change in SUVmax. For comparison, harmonization was also performed using simpler methods, including harmonization using a NEMA phantom, post-reconstruction filtering, reference region normalization of SUVmax, and use of SUVpeakinstead of SUVmax.In the 20 patients, 90 lesions across two time-points were available for treatment response assessment. Treatment response classification changed in 47% (42/90) of cases after harmonization with anthropomorphic phantom. Before harmonization, 37% (33/90) of the lesions were classified as stable (changing less than 30% between two time-points), while the fraction of stable lesions increased to 58% (52/90) after harmonization. Harmonization with the NEMA phantom agreed with harmonization with the anthropomorphic phantom in 91% (82/90) of cases. Post-reconstruction filtering agreed with anthropomorphic phantom-based harmonization in 83% (75/90) cases. The utilization of reference regions for normalization or SUVpeakwas unable to correct for changes as identified by the anthropomorphic phantom-based harmonization. Overall, PET scanner harmonization has a major impact on individual lesion treatment response classification in metastatic melanoma patients. Harmonization using the NEMA phantom yielded similar results to harmonization using anthropomorphic phantom, while the only acceptable post-reconstruction technique was post-reconstruction filtering. Phantom-based harmonization is therefore strongly recommended when comparing lesion uptake across time-points when the images have been acquired on different PET scanners.

TITLE: Effect of 3D Slicer Preoperative Planning and Intraoperative Guidance with Mobile Phone Virtual Reality Technology on Brain Glioma Surgery

AUTHORS: Jun Liu, Xiaodong Li, Xueping Leng, Bo Zhong, Yanhong Liu, Liang Liu

JOURNAL: Contrast media & molecular imaging

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Objective: To explore the effect of 3D Slicer preoperative planning and intraoperative guidance with mobile phone virtual reality (VR) technology on brain glioma surgery.

Methods: By means of retrospective study, the data of 77 brain glioma patients treated in the neurosurgery departments at The Second Affiliated Hospital of Wannan Medical College and Xinhua Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine from January 2015 to January 2022 were analyzed, and the patients were divided into the experimental group (EG,n= 38) and the control group (CG,n= 39) according to the surgical modalities. Before surgery, all patients received positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET/CT) scanning and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination. For patients in EG, the DICOM format images acquired from PET-CT and MRI examinations were imported with the 3D Slicer software for 3D visual fusion reconstruction, acquiring VR images, and developing detailed preoperative planning. Then, the reconstructed images were imported into the Sina software on a mobile phone, and the surgery was performed with the assistance of VR technology; for patients in CG, traditional 2D images were used for tumor contour drawing by the subjective visual method, and the craniotomy was performed under a traditional microscope. Patients' surgery indicators and Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) scores were compared between the two groups.

Results: The number of cases with total resection, rate of total resection, hospital stay after surgery, and surgery time were significantly better in EG than in CG (P< 0.05); after treatment, the KPS score was significantly higher in EG than in CG (75.66 ± 4.01 vs 65.36 ± 5.23,P< 0.001).

Conclusion: Combining 3D Slicer preoperative planning with intraoperative mobile phone VR technology can promote the accuracy of brain glioma surgery, which is conducive to effectively removing tumors while protecting patients' neural function.

TITLE: SAFFusion: a saliency-aware frequency fusion network for multimodal medical image fusion

AUTHORS: Renhe Liu, Yu Liu, Han Wang, Junxian Li, Kai Hu

JOURNAL: Biomedical optics express

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Medical image fusion integrates complementary information from multimodal medical images to provide comprehensive references for clinical decision-making, such as the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and the detection and segmentation of brain tumors. Although traditional and deep learning-based fusion methods have been extensively studied, they often fail to devise targeted strategies that fully utilize distinct regional or feature-specific information. This paper proposes SAFFusion, a saliency-aware frequency fusion network that integrates intensity and texture cues from multimodal medical images. We first introduce Mamba-UNet, a multiscale encoder-decoder architecture enhanced by the Mamba design, to improve global modeling in feature extraction and image reconstruction. By employing the contourlet transform in Mamba-UNet, we replace conventional pooling with multiscale representations and decompose spatial features into high- and low-frequency subbands. A dual-branch frequency feature fusion module then fuses cross-modality information according to the distinct characteristics of these frequency subbands. Furthermore, we apply latent low-rank representation (LatLRR) to assess image saliency and implement adaptive loss constraints to preserve information in salient and non-salient regions. Quantitative results on CT/MRI, SPECT/MRI, and PET/MRI fusion tasks show that SAFFusion outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Qualitative evaluations confirm that SAFFusion effectively merges prominent intensity features and rich textures from multiple sources.

TITLE: Feasibility study of patient-specific dose verification in proton therapy utilizing positron emission tomography (PET) and generative adversarial network (GAN)

AUTHORS: Saiqun Ma, Zongsheng Hu, Kuangkuang Ye, Xiaoke Zhang, Yuenan Wang, Hao Peng

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Online dose verification based on proton-induced positron emitters is a promising strategy for quality assurance in proton therapy. Because of the nonlinear correlation between dose and the activity distributions, a machine learning-based approach was developed to establish their relationship.

Methods: Simulations were carried out using a pencil beam scanning system and a computed tomography (CT) image-based phantom. A DiscoGAN model was developed to perform dose verification for both central and off-center lines. Besides the activity as input, HU information from CT images and stopping power (SP) prior were incorporated as auxiliary features for the model. The performance was quantitatively studied in terms of mean absolute error (MAE) and mean relative error (MRE), under different signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). In addition to a dataset comprising monoenergetic beams, two additional datasets were generated to evaluate the model's generalization capability: five reconstructed PET images based on an in-beam PET system and a dataset comprising spread-out Bragg peaks (SOBPs).

Results: The feasibility of dose verification was successfully demonstrated for all three datasets. For the monoenergetic case (i.e., raw activity of positron emitters), the MRE is found to be <1% for the central lines and 5% for the off-center lines, respectively. The range uncertainty is found to be less than 1 mm. The prediction based on five PET images, which take into account the detection of 511-keV photons and image reconstruction, yields slightly inferior performance. For the SOBP case, the MRE of the center lines is found to be <3% and the range uncertainty is <1 mm. The inclusion of anatomical information (HU and SP) improves both accuracy and generalization of the DiscoGAN model.

Conclusion: The combination of proton-induced positron emitters, in-beam PET, and machine learning may become a useful tool allowing for patient-specific online dose verification in proton therapy.

TITLE: [News on the imaging of large vessel vasculitis]

AUTHORS: Valentin S Schäfer, Simon M Petzinna, Wolfgang A Schmidt

JOURNAL: Zeitschrift fur Rheumatologie

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Large vessel vasculitis, including giant cell arteritis (GCA) and Takayasu arteritis (TAK), are autoimmune diseases primarily affecting the aorta and its branches. GCA is the most common primary vasculitis. Inflammatory changes in the vessel walls can cause serious complications such as amaurosis, stroke, and aortic dissection and rupture. Imaging techniques have become an integral part for the diagnosis and monitoring of large vessel vasculitis, allowing for effective disease monitoring. GCA and TAK exhibit similar patterns of vascular distribution. However, the temporal arteries are never involved in TAK, and axillary arteritis occurs more frequently in GCA. In most centers, ultrasound of the temporal and axillary arteries has replaced temporal artery biopsy as the primary diagnostic tool for GCA. In addition to ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), and [18F]-FDG (fluorodeoxyglucose) positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET) are important, particularly for visualizing the aorta. Moreover, PET-CT is now also capable of assessing the temporal arteries, although it is not yet widely available. In polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR), ultrasound of the shoulder and hip regions is part of the ACR/EULAR classification criteria. MRI allows detailed visualization of additional inflammatory extraarticular manifestations, showing characteristic inflammatory lesions in entheses, tendons, and ligaments. [18F]-FDG-PET-CT also enables the visualization of musculoskeletal inflammation, especially in the shoulder and hip regions, as well as paravertebral areas. Ultrasound can detect subclinical GCA in up to 23% of patients with PMR, which should be treated like GCA. Technological innovations such as new radiotracers and improved MRI imaging could further enhance the diagnosis and monitoring of large vessel vasculitis and PMR, thus playing a crucial role in improving the prognosis through faster initiation of therapy.

JOURNAL: World journal of nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
ObjectiveThis study aims to assess the impact of various regions of interest (ROIs) and volumes of interest (VOIs) delineations on the reproducibility of liver signal-to-noise-ratio (SNRliver) measurements, as well as to find the most reproducible way to estimate it in gallium-68 positron emission tomography (68Ga-PET) imaging. We also investigated the SNRliver-weight relationship for these ROIs and VOIs delineations.MethodsA cohort of 40 patients (40 males; mean weight: 76.5 kg [58-115 kg]) with prostate cancer were included.68Ga-PET/CT imaging (mean injected activity: 91.4 MBq [51.2 MBq to 134.1 MBq] was performed on a 5-ring bismuth germanium oxide-based Discovery IQ PET/CT using ordered subset expectation maximization image reconstruction algorithm. Afterward, circular ROIs and spherical VOIs with two different diameters of 30 and 40 mm were drawn on the right lobe of the livers. The performance of the various defined regions was evaluated by the average standardized uptake value (SUVmean), standard deviation (SD) of the SUV (SUVSD), SNRliver, and SD of the SNRlivermetrics.ResultsThere were no significant differences in SUVmeanamong the various ROIs and VOIs (p> 0.05). On the other hand, the lower SUVSDwas obtained by spherical VOI with diameter of 30 mm. The largest SNRliverwas obtained by ROI (30 mm). The SD of SNRliverwith ROI (30 mm) was also the largest, while the lowest SD of SNRliverwas observed for VOI (40 mm). There is a higher correlation coefficient between the patient-dependent parameter of weight and the image quality parameter of SNRliver for both VOI (30 mm) and VOI (40 mm) compared to the ROIs.ConclusionOur results indicate that SNRlivermeasurements are affected by the size and shape of the respective ROIs and VOIs. The spherical VOI with a 40 mm diameter leads to more stable and reproducible SNR measurement in the liver.

JOURNAL: EJNMMI research

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Background: We investigated the image quality of11C,68Ga,18F and89Zr, which have different positron fractions, physical half-lifes and positron ranges. Three small animal positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) systems were used in the evaluation, including the Siemens Inveon, RAYCAN X5 and Molecubes β-cube. The evaluation was performed on a single scanner level using the national electrical manufacturers association (NEMA) image quality phantom and analysis protocol. Acquisitions were performed with the standard NEMA protocol for18F and using a radionuclide-specific acquisition time for11C,68Ga and89Zr. Images were assessed using percent recovery coefficient (%RC), percentage standard deviation (%STD), image uniformity (%SD), spill-over ratio (SOR) and evaluation of image quantification.

Results: 68Ga had the lowest %RC (< 62%) across all systems.18F had the highest maximum %RC (> 85%) and lowest %STD for the 5 mm rod across all systems. For11C and89Zr, the maximum %RC was close (> 76%) to the %RC with18F. A larger SOR were measured in water with11C and68Ga compared to18F on all systems. SOR in air reflected image reconstruction and data correction performance. Large variation in image quantification was observed, with maximal errors of 22.73% (89Zr, Inveon), 17.54% (89Zr, RAYCAN) and - 14.87% (68Ga, Molecubes).

Conclusions: The systems performed most optimal in terms of NEMA image quality parameters when using18F, where11C and89Zr performed slightly worse than18F. The performance was least optimal when using68Ga, due to large positron range. The large quantification differences prompt optimization not only by terms of image quality but also quantification. Further investigation should be performed to find an appropriate calibration and harmonization protocol and the evaluation should be conducted on a multi-scanner and multi-center level.

JOURNAL: World journal of nuclear medicine

ABSTRACT:
The aim of this study is to simulate GE Discovery 690 VCT positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scanner using Geant4 Application for Tomographic Emission (GATE) simulation package (version 8). Then, we assess the performance of scanner by comparing measured and simulated parameter results. Detection system and geometry of PET scanner that consists of 13,824 LYSO crystals designed in 256 blocks and 24 ring detectors were modeled. In order to achieve a precise model, we verified scanner model. Validation was based on a comparison between simulation data and experimental results obtained with this scanner in the same situation. Parameters used for validation were sensitivity, spatial resolution, and contrast. Image quality assessment was done based on comparing the contrast recovery coefficient (CRC) of simulated and measured images. The findings demonstrate that the mean difference between simulated and measured sensitivity is <7%. The simulated spatial resolution agreed to within <5.5% of the measured values. Contrast results had a slight divergence within the range below 4%. The image quality validation study demonstrated an acceptable agreement in CRC for 8:1 and 2:1 source-to-background activity ratio. Validated performance parameters showed good agreement between experimental data and simulated results and demonstrated that GATE is a valid simulation tool for simulating this scanner model. The simulated model of this scanner can be used for future studies regarding optimization of image reconstruction algorithms and emission acquisition protocols.

TITLE: Quantitative and clinical implications of the EARL2 versus EARL1 [18F]FDG PET-CT performance standards in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma

AUTHORS: Maurice C Cox, Tijn Jurcka, Anne I J Arens, Maartje C van Rijk, Johannes H A M Kaanders, Sven van den Bosch

JOURNAL: EJNMMI research

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Background: The EANM Research Ltd. (EARL) guidelines give recommendations for harmonization of [18F]FDG PET-CT image acquisition and reconstruction, aiming to ensure reproducibility of quantitative data between PET scanners. Recent technological advancements in PET-CT imaging resulted in an updated version of the EARL guidelines (EARL2). The aim of this study is to compare quantitative [18F]FDG uptake metrics of the primary tumor and lymph nodes in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) on EARL2 versus EARL1 reconstructed images and to describe clinical implications for nodal staging and treatment.

Methods: Forty-nine consecutive patients with HNSCC were included. For all, both EARL1 and EARL2 images were reconstructed from a singular [18F]FDG PET-CT scan. Primary tumors and non-necrotic lymph nodes ≥ 5 mm were delineated on CT-scan. In the quantitative analysis, maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmax) and standardized uptake ratios (SURmax, i.e., SUVmaxnormalized to cervical spinal cord uptake) were calculated for all lesions on EARL1 and EARL2 reconstructions. Metabolic tumor volume (MTV) and total lesion glycolysis were compared between EARL1 and EARL2 using different segmentation methods (adaptive threshold; SUV2.5/3.5/4.5; SUR2.5/3.5/4.5; MAX40%/50%). In the qualitative analysis, each lymph node was scored independently by two nuclear medicine physicians on both EARL1 and EARL2 images on different occasions using a 4-point scale.

Results: There was a significant increase in SUVmax(16.5%) and SURmax(9.6%) of primary tumor and lymph nodes on EARL2 versus EARL1 imaging (p < 0.001). The proportional difference of both SUVmaxand SURmaxbetween EARL2 and EARL1 decreased with increasing tumor volume (p < 0.001). Absolute differences in MTVs between both reconstructions were small (< 1.0 cm3), independent of the segmentation method. MTVs decreased on EARL2 using relative threshold methods (adaptive threshold; MAX40%/50%) and increased using static SUV or SUR thresholds. With visual scoring of lymph nodes 38% (11/29) of nodes with score 2 on EARL1 were upstaged to score 3 on EARL2, which resulted in an alteration of nodal stage in 18% (6/33) of the patients.

Conclusions: Using the EARL2 method for PET image reconstruction resulted in higher SUVmaxand SURmaxcompared to EARL1, with nodal upstaging in a significant number of patients.

TITLE: Cardiac perfusion by positron emission tomography

AUTHORS: Wail Nammas, Teemu Maaniitty, Juhani Knuuti, Antti Saraste

JOURNAL: Clinical physiology and functional imaging

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) with positron emission tomography (PET) is an established tool for evaluation of obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD). The contemporary 3-dimensional scanner technology and the state-of-the-art MPI radionuclide tracers and pharmacological stress agents, as well as the cutting-edge image reconstruction techniques and data analysis software, have all enabled accurate, reliable and reproducible quantification of absolute myocardial blood flow (MBF), and henceforth calculation of myocardial flow reserve (MFR) in several clinical scenarios. In patients with suspected coronary artery disease, both absolute stress MBF and MFR can identify myocardial territories subtended by epicardial coronary arteries with haemodynamically significant stenosis, as defined by invasive coronary fractional flow reserve measurement. In particular, absolute stress MBF and MFR offered incremental prognostic information for predicting adverse cardiac outcome, and hence for better patient risk stratification, over those provided by traditional clinical risk predictors. This article reviews the available evidence to support the translation of the current techniques and technologies into a useful decision-making tool in real-world clinical practice.

TITLE: Generation of attenuation correction factors from time-of-flight PET emission data using high-resolution residual U-net

AUTHORS: Tuo Yin, Takashi Obi

JOURNAL: Biomedical physics & engineering express

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Attenuation correction of annihilation photons is essential in PET image reconstruction for providing accurate quantitative activity maps. In the absence of an aligned CT device to obtain attenuation information, we propose the high-resolution residual U-net (HRU-Net) to extract attenuation correction factors (ACF) directly from time-of-flight (TOF) PET emission data. HRU-Net is built upon the U-Net encoding-decoding architecture and it utilizes four blocks of modified residual connections in each stage. In each residual block, concatenation is performed to incorporate input and output feature vectors. In addition, flexible and efficient elements of convolutional neural network (CNN) such as dilated convolutions, pre-activation order of a batch normalization (BN) layer, a rectified linear unit (ReLU) layer and a convolution layer, and residual connections are utilized to extract high resolution features. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, HRU-Net estimated ACF, attenuation maps and activity maps are compared with maximum likelihood ACF (MLACF) algorithm, U-Net, and HC-Net. An ablation study is conducted using non-TOF and TOF sinograms as inputs of networks. The experimental results show that HRU-Net with TOF projections as inputs leads to normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) of 4.84% ± 1.58%, outperforming MLACF, U-Net and HC-Net with NRMSE of 47.82% ± 13.62%, 6.92% ± 1.94%, and 7.99% ± 2.49%, respectively.

TITLE: A systematic review of the challenges, emerging solutions and applications, and future directions of PET/MRI in Parkinson's disease

AUTHORS: Isabella Hoi Kei Leung, Mark William Strudwick

JOURNAL: EJNMMI reports

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
PET/MRI is a hybrid imaging modality that boasts the simultaneous acquisition of high-resolution anatomical data and metabolic information. Having these exceptional capabilities, it is often implicated in clinical research for diagnosing and grading, as well as tracking disease progression and response to interventions. Despite this, its low level of clinical widespread use is questioned. This is especially the case with Parkinson's disease (PD), the fastest progressively disabling and neurodegenerative cause of death. To optimise the clinical applicability of PET/MRI for diagnosing, differentiating, and tracking PD progression, the emerging novel uses, and current challenges must be identified. This systematic review aimed to present the specific challenges of PET/MRI use in PD. Further, this review aimed to highlight the possible resolution of these challenges, the emerging applications and future direction of PET/MRI use in PD. EBSCOHost (indexing CINAHL Plus, PsycINFO) Ovid (Medline, EMBASE) PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus from 2006 (the year of first integrated PET/MRI hybrid system) to 30 September 2022 were used to search for relevant primary articles. A total of 933 studies were retrieved and following the screening procedure, 18 peer-reviewed articles were included in this review. This present study is of great clinical relevance and significance, as it informs the reasoning behind hindered widespread clinical use of PET/MRI for PD. Despite this, the emerging applications of image reconstruction developed by PET/MRI research data to the use of fully automated systems show promising and desirable utility. Furthermore, many of the current challenges and limitations can be resolved by using much larger-sampled and longitudinal studies. Meanwhile, the development of new fast-binding tracers that have specific affinity to PD pathological processes is warranted.

ABSTRACT:
Due to the major improvements in the hardware and image reconstruction algorithms, positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MR) is now a reliable state-of-the-art hybrid modality in medical practice. Currently, it can provide a broad range of advantages in preclinical and clinical imaging compared to single-modality imaging. In the second part of this review, we discussed the further clinical applications of PET/MR. In the chest, PET/MR has particular potential in the oncology setting, especially when utilizing ultrashort/zero echo time MR sequences. Furthermore, cardiac PET/MR can provide reliable information in evaluating myocardial inflammation, cardiac amyloidosis, myocardial perfusion, myocardial viability, atherosclerotic plaque, and cardiac masses. In gastrointestinal and hepato-pancreato-biliary malignancies, PET/MR is able to precisely detect metastases to the liver, being superior over the other imaging modalities. In genitourinary and gynaecology applications, PET/MR is a comprehensive diagnostic method, especially in prostate, endometrial, and cervical cancers. Its simultaneous acquisition has been shown to outperform other imaging techniques for the detection of pelvic nodal metastases and is also a reliable modality in radiation planning. Lastly, in haematologic malignancies, PET/MR can significantly enhance lymphoma diagnosis, particularly in detecting extra-nodal involvement. It can also comprehensively assess treatment-induced changes. Furthermore, PET/MR may soon become a routine in multiple myeloma management, being a one-stop shop for evaluating bone, bone marrow, and soft tissues.

ABSTRACT:
Background: The digital-BGO PET/CT system, Omni Legend 32, incorporates modified block sequential regularized expectation maximization (BSREM) image reconstruction and a deep learning-based time-of-flight (TOF)-like image quality enhancement process called Precision DL (PDL). The present study aimed to define the fundamental characteristics of PDL using phantom and clinical images.

Methods: A NEMA IEC body phantom was scanned using the Omni Legend 32 PET/CT system. All PET/CT images were acquired over 60 and 90 s per bed position, with a 384 × 384 matrix. Phantom images were reconstructed using OSEM + PSF and BSREM at β values of 100-1,000, combined with low (LPDL), medium (MPDL), and high (HPDL) PDL. We evaluated contrast recovery, background variability, and the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of a 10 mm hot sphere. Thirty clinical whole-body18F-FDG PET/CT examinations were included. Clinical images were reconstructed using OSEM + PSF and BSREM at β values of 200, 300, 400, 500, and 600, determined based on findings from the phantom study, combined with the three PDL models. Noise levels, mean SUV (SUVmean), and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the liver as well as signal-to-background ratios (SBR) and maximum SUV (SUVmax) of lesions were evaluated. Two blinded readers evaluated visual image quality and rated several aspects to complement the analysis.

Results: Contrast recovery and background variability decreased as the β value increased. This trend was consistent even when PDL processing was added to BSREM. Increased strength of the PDL models led to higher CNR. Noise levels decreased as a function of increasing β values in BSREM, resulting in a higher SNR, but lower SBR. Combining PDL with BSREM resulted in all β values producing better results in terms of noise, SBR, and SNR than OSEM + PSF. As the PDL increased (LPDL < MPDL < HPDL), noise levels, SBR, and SNR became higher. The β values of 400, 200, 300, and 300 for BSREM, LPDL, MPDL, and HPDL, respectively, resulted in noise equivalent to OSEM + PSF but significantly increased the SUVmax(9%, 15%, 18%, and 27%), SBR (16%, 17%, 20%, and 32%), and SNR (17%, 19%, 31%, and 36%), respectively. The visual evaluation of image quality yielded similar scores across BSREM + PDL reconstructions, although BSREM with β = 600 combined with MPDL delivered the best overall image quality and total mean score.

Conclusion: The combination of BSREM and PDL significantly enhanced the SUVmaxof lesions and image quality compared with OSEM + PSF. A combination of BSREM at β values of 500-600 and MPDL is recommended for oncological whole-body PET/CT imaging when using PDL on the Omni Legend.

AUTHORS: Kazuhiro Kitajima, Masayuki Fujiwara, Tomonori Terada, Kazuma Noguchi, Hiromitsu Kishimoto, Koichiro Yamakado

JOURNAL: Hellenic journal of nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Objective: To investigate the clinical utility of the 3D quantitative values derived from fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT) and bone single-photon computed tomography-computed tomography (SPECT/CT) for the diagnosis of osteoradionecrosis (ORN) of the jaw.

Subjects and methods: Thirty four patients with head and neck cancer who had a history of radiotherapy and clinically diagnosed as ORN and who undertaken18F-FDG PET/CT (n=23) or quantitative bone SPECT/CT (n=11) were enrolled. Standardized uptake values (SUV), including maximum SUV (SUVmax), peak SUV (SUVpeak), and mean SUV (SUVmean), as well as metabolic lesion volume (MLV), representing total volume above threshold, and total lesion uptake (TLU), calculated as MLVxSUVmean were determined.

Results: In18F-FDG PET/CT results, mean values (range) of SUVmax, SUVpeak, SUVmean, MLV, and TLU of 24 lesions were 6.72±2.62 (3.67~14.36), 5.25±2.05 (2.46~10.88), 3.77±1.33 (1.74~7.69), 11.49±9.61 (1.54~43.14), and 49.07±59.26 (4.44~271.05), respectively. In quantitative bone SPECT/CT results, mean values (range) of SUVmax, SUVpeak, SUVmean, MLV, and TLU of 16 lesions were 5.26±0.89 (3.71~7.07), 4.62±0.78 (3.09~6.02), 3.44±0.46 (2.68~4.32), 14.45±9.93 (1.48~33.32), and 49.72±35.51 (4.60~127.86), respectively.

Conclusion: As objective and reliable indicators, 3D quantitative values (SUV and volume) derived from18F-FDG PET/CT and quantitative bone SPECT/CT results are useful for evaluation of the disease activity of ORN of the jaw.

TITLE: Research into super-resolution in medical imaging from 2000 to 2023: bibliometric analysis and visualization

AUTHORS: Jiachuan He, He Ma, Miaoran Guo, Jiaqi Wang, Zhongqing Wang, Guoguang Fan

JOURNAL: Quantitative imaging in medicine and surgery

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Background: Super-resolution (SR) refers to the use of hardware or software methods to enhance the resolution of low-resolution (LR) images and produce high-resolution (HR) images. SR is applied frequently across a variety of medical imaging contexts, particularly in the enhancement of neuroimaging, with specific techniques including SR microscopy-used for diagnostic biomarkers-and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)-a neuroimaging method for the measurement and mapping of brain activity. This bibliometric analysis of the literature related to SR in medical imaging was conducted to identify the global trends in this field, and visualization via graphs was completed to offer insights into future research prospects.

Methods: In order to perform a bibliometric analysis of the SR literature, this study sourced all publications from the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) database published from January 1, 2000, to October 11, 2023. A total of 3,262 articles on SR in medical imaging were evaluated. VOSviewer was used to perform co-occurrence and co-authorship analysis, and network visualization of the literature data, including author, journal, publication year, institution, and keywords, was completed.

Results: From 2000 to 2023, the annual publication volume surged from 13 to 366. The top three journals in this field in terms of publication volume were as follows: (I)Scientific Reports(86 publications), (II)IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging(74 publications), and (III)IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics Ferroelectrics and Frequency Control(56 publications). The most prolific country, institution, and author were the United States (1,017 publications; 31,301 citations), the Chinese Academy of Sciences (124 publications; 2,758 citations), and Dinggang Shen (20 publications; 671 citations), respectively. A cluster analysis of the top 100 keywords was conducted, which revealed the presence of five co-occurrence clusters: (I) SR and artificial intelligence (AI) for medical image enhancement, (II) SR and inverse problem processing concepts for positron emission tomography (PET) image processing, (III) SR ultrasound through microbubbles, (IV) SR microscopy for Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases, and (V) SR in brain fMRI: rapid acquisition and precise imaging. The most recent high-frequency keywords weredeep learning(DL),magnetic resonance imaging(MRI), andconvolutional neural networks(CNNs).

Conclusions: Over the past two decades, the output of publications by countries, institutions, and authors in the field of SR in medical imaging has steadily increased. Based on bibliometric analysis of international trends, the resurgence of SR in medical imaging has been facilitated by advancements in AI. The increasing need for multi-center and multi-modal medical images has further incentivized global collaboration, leading to the diverse research paths in SR medical imaging among prominent scientists.

TITLE: Towards Non-Invasive Lung Tumor Tracking Based on Patient Specific Model of Respiratory System

AUTHORS: Hamid Ladjal, Michael Beuve, Philippe Giraud, Behzad Shariat

JOURNAL: IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
The goal of this paper is to calculate a complex internal respiratory and tumoral movements by measuring respiratory air flows and thorax movements. In this context, we present a new lung tumor tracking approach based on a patient-specific biomechanical model of the respiratory system, which takes into account the physiology of respiratory motion to simulate the real non-reproducible motion. The behavior of the lungs, is directly driven by the simulated actions of the breathing muscles, i.e. the diaphragm and the intercostal muscles (the rib cage). In this paper, the lung model is monitored and controlled by a personalized lung pressure/volume relationship during a whole respiratory cycle. The lung pressure and rib kinematics are patient specific and obtained by surrogate measurement. The rib displacement corresponding to the transformation which was computed by finite helical axis method from the end of exhalation (EE) to the end of inhalation (EI). The lung pressure is calculated by an optimization framework based on inverse finite element analysis, by minimizing the lung volume errors, between the respiratory volume (respiratory airflow exchange) and the simulated volume (calculated by biomechanical simulation). We have evaluated the model accuracy on five public datasets. We have also evaluated the lung tumor motion identified in 4D CT scan images and compared it with the trajectory that was obtained by finite element simulation. The effects of rib kinematics on lung tumor trajectory were investigated. Over all phases of respiration, our developed model is able to predict the lung tumor motion with an average landmark error of [Formula: see text]. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our physics-based model. We believe that this model can be potentially used in 4D dose computation, removal of breathing motion artifacts in positron emission tomography (PET) or gamma prompt image reconstruction.

TITLE: Quantitative evaluation of PSMA PET imaging using a realistic anthropomorphic phantom and shell-less radioactive epoxy lesions

AUTHORS: Roberto Fedrigo, Dan J Kadrmas, Patricia E Edem, Lauren Fougner, Ivan S Klyuzhin, M Peter Petric, François Bénard, Arman Rahmim, Carlos Uribe

JOURNAL: EJNMMI physics

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Background: Positron emission tomography (PET) with prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) have shown superior performance in detecting metastatic prostate cancers. Relative to [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]FDG) PET images, PSMA PET images tend to visualize significantly higher-contrast focal lesions. We aim to evaluate segmentation and reconstruction algorithms in this emerging context. Specifically, Bayesian or maximum a posteriori (MAP) image reconstruction, compared to standard ordered subsets expectation maximization (OSEM) reconstruction, has received significant interest for its potential to reach convergence with minimal noise amplifications. However, few phantom studies have evaluated the quantitative accuracy of such reconstructions for high contrast, small lesions (sub-10 mm) that are typically observed in PSMA images. In this study, we cast 3 mm-16-mm spheres using epoxy resin infused with a long half-life positron emitter (sodium-22;22Na) to simulate prostate cancer metastasis. The anthropomorphic Probe-IQ phantom, which features a liver, bladder, lungs, and ureters, was used to model relevant anatomy. Dynamic PET acquisitions were acquired and images were reconstructed with OSEM (varying subsets and iterations) and BSREM (varying β parameters), and the effects on lesion quantitation were evaluated.

Results: The22Na lesions were scanned against an aqueous solution containing fluorine-18 (18F) as the background. Regions-of-interest were drawn with MIM Software using 40% fixed threshold (40% FT) and a gradient segmentation algorithm (MIM's PET Edge+). Recovery coefficients (RCs) (max, mean, peak, and newly defined "apex"), metabolic tumour volume (MTV), and total tumour uptake (TTU) were calculated for each sphere. SUVpeakand SUVapexhad the most consistent RCs for different lesion-to-background ratios and reconstruction parameters. The gradient-based segmentation algorithm was more accurate than 40% FT for determining MTV and TTU, particularly for lesions [Formula: see text] 6 mm in diameter (R2= 0.979-0.996 vs. R2= 0.115-0.527, respectively).

Conclusion: An anthropomorphic phantom was used to evaluate quantitation for PSMA PET imaging of metastatic prostate cancer lesions. BSREM with β = 200-400 and OSEM with 2-5 iterations resulted in the most accurate and robust measurements of SUVmean, MTV, and TTU for imaging conditions in18F-PSMA PET/CT images. SUVapex, a hybrid metric of SUVmaxand SUVpeak, was proposed for robust, accurate, and segmentation-free quantitation of lesions for PSMA PET.

TITLE: UMC-PET: a fast and flexible Monte Carlo PET simulator

AUTHORS: Pablo Galve, Fernando Arias-Valcayo, Amaia Villa-Abaunza, Paula Ibáñez, José Manuel Udías

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Objective.The GPU-based Ultra-fast Monte Carlo positron emission tomography simulator (UMC-PET) incorporates the physics of the emission, transport and detection of radiation in PET scanners. It includes positron range, non-colinearity, scatter and attenuation, as well as detector response. The objective of this work is to present and validate UMC-PET as a a multi-purpose, accurate, fast and flexible PET simulator.Approach.We compared UMC-PET against PeneloPET, a well-validated MC PET simulator, both in preclinical and clinical scenarios. Different phantoms for scatter fraction (SF) assessment following NEMA protocols were simulated in a 6R-SuperArgus and a Biograph mMR scanner, comparing energy histograms, NEMA SF, and sensitivity for different energy windows. A comparison with real data reported in the literature on the Biograph scanner is also shown.Main results.NEMA SF and sensitivity estimated by UMC-PET where within few percent of PeneloPET predictions. The discrepancies can be attributed to small differences in the physics modeling. Running in a 11 GB GeForce RTX 2080 Ti GPU, UMC-PET is ∼1500 to ∼2000 times faster than PeneloPET executing in a single core Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU W-2155 @ 3.30 GHz.Significance.UMC-PET employs a voxelized scheme for the scanner, patient adjacent objects (such as shieldings or the patient bed), and the activity distribution. This makes UMC-PET extremely flexible. Its high simulation speed allows applications such as MC scatter correction, faster SRM estimation for complex scanners, or even MC iterative image reconstruction.

TITLE: Image reconstruction and analysis of atherosclerosis imaging by [18F]FDG PETCT using digital PET technology

AUTHORS: Stephen Rankin, A J Gemmell, J McClure, B Venugopal, P J Slomka, M C Petrie, N N Lang, D Colville, Alexander Small

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Digital PETCT scanners have improved spatial resolution and sensitivity. This may have implications for reconstruction parameters and atherosclerosis assessment using [18F]FDG. On a contemporary digital scanner, we assessed European Association of Nuclear Medicine's (EANM)-recommended reconstruction parameters and blood pool methods, compared with a locally-optimised protocol using fewer iterations and subsets than recommended by EANM.

Methods: Using clinical PETCT and phantom analysis, we quantitatively assessed two reconstructions ('EANM' and 'local') for atherosclerotic assessment using mean contrast recovery (MCR), absolute error and coefficient of variation (CoV). We assessed the impact of each reconstruction on tissue-to-background ratio (TBR). We also assessed the differences within four blood pool regions on repeated imaging over 24-weeks.

Results: EANM reconstruction yielded higher TBRmax, 4.28 ± 0.65 vs 1.81 ± 0.24 p < 0.0001, than local reconstruction. Phantom data demonstrated a higher RCmax curve with EANM vs local reconstruction. EANM MCR was 1.87 vs 1.23 with local reconstruction, with higher absolute error (2.23 vs 0.61) and variation (7.63% vs 4.14%), vs local reconstruction. Superior vena cava (SVC) offered the most reproducible and reliable blood pool data. Internal jugular vein had lower FDG-uptake compared to other regions, resulting in higher TBRmax, but was less reproducible between scans over 24 weeks.

Conclusion: Local reconstruction, with fewer iterations and subsets compared to EANM recommendations, resulted in more accurate atherosclerotic assessment on a contemporary digital scanner. Metrics for assessing reconstructions, such as absolute error and CoV, provided valuable information. The blood pool region used affects TBR. SVC appears to provide the most reliable blood pool region.

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance (PET/MR) imaging has gone through major hardware improvements in recent years, making it a reliable state-of-the-art hybrid modality in clinical practice. At the same time, image reconstruction, attenuation correction, and motion correction algorithms have significantly evolved to provide high-quality images. Part I of the current review discusses technical basics, pre-clinical applications, and clinical applications of PET/MR in radiation oncology and head and neck imaging. PET/MR offers a broad range of advantages in preclinical and clinical imaging. In the preclinic, small and large animal-dedicated devices were developed, making PET/MR capable of delivering new insight into animal models in diseases and facilitating the development of methods that inform clinical PET/MR. Regarding PET/MR's clinical applications in radiation medicine, PET and MR already play crucial roles in the radiotherapy process. Their combination is particularly significant as it can provide molecular and morphological characteristics that are not achievable with other modalities. In addition, the integration of PET/MR information for therapy planning with linear accelerators is expected to provide potentially unique biomarkers for treatment guidance. Furthermore, in clinical applications in the head and neck region, it has been shown that PET/MR can be an accurate modality in head and neck malignancies for staging and resectability assessment. Also, it can play a crucial role in diagnosing residual or recurrent diseases, reliably distinguishing from oedema and fibrosis. PET/MR can furthermore help with tumour characterization and patient prognostication. Lastly, in head and neck carcinoma of unknown origin, PET/MR, with its diagnostic potential, may obviate multiple imaging sessions in the near future.

TITLE: FDG-PET/CT Variants and Pitfalls in Haematological Malignancies

AUTHORS: Patrick Pilkington, Egesta Lopci, Judit A Adam, Carsten Kobe, Karolien Goffin, Ken Herrmann

JOURNAL: Seminars in nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Hematologic malignancies represent a vast group of hematopoietic and lymphoid cancers that typically involve the blood, the bone marrow, and the lymphatic organs. Due to extensive research and well defined and standardized response criteria, the role of [18F]FDG-PET/CT is well defined in these malignancies. Never the less, the reliability of visual and quantitative interpretation of PET/CT may be impaired by several factors including inconsistent scanning protocols and image reconstruction methods. Furthermore, the uptake of [18F]FDG not only reflects tissue glucose consumption by malignant lesions, but also in other situations such as in inflammatory lesions, local and systemic infections, benign tumors, reactive thymic hyperplasia, histiocytic infiltration, among others; or following granulocyte colony stimulating factors therapy, radiation therapy, chemotherapy or surgical interventions, all of which are a potential source of false-positive or negative interpretations. Therefore it is of paramount importance for the Nuclear Medicine Physician to be familiar with, not only the normal distribution of [18F]FDG in the body, but also with the most frequent findings that may hamper a correct interpretation of the scan, which could ultimately alter the patients management. In this review, we describe these myriad of situations so the interpreting physician can be familiar with them, providing tools for their correct identification and interpretation when possible.

TITLE: Radiologic Assessment of Osteosarcoma Lung Metastases: State of the Art and Recent Advances

AUTHORS: Anna Maria Chiesa, Paolo Spinnato, Marco Miceli, Giancarlo Facchini

JOURNAL: Cells

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
The lung is the most frequent site of osteosarcoma (OS) metastases, which are a critical point in defining a patient's prognosis. Chest computed tomography (CT) represents the gold standard for the detection of lung metastases even if its sensitivity widely ranges in the literature since lung localizations are often atypical. ESMO guidelines represent one of the major references for the follow-up program of OS patients. The development of new reconstruction techniques, such as the iterative method and the deep learning-based image reconstruction (DLIR), has led to a significant reduction of the radiation dose with the low-dose CT. The improvement of these techniques has great importance considering the young-onset of the disease and the strict chest surveillance during follow-up programs. The use of18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/CT is still controversial, while volume doubling time (VDT) and computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems are recent diagnostic tools that could support radiologists for lung nodules evaluation. Their use, well-established for other malignancies, needs to be further evaluated, focusing on OS patients.

TITLE: Optimizing LM-DRAMA parameters and non-local means filtering to improve small-lesion detectability in SiPM-based TOF breast PET

AUTHORS: Takuro Shiiba, Hana Katakami, Aiko Naito, Maki Takamura, Masanobu Ishiguro, Masanori Watanabe, Masaki Uno

JOURNAL: Physical and engineering sciences in medicine

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
This study aimed to optimize image reconstruction parameters for a dedicated time-of-flight (TOF) breast positron emission tomography (PET) system equipped with silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) that maximize lesion detectability while minimizing image noise. A cylindrical phantom containing four hot spheres (3-10 mm diameter) was scanned at sphere-to-background ratios of 4:1, 6:1, and 8:1. All data were reconstructed using a 3D list-mode dynamic row-action maximum likelihood algorithm with β values of 10-200, followed by non-local means (NLM) filtering at intensities of 0.5-2.0 or no filtering. Image quality was evaluated using background coefficient of variation (COVBG), contrast recovery coefficient (CRC), and detectability index (DI) for the 3 mm sphere. As β increased, CRC and DI improved, particularly for smaller spheres and higher SBRs; however, background noise also rose. Applying the NLM filter reduced COVBG, especially when increasing the filter intensity from 0.5 to 1.0, although noise reduction gains plateaued at intensities above 1.0. Optimal trade-offs in lesion detectability and noise were observed at moderate β (50-100) with NLM intensities of 1.0-1.5, yielding higher CRC and DI without excessive background noise or blurring effects. A balanced approach to β and NLM filtering substantially enhances small-lesion visibility in SiPM-based TOF-dedicated breast PET imaging. These findings offer a practical framework for parameter selection, supporting better lesion detectability and advancing breast cancer diagnostics through more sensitive PET protocols.

AUTHORS: Marcel Awenius, Helen Abeln, Melanie Müller, Vanessa L Franke, Gino Rincon, Christin Glowa, Michaela Schmitt, Renate Bangert, Dominik Ludwig, Andreas B Schmidt, Tristan A Kuder, Mark E Ladd, Peter Bachert, Philipp Biegger, Andreas Korzowski

JOURNAL: Magnetic resonance in medicine

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: To demonstrate the feasibility of 3D echo-planar spectroscopic imaging (EPSI) technique with rapid volumetric radial k-space sampling for hyperpolarized (HP)13C magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) in vivo.

Methods: A radial EPSI (rEPSI) was implemented on a 3 T clinical PET/MR system. To enable volumetric coverage, the sinusoidal shaped readout gradients per k-t-spoke were rotated along the three spatial dimensions in a golden-angle like manner. A distance-weighted, density-compensated gridding reconstruction was used, also in cases with undersampling of spokes in k-space. Measurements without and with HP13C-labeled substances were performed in phantoms and rats using a double-resonant13C/1H volume resonator with 72 mm inner diameter.

Results: Phantom measurements demonstrated the feasibility of the implemented rEPSI sequence, as well as the robustness to undersampling in k-space up to a factor of 5 without advanced reconstruction techniques. Applied to measurements with HP [1-13C]pyruvate in a tumor-bearing rat, we obtained well-resolved MRSI datasets with a large matrix size of 123voxels covering the whole imaging FOV of (180 mm)3within 6.3 s, enabling to observe metabolism in dynamic acquisitions.

Conclusion: After further optimization, the proposed rEPSI method may be useful in applications of HP13C-tracers where unknown or varying metabolite resonances are expected, and the acquisition of dynamic, volumetric MRSI datasets with an adequate temporal resolution is a challenge.

JOURNAL: Cell reports. Medicine

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Accurate diagnosis and precise estimation of disease progression states are crucial for developing effective treatment plans for patients with parkinsonism. Although various deep learning-based computer-aided diagnostic models have demonstrated benefits, they have been relatively underexplored in parkinsonism owing to limited data and lack of external validation. We introduce the hierarchical wavelet diffusion autoencoder (HWDAE), a generative self-supervised model trained with 1,934 dopamine transporter positron emission tomography (DAT PET) images. HWDAE learns relevant disease traits during generative training, prior to supervision with human labels, as evidenced by its ability to synthesize realistic images representing different disease states of Parkinson's disease. The pretrained HWDAE is subsequently adapted for two differential diagnostic tasks and one disease progression estimation task, tested on images from two medical centers. Our training approach introduces a paradigm for deep learning research utilizing PET and expands the potential of DAT PET as a biomarker for Parkinson's disease.

TITLE: Physics and technology of time-of-flight PET detectors

AUTHORS: Dennis R Schaart

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
The imaging performance of clinical positron emission tomography (PET) systems has evolved impressively during the last ∼15 years. A main driver of these improvements has been the introduction of time-of-flight (TOF) detectors with high spatial resolution and detection efficiency, initially based on photomultiplier tubes, later silicon photomultipliers. This review aims to offer insight into the challenges encountered, solutions developed, and lessons learned during this period. Detectors based on fast, bright, inorganic scintillators form the scope of this work, as these are used in essentially all clinical TOF-PET systems today. The improvement of the coincidence resolving time (CRT) requires the optimization of the entire detection chain and a sound understanding of the physics involved facilitates this effort greatly. Therefore, the theory of scintillation detector timing is reviewed first. Once the fundamentals have been set forth, the principal detector components are discussed: the scintillator and the photosensor. The parameters that influence the CRT are examined and the history, state-of-the-art, and ongoing developments are reviewed. Finally, the interplay between these components and the optimization of the overall detector design are considered. Based on the knowledge gained to date, it appears feasible to improve the CRT from the values of 200-400 ps achieved by current state-of-the-art TOF-PET systems to about 100 ps or less, even though this may require the implementation of advanced methods such as time resolution recovery. At the same time, it appears unlikely that a system-level CRT in the order of ∼10 ps can be reached with conventional scintillation detectors. Such a CRT could eliminate the need for conventional tomographic image reconstruction and a search for new approaches to timestamp annihilation photons with ultra-high precision is therefore warranted. While the focus of this review is on timing performance, it attempts to approach the topic from a clinically driven perspective, i.e. bearing in mind that the ultimate goal is to optimize the value of PET in research and (personalized) medicine.

JOURNAL: PloS one

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
The main arteries that supply blood to the brain originate from the Circle of Willis (CoW). The CoW exhibits considerable anatomical variations which may have clinical importance, but the variability is insufficiently characterised in the general population. We assessed the anatomical variability of CoW variants in a community-dwelling sample (N = 1,864, 874 men, mean age = 65.4, range 40-87 years), and independent and conditional frequencies of the CoW's artery segments. CoW segments were classified as present or missing/hypoplastic (w/1mm diameter threshold) on 3T time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography images. We also examined whether age and sex were associated with CoW variants. We identified 47 unique CoW variants, of which five variants constituted 68.5% of the sample. The complete variant was found in 11.9% of the subjects, and the most common variant (27.8%) was missing both posterior communicating arteries. Conditional frequencies showed patterns of interdependence across most missing segments in the CoW. CoW variants were associated with mean-split age (P = .0147), and there was a trend showing more missing segments with increasing age. We found no association with sex (P = .0526). Our population study demonstrated age as associated with CoW variants, suggesting reduced collateral capacity with older age.

Background: Positron emission tomography (PET) is extensively employed for diagnosing and staging various tumors, including liver cancer, lung cancer, and lymphoma. Accurate subtype classification of tumors plays a crucial role in formulating effective treatment plans for patients. Notably, lymphoma comprises subtypes like diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and Hodgkin's lymphoma, while lung cancer encompasses adenocarcinoma, small cell carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma. Similarly, liver cancer consists of subtypes such as cholangiocarcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma. Consequently, the subtype classification of tumors based on PET images holds immense clinical significance. However, in clinical practice, the number of cases available for each subtype is often limited and imbalanced. Therefore, the primary challenge lies in achieving precise subtype classification using a small dataset.

Method: This paper presents a novel approach for tumor subtype classification in small datasets using RA-DL (Radiomics-DeepLearning) attention. To address the limited sample size, Support Vector Machines (SVM) is employed as the classifier for tumor subtypes instead of deep learning methods. Emphasizing the importance of texture information in tumor subtype recognition, radiomics features are extracted from the tumor regions during the feature extraction stage. These features are compressed using an autoencoder to reduce redundancy. In addition to radiomics features, deep features are also extracted from the tumors to leverage the feature extraction capabilities of deep learning. In contrast to existing methods, our proposed approach utilizes the RA-DL-Attention mechanism to guide the deep network in extracting complementary deep features that enhance the expressive capacity of the final features while minimizing redundancy. To address the challenges of limited and imbalanced data, our method avoids using classification labels during deep feature extraction and instead incorporates 2D Region of Interest (ROI) segmentation and image reconstruction as auxiliary tasks. Subsequently, all lesion features of a single patient are aggregated into a feature vector using a multi-instance aggregation layer.

Result: Validation experiments were conducted on three PET datasets, specifically the liver cancer dataset, lung cancer dataset, and lymphoma dataset. In the context of lung cancer, our proposed method achieved impressive performance with Area Under Curve (AUC) values of 0.82, 0.84, and 0.83 for the three-classification task. For the binary classification task of lymphoma, our method demonstrated notable results with AUC values of 0.95 and 0.75. Moreover, in the binary classification task of liver tumor, our method exhibited promising performance with AUC values of 0.84 and 0.86.

Conclusion: The experimental results clearly indicate that our proposed method outperforms alternative approaches significantly. Through the extraction of complementary radiomics features and deep features, our method achieves a substantial improvement in tumor subtype classification performance using small PET datasets.

TITLE: Semi-automated 18F-FDG PET segmentation methods for tumor volume determination in Non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients: a literature review, implementation and multi-threshold evaluation

AUTHORS: Kylie Keijzer, Anne G H Niezink, Janneke W de Boer, Jaap A van Doesum, Walter Noordzij, Tom van Meerten, Lisanne V van Dijk

ABSTRACT:
In the treatment of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), multiple therapeutic options are available. Improving outcome predictions are essential to optimize treatment. The metabolic active tumor volume (MATV) has shown to be a prognostic factor in NHL. It is usually retrieved using semi-automated thresholding methods based on standardized uptake values (SUV), calculated from18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography (18F-FDG PET) images. However, there is currently no consensus method for NHL. The aim of this study was to review literature on different segmentation methods used, and to evaluate selected methods by using an in house created software tool. A software tool,MUltipleSUVThreshold (MUST)-segmenter was developed where tumor locations are identified by placing seed-points on the PET images, followed by subsequent region growing. Based on a literature review, 9 SUV thresholding methods were selected and MATVs were extracted. The MUST-segmenter was utilized in a cohort of 68 patients with NHL. Differences in MATVs were assessed with paired t-tests, and correlations and distributions figures. High variability and significant differences between the MATVs based on different segmentation methods (p< 0.05) were observed in the NHL patients. Median MATVs ranged from 35 to 211 cc. No consensus for determining MATV is available based on the literature. Using the MUST-segmenter with 9 selected SUV thresholding methods, we demonstrated a large and significant variation in MATVs. Identifying the most optimal segmentation method for patients with NHL is essential to further improve predictions of toxicity, response, and treatment outcomes, which can be facilitated by the MUST-segmenter.

ABSTRACT:
Computational decision support systems could provide clinical value in whole-body FDG-PET/CT workflows. However, limited availability of labeled data combined with the large size of PET/CT imaging exams make it challenging to apply existing supervised machine learning systems. Leveraging recent advancements in natural language processing, we describe a weak supervision framework that extracts imperfect, yet highly granular, regional abnormality labels from free-text radiology reports. Our framework automatically labels each region in a custom ontology of anatomical regions, providing a structured profile of the pathologies in each imaging exam. Using these generated labels, we then train an attention-based, multi-task CNN architecture to detect and estimate the location of abnormalities in whole-body scans. We demonstrate empirically that our multi-task representation is critical for strong performance on rare abnormalities with limited training data. The representation also contributes to more accurate mortality prediction from imaging data, suggesting the potential utility of our framework beyond abnormality detection and location estimation.

ABSTRACT:
Abnormal tau inclusions are hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease and predictors of clinical decline. Several tau PET tracers are available for neurodegenerative disease research, opening avenues for molecular diagnosis in vivo. However, few have been approved for clinical use. Understanding the neurobiological basis of PET signal validation remains problematic because it requires a large-scale, voxel-to-voxel correlation between PET and (immuno) histological signals. Large dimensionality of whole human brains, tissue deformation impacting co-registration, and computing requirements to process terabytes of information preclude proper validation. We developed a computational pipeline to identify and segment particles of interest in billion-pixel digital pathology images to generate quantitative, 3D density maps. The proposed convolutional neural network for immunohistochemistry samples, IHCNet, is at the pipeline's core. We have successfully processed and immunostained over 500 slides from two whole human brains with three phospho-tau antibodies (AT100, AT8, and MC1), spanning several terabytes of images. Our artificial neural network estimated tau inclusion from brain images, which performs with ROC AUC of 0.87, 0.85, and 0.91 for AT100, AT8, and MC1, respectively. Introspection studies further assessed the ability of our trained model to learn tau-related features. We present an end-to-end pipeline to create terabytes-large 3D tau inclusion density maps co-registered to MRI as a means to facilitate validation of PET tracers.

TITLE: Evaluation of a digital bismuth germanium oxide PET/CT system according to the Japanese brain tumor phantom test for 18F-fluciclovine imaging

AUTHORS: Shohei Fukai, Hiromitsu Daisaki, Honoka Yoshida, Naoki Shimada, Kazuki Motegi, Atsushi Osawa, Takashi Terauchi

JOURNAL: Physical and engineering sciences in medicine

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
The Omni Legend (GE Healthcare), equipped with a digital bismuth germanium oxide PET/CT system, has been recently developed. However, the performance of the Omni Legend without a time-of-flight (TOF) system for18F-fluciclovine imaging is still unclear. Therefore, this study evaluated the image quality of the Omni Legend according to the Japanese brain tumor phantom test (JBT) criteria, and assessed its potential use for18F-fluciclovine imaging. This study followed the JBT procedures. A brain tumor phantom, which includes six hot spheres of different diameters, was filled with an18F-fluorodeoxyglucose solution with a radioactivity concentration ratio of 3 (spheres):1 (background). PET scanning was performed using the Omni Legend with a 30-min list mode acquisition. The PET data were reconstructed using an ordered subset expectation maximization (OSEM), an OSEM with point spread function (OSEM + PSF), and a Bayesian penalized likelihood (BPL) under standard clinical parameters. The image quality was evaluated using the JBT criteria, including contrast for a 7.5-mm sphere, recovery coefficient (RC) for a 10.0-mm sphere, standardized uptake value of total background (SUVTOT), and detectability for a 7.5-mm sphere. The contrast, RC, and SUVTOTwere 25.1%, 0.70, and 1.00, respectively in OSEM; 25.8%, 0.80, and 0.99 in OSEM + PSF; and 33.8%, 0.93, and 0.99 in BPL. The 7.5-mm sphere was detected by all three methods. All of the JBT criteria were satisfied, regardless of the PET image reconstruction methods. This study demonstrated that the Omni Legend without TOF satisfies all JBT criteria and has the potential to provide high-quality images in18F-fluciclovine imaging.

TITLE: Unraveling the 3D Genome Architecture in Plants: Present and Future

AUTHORS: Weizhi Ouyang, Dan Xiong, Guoliang Li, Xingwang Li

JOURNAL: Molecular plant

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
The eukaryotic genome has a hierarchical three-dimensional (3D) organization with functional implications for DNA replication, DNA repair, and transcriptional regulation. Over the past decade, scientists have endeavored to elucidate the spatial characteristics and functions of plant genome architecture using high-throughput chromatin conformation capturing technologies such as Hi-C, ChIA-PET, and HiChIP. Here, we systematically review current understanding of chromatin organization in plants at multiple scales. We also discuss the emerging opinions and concepts in 3D genome research, focusing on state-of-the-art 3D genome techniques, RNA-chromatin interactions, liquid-liquid phase separation, and dynamic chromatin alterations. We propose the application of single-cell/single-molecule multi-omics, multiway (DNA-DNA, DNA-RNA, and RNA-RNA interactions) chromatin conformation capturing methods, and proximity ligation-independent 3D genome-mapping technologies to explore chromatin organization structure and function in plants. Such methods could reveal the spatial interactions between trait-related SNPs and their target genes at various spatiotemporal resolutions, and elucidate the molecular mechanisms of the interactions among DNA elements, RNA molecules, and protein factors during the formation of key traits in plants.

TITLE: A whole gamma imaging prototype for higher quantitative imaging of89Zr-labeled antibodies in a tumor mouse model

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Objective.Positron emission tomography (PET) has become an important clinical modality, but it is limited to imaging the annihilation radiation from positron-electron collisions. Recently, PET imaging with89Zr, which has a half-life of 3 d, has attracted much attention in immuno-PET to visualize immune cells and cancer cells by targeting specific antibodies on the cell surface. However,89Zr emits a single gamma ray at 909 keV four times more frequently than positrons, causing image quality (IQ) degradation in conventional PET. To overcome this drawback, use of such single gamma rays for imaging was previously proposed as whole gamma imaging (WGI). In WGI, a single gamma ray is detected by Compton imaging; by inserting a scatter detector ring inside the PET ring, WGI can realize both PET imaging and Compton imaging in one modality. A prototype for WGI was developed and Compton imaging of a mouse after intravenous administration of89Zr oxalate was demonstrated. However, the Compton imaging of the single gamma ray still presented a challenge due to its low IQ compared to PET.Approach.In this study, the scatter detector insert of the earlier WGI prototype was redesigned with the aim of improving Compton imaging performance. The new prototype produced WGI images by additive averaging of PET and Compton images after optimizing the ratio of each iteration in the image reconstruction. WGI IQ was then evaluated using the NEMA NU4 IQ phantom, and a tumor-burdened mouse was imaged with WGI up to 12 d after89Zr labeled antibody injection.Main results.Consequently, the Compton imaging performance was improved by lowering the angular resolution measure from 6.7 degrees to 6.4 degrees and the sensitivity from 0.11% to 0.18% compared to the previous prototype WGI. The phantom images with WGI showed a 15% reduction in noise and a 3% increase in contrast recovery under low-statistical conditions compared to images reconstructed by PET data alone.Significance. In-vivomouse imaging with the new prototype WGI was successfully performed. This successful imaging leads to the expectation that future whole-body WGI imaging will enable more sensitive and better quantitative89Zr antigen-antibody reaction imaging to be obtained.

TITLE: Photon and Proton Dose Painting Based on Oxygen Distribution - Feasibility Study and Tumour Control Probability Assessment

AUTHORS: Ana Ureba, Jakob Ödén, Iuliana Toma-Dasu, Marta Lazzeroni

JOURNAL: Advances in experimental medicine and biology

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Solid tumours may present hypoxic sub-regions of increased radioresistance. Hypoxia quantification requires of clinically implementable, non-invasive and reproducible techniques as positron emission tomography (PET). PET-based dose painting strategies aiming at targeting those sub-regions may be limited by the resolution gap between the PET imaging resolution and the smaller scale at which hypoxia occurs. The ultimate benefit of the usage of dose painting may be reached if the planned dose distribution can be performed and delivered consistently. This study aimed at assessing the feasibility of two PET-based dose painting strategies using two beam qualities (photon or proton beams) in terms of tumour control probability (TCP), accounting for underlying oxygen distribution at sub-millimetre scale.A tumour oxygenation model at submillimetre scale was created consisting of three regions with different oxygen partial pressure distributions, being hypoxia decreasing from core to periphery. A published relationship between uptake and oxygen partial pressure was used and a PET image of the tumour was simulated. The fundamental effects that limit the PET camera resolution were considered by processing the uptake distribution with a Gaussian 3D filter and re-binning to a PET image voxel size of 2 mm. Prescription doses to overcome tumour hypoxia were calculated based on the processed images, and planned using robust optimisation.Normal tissue complication probabilities and TCPs after the delivery of the planned doses were calculated for the nominal plan and the lowest bounds of the dose volume histograms resulting from the robust scenarios planned, taking into account the underlying oxygenation at submillimetre scale. Results were presented for the two beam qualities and the two dose painting strategies: by contours (DPBC) and by using a voxel grouping-based approach (DPBOX).In the studied case, DPBOX outperforms DPBC with respect to TCP regardless the beam quality, although both dose painting strategy plans demonstrated robust target coverage.

JOURNAL: Journal of integrative neuroscience

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between dopamine transporter (DAT) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) and the clinical characteristics and rating scales of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. Additionally, we sought to assess the scientific validity and feasibility of integrating 3D-dopaminergic binding parameters into the clinical scoring system for PD.

Methods: A total of 75 patients with PD who underwent11C-methyl-N-2β-methyl ester-3β-(4-fluorophenyl) tropane (11C-CFT) PET/CT from April, 2019 to June, 2021 were retrospectively analyzed. Clinical characteristics, including age, sex, and disease duration, as well as the modified Hoehn-Yahr (H-Y) scale, Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) parts II and III (II-III), and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores of PD patients during the corresponding time periods were collected. DAT binding parameters and their derived parameters based on plane and 3D images in the neostriatum were analyzed for consistency with plane and 3D parameters, and the correlation between DAT parameters and the clinical features of patients were assessed using SPSS software.

Results: The DAT binding parameters derived from 3D images demonstrated good consistency with the plane parameters (p< 0.05). The asymmetry index (ai) of DAT binding parameters based on 3D and plane images showed good consistency in the anterior putamen (p< 0.05). The plane parameters of the anterior and posterior putamen were statistically correlated with the UPDRS II-III score and H-Y score of PD patients (p< 0.05), whereas those of the caudate nucleus were correlated with UPDRS II and MMSE scores. The 3D parameters in the neostriatum showed good statistical correlation with disease duration, UPDRS II-III score, H-Y score, and H-Y stage of PD patients (p< 0.05), and the ai was significantly correlated with MMSE score (p< 0.05). The 3D parameters in the putamen and posterior putamen exhibited significant statistical correlation with the UPDRS II-III score, H-Y score, and H-Y stage in PD patients (p< 0.05). The ai in the putamen showed statistical correlation with UPDRS III and MMSE scores, and the ai in the posterior putamen showed statistical correlation with UPDRS II score (p< 0.05).

Conclusions: Quantitative parameters based on plane and 3D images of11C-CFT PET/CT showed good consistency. Moreover, 3D parameters in the neostriatum had a stronger correlation with activities of daily living, UPDRS motor scores, disease severity and duration, and cognition compared with plane parameters in PD patients.

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: The aim of this study was to investigate conditions for reliable quantification of sub-centimeter lesions with low18F,68Ga, and124I uptake using a silicon photomultiplier-based PET/CT system.

Methods: A small tumor phantom was investigated under challenging but clinically realistic conditions resembling prostate and thyroid cancer lymph node metastases (6 spheres with 3.7-9.7 mm in diameter, 9 different activity concentrations ranging from about 0.25-25 kBq/mL, and a signal-to-background ratio of 20). Radionuclides with different positron branching ratios and prompt gamma coincidence contributions were investigated. Maximum-, contour-, and oversize-based partial volume effect (PVE) correction approaches were applied. Detection and quantification performance were estimated, considering a ±30 % deviation between imaged-derived and true activity concentrations as acceptable. A standard and a prolonged acquisition time and two image reconstruction algorithms (time-of-flight with/without point spread function modelling) were analyzed. Clinical data were evaluated to assess agreement of PVE-correction approaches indicating lesion quantification validity.

Results: The smallest 3.7-mm sphere was not visible. If the lesions were clearly observed, quantification was, except for a few cases, acceptable using contour- or oversized-based PVE-corrections. Quantification accuracy did not substantially differ between18F,68Ga, and124I. No systematic differences between the analyzed reconstruction algorithms or shorter and larger acquisition times were observed. In the clinical evaluation of 20 lesions, an excellent statistical agreement between oversize- and contour-based PVE-corrections was observed.

Conclusions: At the lower end of size (<10 mm) and activity concentration ranges of lymph-node metastases, quantification with reasonable accuracy is possible for18F,68Ga, and124I, possibly allowing pre-therapeutic lesion dosimetry and individualized radionuclide therapy planning.

TITLE: Deep Learning for Medical Image-Based Cancer Diagnosis

AUTHORS: Xiaoyan Jiang, Zuojin Hu, Shuihua Wang, Yudong Zhang

JOURNAL: Cancers

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
(1) Background: The application of deep learning technology to realize cancer diagnosis based on medical images is one of the research hotspots in the field of artificial intelligence and computer vision. Due to the rapid development of deep learning methods, cancer diagnosis requires very high accuracy and timeliness as well as the inherent particularity and complexity of medical imaging. A comprehensive review of relevant studies is necessary to help readers better understand the current research status and ideas. (2) Methods: Five radiological images, including X-ray, ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission computed tomography (PET), and histopathological images, are reviewed in this paper. The basic architecture of deep learning and classical pretrained models are comprehensively reviewed. In particular, advanced neural networks emerging in recent years, including transfer learning, ensemble learning (EL), graph neural network, and vision transformer (ViT), are introduced. Five overfitting prevention methods are summarized: batch normalization, dropout, weight initialization, and data augmentation. The application of deep learning technology in medical image-based cancer analysis is sorted out. (3) Results: Deep learning has achieved great success in medical image-based cancer diagnosis, showing good results in image classification, image reconstruction, image detection, image segmentation, image registration, and image synthesis. However, the lack of high-quality labeled datasets limits the role of deep learning and faces challenges in rare cancer diagnosis, multi-modal image fusion, model explainability, and generalization. (4) Conclusions: There is a need for more public standard databases for cancer. The pre-training model based on deep neural networks has the potential to be improved, and special attention should be paid to the research of multimodal data fusion and supervised paradigm. Technologies such as ViT, ensemble learning, and few-shot learning will bring surprises to cancer diagnosis based on medical images.

TITLE: Research on a noise-suppression super-resolution enhancement module for positron flow field images based on convolution and SwinTransformer structures

AUTHORS: Xiao Hui, Liu Quan, Xu YiBing, Wang Ming, Liu JianTang

JOURNAL: Scientific reports

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Positron emission tomography (PET) technology, with its advantages of strong γ-photon penetration and results unaffected by temperature or electromagnetic fields, has emerged as a novel non-contact monitoring technique for industrial flow fields under harsh conditions. However, dynamic sampling leads to a severe lack of photon data within individual time frames, resulting in an ill-posed nature of positron image reconstruction, which introduces uncertainty in noise statistical characteristics and degradation in imaging quality. This paper proposes a novel noise-suppressing super-resolution enhancement module for positron flow field imaging. The module, based on convolution and SwinTransformer structures, achieves noise reduction and enhancement of positron images under conditions of severe photon scarcity. Furthermore, a multi-loss fusion performance evaluation system is constructed to extract texture and hierarchical feature information from the images. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed module effectively reduces image noise while preserving critical information, achieving significant improvements in the quality of generated positron flow field images.

AUTHORS: Edwin C Pratt, Alejandro Lopez-Montes, Alessia Volpe, Michael J Crowley, Lukas M Carter, Vivek Mittal, Nagavarakishore Pillarsetty, Vladimir Ponomarev, Jose M Udías, Jan Grimm, Joaquin L Herraiz

JOURNAL: Nature biomedical engineering

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
In conventional positron emission tomography (PET), only one radiotracer can be imaged at a time, because all PET isotopes produce the same two 511 keV annihilation photons. Here we describe an image reconstruction method for the simultaneous in vivo imaging of two PET tracers and thereby the independent quantification of two molecular signals. This method of multiplexed PET imaging leverages the 350-700 keV range to maximize the capture of 511 keV annihilation photons and prompt γ-ray emission in the same energy window, hence eliminating the need for energy discrimination during reconstruction or for signal separation beforehand. We used multiplexed PET to track, in mice with subcutaneous tumours, the biodistributions of intravenously injected [124I]I-trametinib and 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose, [124I]I-trametinib and its nanoparticle carrier [89Zr]Zr-ferumoxytol, and the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) and infused PSMA-targeted chimaeric antigen receptor T cells after the systemic administration of [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 and [124I]I. Multiplexed PET provides more information depth, gives new uses to prompt γ-ray-emitting isotopes, reduces radiation burden by omitting the need for an additional computed-tomography scan and can be implemented on preclinical and clinical systems without any modifications in hardware or image acquisition software.

TITLE: Augmented reality for epilepsy surgery: Examining usability and efficacy in presurgical planning

AUTHORS: Rishit Chilappa, Abhi Kapuria, Jefferson Norwood, Athena Yao, Matthew Vestal, Muhammad Shahzad Zafar

JOURNAL: Epileptic disorders : international epilepsy journal with videotape

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Objective: The aim of this paper was to visualize 3-dimensional (3-D) brain and electrode placement data for epilepsy surgery within an augmented reality (AR) environment using a wearable headset, with the ultimate goal of enhancing presurgical planning for epilepsy surgery and understanding the efficiency and utility of such a program in a clinical setting. The evaluation process for surgical intervention in epilepsy cases involves a series of extensive tests, including EEG, MRI, PET, SPECT, and fMRI. A second phase of assessment incorporates the placement of depth electrodes within the brain to record seizure activity. The culmination of these complex data is presented to the neurosurgery team for the formulation of a surgical plan. However, the conventional presentation of intricate 3-D data on a 2-dimensional (2-D) computer monitor limits the ability to convey the full depth and detail of the patient's brain and electrode data.

Methods: Five images were selected from a cohort of patients being evaluated for refractory epilepsy at a single center. Their presurgical MRI scans, SEEG electrode data, and CT scans were utilized to generate 3-D AR representations, which were uploaded onto the Duke Augmented Reality Epilepsy Planner (AREP), an application on the Microsoft HoloLens 2. A survey was administered to faculty members to determine usability and effectiveness of the application.

Results: AR images of the brain and electrodes, allowing resizing, movement, and rotation, with distinct colors differentiating tissue and electrodes, were presented in AREP. The application featured an interactive image manipulation menu. Survey results from 18 faculty members regarding seven questions indicated that AREP was user-friendly and can be effective in presurgical planning moving forward.

Significance: AR integration of medical imaging data for epilepsy surgery transcends its role as a communication tool. It provides a deeper representation of surgical anatomy and serves as a valuable method for fostering communication among clinicians.

AUTHORS: Zachary Ells, Vinicius Ludwig, Adam B Weiner, Koichiro Kimura, Andrea Farolfi, Karim Chamie, Joseph Shirk, Nicholas M Donin, Robert Reiter, Johannes Czernin, Jeremie Calais, Magnus Dahlbom

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Introduction: Surgeons commonly use cross sectional images to plan and prepare for surgical procedures. However, cognitively translating 2D images to surgical settings can be difficult and lead to sub-optimal resections. Lymph node dissection can be challenging due to the inability to locate small metastatic lesions, and their proximity to at-risk organ(s). 3D volume rendered (3D-VR) patient specific images can help to address these challenges. We created patient-specific 3D-VR images using freely available open-source programs.

Methods: This study included patients part of the clinical trialNCT04857502. Patients received a PET/CT prior to radioguided surgery. 3D Slicer was used to segment anatomy of interest (organs and tumor lesion(s)). After segmentation, the data was exported as an .OBJ file with an accompanying .MTL file. Manipulation of the .MTL file to restore model properties to the .OBJ file, were completed and both files were uploaded into Autodesk Viewer. Surgeons then received an email link to access the finished 3D-VR model on their smartphone or laptop for peri-operative preparation and/or guidance.

Results: The method was used in a series of 14 patients with prostate cancer undergoing pelvic lymph node dissection with PSMA-radioguided robotic surgery using pre-operative PSMA PET/CT images acquired on average 103 ± 69 days prior to resection. The creation of the 3D-VR models was successfully conducted in all 14 cases. In all cases, the lesions identified on the pre-operative PET/CT imaging 3D-VR models were successfully removed during surgery.

Conclusion: We created patient-specific anatomical 3D-VR models that the surgeons can use for pre-surgical planning and intraoperative tumor localization, by applying free, open-source software that could be used in any procedure requiring careful and strategical planning.

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: This study evaluates a three-dimensional (3D) deep learning (DL) model based on fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT) for predicting the preoperative status of spread through air spaces (STAS) in patients with clinical stage I lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD).

Methods: A retrospective analysis of 162 patients with stage I LUAD was conducted, splitting data into training and test sets (4:1). Six 3D DL models were developed, and the top-performing PET and CT models (ResNet50) were fused for optimal prediction. The model's clinical utility was assessed through a two-stage reader study.

Results: The fused PET/CT model achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.956 (95% CI 0.9230-0.9881) in the training set and 0.889 (95% CI 0.7624-1.0000) in the test set. Compared to three physicians, the model demonstrated superior sensitivity and specificity. After the artificial intelligence (AI) assistance's participation, the diagnostic accuracy of the physicians improved during their subsequent reading session.

Conclusion: Our DL model demonstrates potential as a resource to aid physicians in predicting STAS status and preoperative treatment planning for stage I LUAD, though prospective validation is required.

TITLE: Four decades of mapping and quantifying neuroreceptors at work in vivo by positron emission tomography

AUTHORS: Albert Gjedde, Dean F Wong

JOURNAL: Frontiers in neuroscience

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Decryption of brain images is the basis for the necessary translation of the findings from imaging to information required to meet the demands of clinical intervention. Tools of brain imaging, therefore, must satisfy the conditions dictated by the needs for interpretation in terms of diagnosis and prognosis. In addition, the applications must serve as fundamental research tools that enable the understanding of new therapeutic drugs, including compounds as diverse as antipsychotics, antidepressants, anxiolytics, and drugs serving the relief of symptoms from neurochemical disorders as unrelated as multiple sclerosis, stroke, and dementia. Here we review and explain the kinetics of methods that enable researchers to describe the brain's work and functions. We focus on methods invented by neurokineticists and expanded upon by practitioners during decades of experimental work and on the methods that are particularly useful to predict possible future approaches to the treatment of neurochemical disorders. We provide an overall description of the basic elements of kinetics and the underlying quantification methods, as well as the mathematics of modeling the recorded brain dynamics embedded in the images we obtainin vivo. The complex presentation to follow is necessary to justify the contribution of modeling to the development of methods and to support the specifications dictated by the proposed use in clinical settings. The quantification and kinetic modeling processes are equally essential to image reconstruction and labeling of brain regions of structural or functional interest. The procedures presented here are essential tools of scientific approaches to all conventional and novel forms of brain imaging. The foundations of the kinetic and quantitative methods are keys to the satisfaction of clinicians that actively engage in treating the neurochemical disorders of mammalian brains in the fields of neurology, neurosurgery, and neuropsychiatry.

TITLE: The current status of CZT SPECT myocardial blood flow and reserve assessment: Tips and tricks

AUTHORS: Konstantin V Zavadovsky, Andrew V Mochula, Alina N Maltseva, Vladimir V Shipulin, Svetlana I Sazonova, Marina O Gulya, Ricardo Liga, Alessia Gimelli

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear cardiology : official publication of the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Cardiac PET-derived measurements of myocardial blood flow (MBF) and myocardial flow reserve (MFR) are proven robust indexes of the severity of coronary artery disease (CAD). They facilitate the diagnosis of diffuse epicardial and microvascular disease and are also of prognostic significance. However, low availability and high cost have limited their wide clinical implementation. Over the last 15 years, cadmium zinc telluride (CZT)-based detectors have been implemented into SPECT imaging devices. Myocardial perfusion scintigraphy can be performed faster and with less radiation exposure as compared with standard gamma cameras. Rapid dynamic SPECT studies with higher count rates can be performed. This technological breakthrough has renewed the interest in SPECT MBF assessment in patients with CAD. Currently, two cardiac-centered CZT gamma cameras are available commercially-Discovery NM530c and D-SPECT. They differ in parameters such as collimator design, number of detectors, sensitivity, spatial resolution and image reconstruction. A number of publications have focused on the feasibility of dynamic CZT SPECT and on the correlation with cardiac PET and invasive coronary angiography measurements of fractional flow reserve. Current study reviews the present status of MBF and MFR assessment with CZT SPECT. It also aims to provide an overview of specific issues related to acquisition, processing and interpretation of quantitative studies in patients with CAD.

TITLE: Nuclear Medicine Imaging Procedures in Oncology

AUTHORS: Ajay-Mohan Mohan, Nicola Beindorff, Winfried Brenner

JOURNAL: Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Nuclear medicine radionuclide imaging is a quantitative imaging modality based on radioisotope-labeled tracers which emit radiation in the form of photons used for image reconstruction. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET) are the two noninvasive tomographic three-dimensional radionuclide imaging procedures for both clinical and preclinical settings. In this review on nuclear medicine imaging procedures in oncology, a variety of standard SPECT and PET tracers including radioiodine,18Fluorine fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG), and68Gallium-labeled small proteins like Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA) or somatostatin analogues and their application as targeted molecular imaging probes for improved tumor diagnosis and tumor phenotype characterization are described. Absolute and semiquantitative approaches for calculation of tracer uptake in tumors during the course of disease and during treatment allow further insight into tumor biology, and the combination of SPECT and PET with anatomical imaging procedures like computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) by hybrid SPECT/CT, PET/CT, and PET/MRI scanners provides both anatomical information and tumor functional characterization within one imaging session. With the recent establishment of novel molecular radiolabeled probes for specific tumor diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment monitoring, nuclear medicine has been able to establish itself as a distinct imaging modality with increased sensitivity and specificity.

AUTHORS: Seyed Ali Mirshahvalad, Adriano B Dias, Sangeet Ghai, Claudia Ortega, Nathan Perlis, Alejandro Berlin, Lisa Avery, Theodorus van der Kwast, Ur Metser, Patrick Veit-Haibach

JOURNAL: Academic radiology

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Rationale and objectives: To determine the role of dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI-radiomics in predicting the International Society of Urological Pathology Grade Group (ISUP-GG) in therapy-naïve prostate cancer (PCa) patients.

Materials and methods: In this ethics review board-approved retrospective study on two prospective clinical trials between 2017 and 2020, 73 men with suspected/confirmed PCa were included. All participants underwent multiparametric MRI. On MRI, dominant lesions (per PI-RADS) were identified. DCE-MRI radiomic features were extracted from the segmented volumes following the image biomarker standardisation initiative (IBSI) guidelines through 14 time points. Histopathology evaluation on the cognitive-fusion targeted biopsies was set as the reference standard. Univariate regression was done to evaluate potential predictors across all calculated features. Random forest imputation was used for multivariate modelling.

Results: 73 index lesions were reviewed. Histopathology revealed 28, 16, 13 and 16 lesions with ISUP-GG-Negative/1/2, ISUP-GG-3, ISUP-GG-4 and ISUP-GG-5, respectively. From the extracted features, total lesion enhancement (TLE), minimum enhancement intensity and Grey-Level Run Length Matrix (GLRLM) were the most significantly different parameters among ISUP-GGs (Neg/1/2 vs 3/4 vs 5). 16 features with significant cross-sectional associations with ISUP-GGs entered the multivariate analysis. The final DCE partitioning model used only four features (lesion sphericity, TLE, GLRLM and Grey-Level Zone Length Matrix). For the binarized diagnosis (ISUP-GG≤2 vs ISUP-GG>2), the accuracy reached 81%.

Conclusion: DCE-MRI radiomics might be used as a non-invasive tool for aiding pathological grade group prediction in therapy-naïve PCa patients, potentially adding complementary information to PI-RADS for supporting tailored diagnostic pathways and treatment planning.

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: The aim of this work is to investigate the feasibility of the Jagiellonian Positron Emission Tomography (J-PET) scanner for intra-treatment proton beam range monitoring.

Methods: The Monte Carlo simulation studies with GATE and PET image reconstruction with CASToR were performed in order to compare six J-PET scanner geometries. We simulated proton irradiation of a PMMA phantom with a Single Pencil Beam (SPB) and Spread-Out Bragg Peak (SOBP) of various ranges. The sensitivity and precision of each scanner were calculated, and considering the setup's cost-effectiveness, we indicated potentially optimal geometries for the J-PET scanner prototype dedicated to the proton beam range assessment.

Results: The investigations indicate that the double-layer cylindrical and triple-layer double-head configurations are the most promising for clinical application. We found that the scanner sensitivity is of the order of 10-5coincidences per primary proton, while the precision of the range assessment for both SPB and SOBP irradiation plans was found below 1 mm. Among the scanners with the same number of detector modules, the best results are found for the triple-layer dual-head geometry. The results indicate that the double-layer cylindrical and triple-layer double-head configurations are the most promising for the clinical application, CONCLUSIONS:: We performed simulation studies demonstrating that the feasibility of the J-PET detector for PET-based proton beam therapy range monitoring is possible with reasonable sensitivity and precision enabling its pre-clinical tests in the clinical proton therapy environment. Considering the sensitivity, precision and cost-effectiveness, the double-layer cylindrical and triple-layer dual-head J-PET geometry configurations seem promising for future clinical application.

TITLE: Application of three-dimensional multi-imaging combination in brachytherapy of cervical cancer

AUTHORS: Zhaoming Zhang, Ning Zhang, Guanghui Cheng

JOURNAL: La Radiologia medica

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Background: Three-dimensional (3D) imaging has an important role in brachytherapy and the treatment of cervical cancer. The main imaging methods used in the cervical cancer brachytherapy include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computer tomography (CT), ultrasound (US), and positron emission tomography (PET). However, single-imaging methods have certain limitations compared to multi-imaging. The application of multi-imaging can make up for the shortcomings and provide a more suitable imaging selection for brachytherapy.

Purpose: This review details the situation and scope of existing multi-imaging combination methods in cervical cancer brachytherapy and provides a reference for medical institutions.

Materials and methods: Searched the literature related to application of three-dimensional multi-imaging combination in brachytherapy of cervical cancer in PubMed/Medline and Web of Science electronic databases. Summarized the existing combined imaging methods and the application of each method in cervical cancer brachytherapy.

Conclusion: The current imaging combination methods mainly include MRI/CT, US/CT, MRI/US, and MRI/PET. The combination of two imaging tools can be used for applicator implantation guidance, applicator reconstruction, target and organs at risk (OAR) contouring, dose optimization, prognosis evaluation, etc., which provides a more suitable imaging choice for brachytherapy.

AUTHORS: Martin Lyngby Lassen, Evangelos Tzolos, Daniele Massera, Sebastien Cadet, Rong Bing, Jacek Kwiecinski, Damini Dey, Daniel S Berman, Marc R Dweck, David E Newby, Piotr J Slomka

JOURNAL: EJNMMI physics

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Background: Current18F-NaF assessments of aortic valve microcalcification using18F-NaF PET/CT are based on evaluations of end-diastolic or cardiac motion-corrected (ECG-MC) images, which are affected by both patient and respiratory motion. We aimed to test the impact of employing a triple motion correction technique (3 × MC), including cardiorespiratory and gross patient motion, on quantitative and qualitative measurements.

Materials and methods: Fourteen patients with aortic stenosis underwent two repeat 30-min PET aortic valve scans within (29 ± 24) days. We considered three different image reconstruction protocols; an end-diastolic reconstruction protocol (standard) utilizing 25% of the acquired data, an ECG-gated (four ECG gates) reconstruction (ECG-MC), and a triple motion-corrected (3 × MC) dataset which corrects for both cardiorespiratory and patient motion. All datasets were compared to aortic valve calcification scores (AVCS), using the Agatston method, obtained from CT scans using correlation plots. We report SUVmaxvalues measured in the aortic valve and maximum target-to-background ratios (TBRmax) values after correcting for blood pool activity.

Results: Compared to standard and ECG-MC reconstructions, increases in both SUVmaxand TBRmaxwere observed following 3 × MC (SUVmax: Standard = 2.8 ± 0.7, ECG-MC = 2.6 ± 0.6, and 3 × MC = 3.3 ± 0.9; TBRmax: Standard = 2.7 ± 0.7, ECG-MC = 2.5 ± 0.6, and 3 × MC = 3.3 ± 1.2, all p values ≤ 0.05). 3 × MC had improved correlations (R2value) to the AVCS when compared to the standard methods (SUVmax: Standard = 0.10, ECG-MC = 0.10, and 3 × MC = 0.20; TBRmax: Standard = 0.20, ECG-MC = 0.28, and 3 × MC = 0.46).

Conclusion: 3 × MC improves the correlation between the AVCS and SUVmaxand TBRmaxand should be considered in PET studies of aortic valves using18F-NaF.

TITLE: CT ventilation images produced by a 3D neural network show improvement over the Jacobian and HU DIR-based methods to predict quantized lung function

AUTHORS: Daryl Wilding-McBride, Jeremy Lim, Hilary Byrne, Ricky O'Brien

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Background: Radiation-induced pneumonitis affects up to 33% of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, with fatal pneumonitis occurring in 2% of patients. Pneumonitis risk is related to the dose and volume of lung irradiated. Clinical radiotherapy plans assume lungs are functionally homogeneous, but evidence suggests that avoidance of high-functioning lung during radiotherapy can reduce the risk of radiation-induced pneumonitis. Radiotherapy avoidance structures can be constructed based on high-function regions indicated in a ventilation map, which can be produced from CT images.

Purpose: Existing methods of deriving such a CT ventilation image (CTVI) require the use of deformable image registration (DIR) of peak-inhale and -exhale CT images, which is susceptible to inaccuracy for small or low-intensity regions, and sensitive to image artefacts. To overcome these problems, we use a neural network to predict a ventilation map from breath-hold CT (BHCT).

Methods: We used the nnU-Net pipeline to train five-fold cross-validated ensemble models to predict a ventilation map (CTVInnU-Net). The training data were comprised of registered BHCT and Galligas PET images from 20 patients. Three training sets were created to ensure performance was averaged over different test patients. For each set, images from two randomly selected test patients were set aside, and models were trained on the remaining images. The ground truth was established by quantizing the Galligas PET images, assigning each voxel a label of high-function (>70th percentile of intensity), medium-function (between 30th and 70th percentile), or low-function (<30th percentile). For comparison, we created a CTVI with a 2D U-Net (CTVInnU-Net-2D), and with the Jacobian (CTVIJac) and Hounsfield Units (CTVIHU) DIR-based methods which we quantized and labeled in the same way. The Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and Hausdorff Distance 95th percentile (HD95) of each CTVI with the ground truth were measured separately for each lung function subregion.

Results: CTVInnU-Nethad the highest similarity to the quantized Galligas PET with a mean (range) DSC over all three categories of lung function at 0.68 (0.56 to 0.82), compared with 0.64 (0.47 to 0.75) for CTVInnU-Net-2D, 0.60 (0.38 to 0.73) for CTVIJac, and 0.56 (0.30 to 0.75) for CTVIHU. CTVInnU-Nethad the equal-lowest spatial distance to the quantized Galligas PET averaged over the three categories, with HD95 of 22 mm (9 to 64 mm), compared with 23 mm (9 to 72 mm) for CTVInnU-Net-2D, 22 mm (12 to 63 mm) for CTVIJac, and 26 mm (12 to 58 mm) for CTVIHU.

Conclusion: Our 3D neural network produces a quantized CTVI with higher similarity to the ground truth than the 2D U-Net and DIR-based Jacobian and HU methods. As it produces a quantized CTVI directly, CTVInnU-Netavoids the need for thresholding to identify high-function lung regions. With faster evaluation and improved accuracy, neural networks show promise for the clinical implementation of functional lung avoidance.

TITLE: [Value of PET/CT Combined with CT Three-dimensional Reconstruction in Distinguishing Different Pathological Subtypes of Early Lung Adenocarcinoma]

AUTHORS: Jie You, Guozhong Zhang, Xianglong Gao, Yong Chen, Yusheng Shu

JOURNAL: Zhongguo fei ai za zhi = Chinese journal of lung cancer

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Background: The good prognosis of lepidic predominant invasive adenocarcinoma (LPA) and adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS)/microinvasive adenocarcinoma (MIA) in the pathological subtypes of early lung adenocarcinoma is similar, and the means to distinguish LPA from non-LPA is urgently needed in clinical practice. This study intends to analyze the correlation between positron emission computed tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) maximal standard uptake value (SUVmax) with CT three-dimensional reconstruction parameters and the pathological subtypes of early lung adenocarcinoma with part-solid nodules (PSNs) in preoperative imaging.

Methods: The data of early lung adenocarcinoma patients who underwent anatomical pneumonectomy at the Department of Thoracic Surgery of Northern Jiangsu People's Hospital from January 2016 to January 2019 retrospectively analyzed and subsolid nodules on imaging were showed. All patients with enhanced chest CT and PET/CT data can be obtained completely, using Mimics software to perform three-dimensional reconstruction to obtain tumor volume, 3-dimensional mean-CT value (3Dm-CT) of tumor and SUVmax, using SPSS 25.0 for statistical analysis and GraphPad Prism 8.3.0 for drawing receiver operating curve (ROC). P<0.05 indicates that the difference is statistically significant.

Results: 67 patients were included in this study. All patients were divided into two groups according to different pathological subtypes. AIS, MIA and LPA in invasive adenocarcinoma (IAC) were in the low-risk group, 28 cases (41.8%), and the remaining non-LPA were in high-risk group, 39 cases (58.2%). SUVmax (t=3.153, P=0.002), tumor volume (t=3.331, P=0.001), solid/ground glass component volume (t=2.74, P=0.006)/(t=3.127, P=0.002) and 3Dm-CT of solid/ground glass component (t=3.655, P<0.001)/(t=7.082, P<0.001) between the two groups were all statistically significant. ROC curve prompts: SUVmax [area under curve (AUC)=0.727], tumor volume (AUC=0.740), ground glass component volume (AUC=0.725), 3Dm-CT of solid components (AUC=0.763), 3Dm-CT of ground glass components (AUC=0.756) have the best predictive performance. The above-mentioned covariates with AUC>0.7 were included in the multivariate ROC curve analysis, and the joint predictor (AUC=0.835) was obtained with medium or above predictive value.

Conclusions: PET/CT SUVmax and CT three-dimensional reconstruction parameters have a significant correlation with the different pathological subtypes of early lung adenocarcinoma with PSNs in imaging. The combination of SUVmax, tumor volume, ground glass component volume and 3Dm-CT of solid/ground glass component CT value has certain value in identifying the pathological subtype of early stage lung adenocarcinoma with PSNs nodules in imaging.

TITLE: Feasibility of in vivo small animal imaging using a clinical total-body PET/CT system

AUTHORS: Julia G Mannheim, Wenhong Lan, Maurizio Conti, Franziska Siedler, Marcel A Krueger, Kristina Herfert, Christian la Fougère, Fabian P Schmidt

JOURNAL: EJNMMI physics

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Background: Clinical PET scanners have long been explored for preclinical imaging, but limited spatial resolution and sensitivity have restricted their use for preclinical studies. The recent availability of total-body (TB) PET/CT scanners with extended axial fields of view (FOVs) has largely overcome sensitivity limitations, enabling potential new opportunities for small-animal imaging. This study evaluated the feasibility and performance of the Biograph Vision Quadra TB-PET/CT for rodent imaging compared to the dedicated small-animal PET scanner Inveon DPET.

Material and methods: Recovery coefficients (RC), image noise, and optimum image reconstruction parameters were assessed using the preclinical NEMA NU 4-2008 image quality phantom and a sub-cohort of three anesthetized mice as a proof-of-concept demonstrating the feasibility of the setup. In vivo quantification accuracy was evaluated by scanning nine frozen mice simultaneously in three different arrangements with the Quadra compared with individual scans at the Inveon. To ensure comparability, all mice were snap-frozen after 1 h uptake of [1⁸F]FDG, scanned sequentially and individually at the Inveon (90 min p.i.), and subsequently scanned at the Quadra with decay-corrected acquisition times. SUVmeanand SUVmaxvalues were determined for liver, muscle and brain regions on both systems. To evaluate potential position-dependent effects within the extended axial FOV, a single frozen mouse was scanned at multiple positions.

Results: Phantom rods ≥ 2 mm could be resolved with the Quadra, showing a comparable RC for larger structures, e.g. for the 5 mm rod of 1.17 compared to 1.09 (Inveon) when using point-spread-function modeling, whilst having lower noise of 5.1%SD vs 9.0%SD. No substantial position-dependent effects were detected in the phantom or single-mouse scan across the axial FOV. SUVmeanvalues were consistent between both scanner across all investigated organs, with liver and muscle uptake remaining comparable for frame durations down to 5 s. SUVmaxvalues exhibited greater variability, with significant differences observed in muscle and brain regions.

Conclusion: Despite the lower spatial resolution of the clinical TB-PET/CT scanner (~ 3-4 mm) compared to the dedicated preclinical scanner (~ 1.5 mm), robust SUVmeanquantification was achievable. Together with successful in vivo imaging of anesthetized mice, these findings support the feasibility of using clinical TB-PET/CT for preclinical research, acknowledging spatial resolution as a limiting factor.

JOURNAL: Cancer letters

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
The recurrence rate of soft tissue and bone sarcomas strongly correlates to the status of the surgical margin after excision, yet excessive removal of tissue may lead to distinct, otherwise avoidable morbidity. Therefore, adequate margination of sarcomas both pre- and intra-operatively is a clinical necessity that has not yet fully been met. Current guidance for soft-tissue sarcomas recommends an ultrasound scan followed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). For bone sarcomas, two plane radiographs are required, followed similarly by an MRI scan. The introduction of more precise imaging modalities may reduce the morbidity associated with sarcoma surgery; the PET-CT and PET-MRI approaches in particular demonstrating high clinical efficacy. Despite advancements in the accuracy in pre-operative imaging, translation of an image to surgical margins is difficult, regularly resulting in wider resection margins than required. For soft tissue sarcomas there is currently no standard technique for image guided resections, while for bone sarcomas fluoroscopy may be used, however margins are not easily discernible during the surgical procedure. Near infra-red (NIR) fluorescence guided surgery offers an intra-operative modality through which complete tumour resection with adequate tumour-free margins may be achieved, while simultaneously minimising surgical morbidity. NIR imaging presents a potentially valuable adjunct to sarcoma surgery. Early reports indicate that it may be able to provide the surgeon with helpful information on anatomy, perfusion, lymphatic drainage, tumour margins and metastases. The use of NIR fluorochromes have also been demonstrated to be well tolerated by patients. However, prior to widespread implementation, studies related to cost-effectiveness and the development of protocols are essential. Nevertheless, NIR imaging may become ubiquitous in the future, carrying the potential to transform the surgical management of sarcoma.

AUTHORS: Takahiro Ando, Tetsuro Sekine, Yasuo Murai, Erika Orita, Ryo Takagi, Yasuo Amano, Kotomi Iwata, Masatoki Nakaza, Masashi Ogawa, Makoto Obara, Shin-Ichiro Kumita

JOURNAL: Neuroradiology

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: MRI-based risk stratification should be established to identify patients with internal carotid artery stenosis (ICS) who require further PET or SPECT evaluation. This study assessed whether multiparametric flow analysis using time-resolved 3D phase-contrast (4D flow) MRI can detect cerebral hemodynamic impairment in patients with ICS.

Methods: This retrospective study analyzed 26 consecutive patients with unilateral ICS (21 men; mean age, 71 years) who underwent 4D flow MRI and acetazolamide-stress brain perfusion SPECT. Collateral flow via the Willis ring was visually evaluated. Temporal mean flow volume rate (Net), pulsatile flow volume (ΔV), and pulsatility index (PI) at the middle cerebral artery were measured. Cerebral vascular reserve (CVR) was calculated from the SPECT dataset. Patients were assigned to the misery perfusion group if the CVR was < 10% and to the nonmisery perfusion group if the CVR was ≥ 10%. Parameters showing a significant difference in both groups were statistically evaluated.

Results: Affected side ΔV, ratio of affected to contralateral side Net (rNet), and ratio of affected to contralateral side ΔV were significantly correlated to CVR (p = 0.030, p = 0.010, p = 0.015, respectively). Absence of retrograde flow at the posterior communicating artery was observed in the misery perfusion group (p = 0.020). Combined cut-off values of the affected side ΔV (0.18 ml) and rNet (0.64) showed a sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 77.8%, respectively.

Conclusion: Multiparametric flow analysis using 4D flow MRI can detect misery perfusion by comprehensively assessing blood flow data, including blood flow volume, pulsation, and collateral flow.

TITLE: Three-dimensional amide proton transfer (APT) imaging appliable to navigation surgery can present comparable metabolic activity of glioblastoma to 11C-Methionine PET

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Background: Amide proton transfer (APT) imaging has been proposed as a technique to assess tumor metabolic activity. We have previously11C-methionine positron emission tomography (11C-Met-PET) can evaluate the metabolic activity of peritumoral area including infiltrating tumor cells in glioblastoma (GBM). To resolve disadvantages of11C-Met-PET, in the present study, we aimed to evaluate whether three-dimensional fast spin echo-based APT (3D FSE-APT) imaging is usable for not only presenting the metabolic activity of brain tumors, but also detecting areas where infiltrating tumor cells including glioma stem cells (GSCs) could exist, by applying an image-guided navigation system incorporating 3D FSE-APT to glioblastoma surgery.

Methods: Twenty-six consecutive patients with GBMs were enrolled in this study. Among these 26 cases, 10 patients underwent11C-Met-PET examination. All 26 patients underwent two-dimensional single shot fast spine echo-based APT acquisition with a chemical exchange saturation transfer sequence (2D SSFSE-APT). The most recent 14 cases underwent 3D FSE-APT to examine whether 3D APT imaging was applicable to the navigation system. We investigated the clinical applicability of 3D FSE-APT by comparison with 2D SSFSE-APT and evaluated the utility of 3D FSE-APT as a metabolic imaging guide in the intraoperative navigation system. We also analyzed whether 3D FSE-APT can depict the extent of infiltrating tumor cells including GSCs in the peritumoral area in GBM.

Results: The most recent 14 cases underwent 3D FSE-APT. The 3D FSE-APT was visually almost equivalent to 2D SSFSE-APT and mean APT intensity (APTmean) in GBM obtained by 3D FSE-APT was almost equal to that from 2D SSFSE-APT. Mean APTmeanon 2D SSFSE-APT at the site showing a tumor-to-contralateral normal brain tissue ratio (TNR) of 1.4 on11C-Met-PET was 1.52 ± 0.16%. In contrast, mean APTmeanon 3D FSE-APT at the same site was 1.30 ± 0.06%. The optimal cut-off value for APTmeanon 3D FSE-APT was evaluated as 1.28%, offering 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity. Incorporating 3D FSE-APT into the navigation system allowed tumor resection including infiltrating tumor cells under image-guided navigation. Mean Ki-67 staining index in the area with a mean APTmeanof 1.28% was 11.8% (range, 5.0-20.0%).

Conclusions: The area of tumor invasion could be evaluated by 3D FSE-APT in a similar way to11C-Met-PET, and the cut-off value for deciding the borderline between the area including infiltrating tumor cells and that with almost no tumor cells was 12.8%. In addition, 3D FSE-APT could be applied to navigation systems and may have great potential as an imaging modality replacing11C-Met-PET in GBM surgery.

ABSTRACT:
BACKGROUND. Accurate nodal staging is essential to guide treatment selection in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). To our knowledge, measurement of electron density (ED) using dual-energy CT (DECT) is unexplored for this purpose.OBJECTIVE. The purpose of our study was to assess the utility of ED from DECT in diagnosing metastatic mediastinal lymph nodes in patients with NSCLC in comparison with conventional CT and FDG PET/CT.METHODS. This retrospective study included 57 patients (36 men, 21 women; mean age, 68.4 ± 8.9 [SD] years) with NSCLC and surgically resected mediastinal lymph nodes who underwent preoperative DECT and FDG PET/CT. The patients had a total of 117 resected mediastinal lymph nodes (33 metastatic, 84 nonmetastatic). Two radiologists independently reviewed the morphologic features of nodes on the 120-kVp images and also measured the iodine concentration (IC) and ED of nodes using maps generated from DECT data; consensus was reached for discrepancies. Two different radiologists assessed FDG PET/CT examinations in consensus for positive node uptake. Diagnostic performance was evaluated for individual and pairwise combinations of features.RESULTS. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for nodal metastasis were 15.2%, 98.8%, and 75.2% for the presence of necrosis, respectively; 54.5%, 85.7%, and 76.9% for short-axis diameter greater than 8.5 mm; 63.6%, 73.8%, and 70.9% for long-axis diameter greater than 13.0 mm; 51.5%, 79.8%, and 71.8% for attenuation on 120-kVp images of 95.8 HU or less; 87.9%, 58.3%, and 66.7% for ED of 3.48 × 1023/cm3or less; and 66.7%, 75.0%, and 72.6% for positive FDG uptake. Among pairwise combinations of features, accuracy was highest for the combination of ED and short-axis diameter (accuracy, 82.9%; sensitivity, 54.5%; specificity, 94.0%) and the combination of ED and positive FDG uptake (accuracy, 82.1%; sensitivity, 60.6%; specificity, 90.5%); these accuracies were greater than those for the individual features (p< .05). The remaining combinations exhibited accuracies ranging from 74.4% to 77.8%. Interobserver agreement analysis showed an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.90 for ED. IC was not significantly different between metastatic and nonmetastatic nodes (p= .18) and was excluded from the diagnostic performance analysis.CONCLUSION. ED derived from DECT may help diagnose metastatic lymph nodes in NSCLC given decreased ED in metastatic nodes.CLINICAL IMPACT. ED may complement conventional CT findings and FDG uptake on PET/CT in diagnosing metastatic nodes.

TITLE: A 3D Convolutional Neural Network Based on Non-enhanced Brain CT to Identify Patients with Brain Metastases

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Dedicated brain imaging for cancer patients is seldom recommended in the absence of symptoms. There is increasing availability of non-enhanced CT (NE-CT) of the brain, mainly owing to a wider utilization of Positron Emission Tomography-CT (PET-CT) in cancer staging. Brain metastases (BM) are often hard to diagnose on NE-CT. This work aims to develop a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (3D-CNN) based on brain NE-CT to distinguish patients with and without BM. We retrospectively included NE-CT scans for 100 patients with single or multiple BM and 100 patients without brain imaging abnormalities. Patients whose largest lesion was < 5 mm were excluded. The largest tumor was manually segmented on a matched contrast-enhanced T1 weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), and shape radiomics were extracted to determine the size and volume of the lesion. The brain was automatically segmented, and masked images were normalized and resampled. The dataset was split into training (70%) and validation (30%) sets. Multiple versions of a 3D-CNN were developed, and the best model was selected based on accuracy (ACC) on the validation set. The median largest tumor Maximum-3D-Diameter was 2.29 cm, and its median volume was 2.81 cc. Solitary BM were found in 27% of the patients, while 49% had > 5 BMs. The best model consisted of 4 convolutional layers with 3D average pooling layers, dropout layers of 50%, and a sigmoid activation function. Mean validation ACC was 0.983 (SD: 0.020) and mean area under receiver-operating characteristic curve was 0.983 (SD: 0.023). Sensitivity was 0.983 (SD: 0.020). We developed an accurate 3D-CNN based on brain NE-CT to differentiate between patients with and without BM. The model merits further external validation.

TITLE: Machine learning based oxygen and carbon concentration derivation using dual-energy CT for PET-based dose verification in proton therapy

AUTHORS: Yuxiang Liu, Long Zhou, Hao Peng

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Online dose verification based on proton-induced positron emitters requires high accuracy in the assignment of elemental composition (e.g., C and O). We developed a machine learning framework for deriving oxygen and carbon concentration based on dual-energy CT (DECT).

Methods: Digital phantoms at the head site were constructed based on single-energy CT (SECT) and stoichiometric calibration. DECT images (80 and 140 kVp) were synthesized using two methods: (1) theoretical CT numbers with Gaussian noise (method 1) and (2) forward/backward image reconstruction with poly-energetic energy spectrum and Poisson noise modeled (method 2). Two architectures of convolutional neural networks, UNet and ResNet, were investigated to map from DECT images to C/O weights. Four cases (UNet-1: Method 1+UNet, ResNet-1: Method 1+ResNet, UNet-2: Method 2+UNet, and ResNet-2: Method 2 +ResNet) were tested for different tissue types and different noise levels. Monte-Carlo simulation was employed to identify the impact of fluctuation in oxygen and carbon concentration on activity/dose distribution.

Results: When no noise is present, all four cases are able to obtain <2% mean absolute errors and <4% root mean square error (RMSE). For the worst image quality (e.g., lowest image SNR), the RMSE for O among all tissue types is 3.02% (UNet-1), 4.46% (ResNet-1), 4.38% (UNet-2), and 6.31% (ResNet-2), respectively. For UNet-1 and ResNet-1, the model performed slightly better in terms of RMSE for skeletal tissue than soft tissues. Such a trend is not observed for UNet-2 and ResNet-2. With regard to the comparison between UNet and ResNet, different accuracy and noise immunity are observed. The activity profiles exhibit 3%-5% difference in terms of mean relative error between the ground truth and machine learning outcome.

Conclusion: We explored the feasibility of a machine learning framework to derive elemental concentration of oxygen and carbon based on DECT images. Two machine learning models, UNet and ResNet, are able to utilize spatial correlation and obtain accurate carbon and oxygen concentration. This study lays a foundation for us to apply the proposed approach to clinical DECT images.

TITLE: Validation of a computational chain from PET Monte Carlo simulations to reconstructed images

AUTHORS: Philip Kalaitzidis, Johan Gustafsson, Cecilia Hindorf, Michael Ljungberg

JOURNAL: Heliyon

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
The study aimed to create a pipeline from Monte Carlo simulated projections of a Gate PET system to reconstructed images. The PET system was modelled after the GE Discovery MI (DMI) PET/CT, and the simulated projections were reconstructed with the stand-alone reconstruction software CASToR. Attenuation correction, normalisation calibration, random estimation, and scatter estimation for the simulations were computed with in-house programs. The pipeline was compared in both projection and image space with data acquired on a clinical DMI and reconstructed with GE's off-line PET reconstruction software (PET Toolbox) and CASToR. The simulated and measured data were compared for the number of prompt coincidences, scatter fraction, contrast recovery coefficient (CRC), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), background variability, residual lung error, and image profiles. A slight discrepancy was noted in the projection space, but good agreements were generally achieved in image space between simulated and measured data. The CRC was found to be 81 % for Gate - CASToR, 84 % for GE - CASToR, and 84 % for GE - PET Toolbox for the largest sphere of the NEMA image quality (IQ) phantom, and the SNR was found to be 98 for Gate - CASToR, 91 for GE - CASToR, and 93 for GE - PET Toolbox. Profiles drawn over the spheres for the NEMA IQ phantom and the Data Spectrum (DS) phantom show a good match between measurement and simulation. The results indicate feasibility to utilise the pipeline as a tool for off-line simulation-based studies. A complete pipeline introduces possibilities to study the impact of single parameters in the whole chain from simulation to reconstructed images.

AUTHORS: Zhanglei Ouyang, Shujun Zhao, Zhaoping Cheng, Yanhua Duan, Zixiang Chen, Na Zhang, Dong Liang, Zhanli Hu

JOURNAL: Frontiers in computational neuroscience

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Purpose:This study aims to explore the impact of adding texture features in dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) reconstruction of imaging results.Methods:We have improved a reconstruction method that combines radiological dual texture features. In this method, multiple short time frames are added to obtain composite frames, and the image reconstructed by composite frames is used as the prior image. We extract texture features from prior images by using the gray level-gradient cooccurrence matrix (GGCM) and gray-level run length matrix (GLRLM). The prior information contains the intensity of the prior image, the inverse difference moment of the GGCM and the long-run low gray-level emphasis of the GLRLM.Results:The computer simulation results show that, compared with the traditional maximum likelihood, the proposed method obtains a higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the image obtained by dynamic PET reconstruction. Compared with similar methods, the proposed algorithm has a better normalized mean squared error (NMSE) and contrast recovery coefficient (CRC) at the tumor in the reconstructed image. Simulation studies on clinical patient images show that this method is also more accurate for reconstructing high-uptake lesions.Conclusion:By adding texture features to dynamic PET reconstruction, the reconstructed images are more accurate at the tumor.

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Introduction: To implement the use of CT iterative reconstruction, instead of standard FBP, in order to reduce the patient dose of the 18F-FDG PET/CT examinations, preserving image quality and SUV accuracy.

Methods: Catphan 600 and Alderson-Rando anthropomorphic phantom were used to evaluate the SAFIRE iterative CT reconstruction on Siemens Biograph mCT system, progressively reducing theCareDose4D Quality-Ref-mAs. The PET quantitative accuracy was also evaluated by NEMA2012 IQ phantom. The optimized CT reconstruction protocol was applied in clinical setting on additional segmental PET/CT scan, after standard whole body PET/CT, for qualitative evaluation by two nuclear medicine physicians.

Results: Measurements on Cathpan phantom demonstrated thatSafire reconstruction level 3 allowed to reduce the CT dose of about 40% without worsening the noise and CNR. For mAs-modulated acquisitions on the anthropomorphic phantom, a 30% reduction of doseusingSafire at level 3does not worsen image quality in any anatomical part. Analysing PET/CT acquisitions of NEMA IQ phantom with standard CT FBP reconstruction vs dose-optimized CT iterative reconstruction, the SUV values showed very small deviations (<0.6 %). The clinical evaluation carried out on 25 patients demonstrates the non-inferiority of the image quality obtained with the reduced CT dose and Safire 3 iterative reconstruction protocol compared to the reference CT dose and FBP reconstruction.

Conclusions: The use of the Safire iterative reconstruction at level 3 in whole-body PET/CT acquisition allowed an effective dose reduction of 1.8 mSv in mean (from 10.1 mSv to 8.3 mSv, p < 0.001), without any detriment of image quality and SUV accuracy.

TITLE: A multi-scale pyramid residual weight network for medical image fusion

AUTHORS: Yiwei Liu, Shaoze Zhang, Yao Tang, Xihai Zhao, Zuo-Xiang He

JOURNAL: Quantitative imaging in medicine and surgery

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Background: Due to the inherent limitations of imaging sensors, acquiring medical images that simultaneously provide functional metabolic information and detailed structural organization remains a significant challenge. Multi-modal image fusion has emerged as a critical technology for clinical diagnosis and surgical navigation, as it enables the integration of complementary information from different imaging modalities. However, existing deep learning (DL)-based fusion methods often face difficulties in effectively combining high-frequency detail information with low-frequency contextual information, which frequently leads to the degradation of high-frequency details. Therefore, there is a pressing need for a method that addresses these challenges, preserving both high- and low-frequency information while maintaining clear structural contours. In response to this issue, a novel convolutional neural network (CNN), named the multi-scale pyramid residual weight network (LYWNet), is proposed. The objective of this approach is to improve the fusion process by effectively integrating high- and low-frequency information, thereby enhancing the quality and accuracy of multimodal image fusion. This method aims to overcome the limitations of current fusion techniques and ensure the preservation of both functional and structural details, ultimately contributing to more precise clinical diagnoses and better surgical navigation outcomes.

Methods: We propose a novel CNN, LYWNet, designed to address these challenges. LYWNet is composed of three modules: (I) data preprocessing module: utilizes three convolutional layers to extract both deep and shallow features from the input images. (II) Feature extraction module: incorporates three identical multi-scale pyramid residual weight (LYW) blocks in series, each featuring three interactive branches to preserve high-frequency detail information effectively. (III) Image reconstruction module: utilizes a fusion algorithm based on feature distillation to ensure the effective integration of functional and anatomical information. The proposed image fusion algorithm enhances the interaction of contextual cues and retains the metabolic details from functional images while preserving texture details from anatomical images.

Results: The proposed LYWNet demonstrated its ability to retain high-frequency details during feature extraction, effectively combining them with low-frequency contextual information. The fusion results exhibited reduced differences between the fused image and the original images. The structural similarity (SSIM) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) were 0.5592±0.0536 and 17.3594±1.0211, respectively, for single-photon emission computed tomography-magnetic resonance imaging (SPECT-MRI), 0.5195±0.0730 and 14.5324±1.7365 for PET-MRI; 0.5376±0.0442 and 13.9202±0.7265 for magnetic resonance imaging-computed tomography.

Conclusions: LYWNet excels at integrating high-frequency detail information and low-frequency contextual information, addressing the deficiencies of existing DL-based image fusion methods. This approach provides superior fused images that retain the functional metabolic information and anatomical texture, making it a valuable tool for clinical diagnosis and surgical navigation.

TITLE: Imaging findings of immune checkpoint inhibitor associated pancreatitis

AUTHORS: Jeeban P Das, Michael A Postow, Claire F Friedman, Richard K Do, Darragh F Halpenny

JOURNAL: European journal of radiology

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: To describe contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT), 18-Fluorine (18F)-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) associated pancreatitis in patients undergoing immunotherapy for solid malignant tumours.

Method: In this retrospective study, 25 patients with clinical and/or biochemical evidence of pancreatitis who underwent CECT, MRI and18F-FDG-PET/CT while being treated with ICIs were included. Imaging features of acute pancreatitis included: pancreatic enlargement, heterogeneous enhancement, peripancreatic stranding, fluid collection, pseudocyst, necrosis, atrophy and calcification.18F-FDG PET/CT imaging was reviewed for pattern of abnormally increased pancreatic FDG uptake. ICI-associated pancreatitis diagnosis was based on clinical, imaging and biochemical findings.

Results: Imaging findings of ICI-associated pancreatitis included diffuse (n = 14) or focal (n = 11) pancreatic enlargement; heterogenous enhancement (n = 21); focal (n = 9) or diffuse (n = 15) peripancreatic infiltration on CECT and MRI. A pattern consistent with acute interstitial pancreatitis was present in 20/25 (80 %) patients, and a pattern consistent with autoimmune pancreatitis in 4/25 (16 %). A mixed pattern was present in one patient (4%). No patient developed necrotizing pancreatitis or a pseudocyst. The CT severity index was < 3 in all patients, consistent with mild pancreatitis. Focal pancreatic FDG uptake was noted in 2/3 (66 %) of patients. Acute imaging findings resolved with treatment in all 25 patients. Pancreatic atrophy developed in 11/25 (44 %).

Conclusions: ICI-associated pancreatitis typically presents as either focal or diffuse acute interstitial pancreatitis. Post-pancreatitis atrophy is common. The ICI-associated pancreatitis cases in our study were mild, managed conservatively and did not result in local acute complications.

TITLE: Evaluation of Reconstruction Algorithms to Validate the NEMA Phantom Results in Clinical Scenario - A Comparative Study Using Time-of-Flight versus Non-Time-of-Flight Positron Emission Tomography Imaging

AUTHORS: Ajay Kumar, Pearl Jacob, Ankit Watts, Anwin Joseph, Harneet Kaur, Monika Hooda, Amritjyot Kaur, Baljinder Singh

JOURNAL: Indian journal of nuclear medicine : IJNM : the official journal of the Society of Nuclear Medicine, India

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Objectives: The objective is to standardize the reconstruction parameters for the time-of-flight (TOF)versusnon-TOF positron-emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging data and validation of the same in a clinical setting.

Methods: The four spheres (10.0/13.0/17.0/22.0 mm) of the PET phantom (NEMA IQ Nu 2-2001) were filled with four times higher activity of [18F]-NaF than the background (5.3kBq/mL). Imaging (image matrix - 128 × 128 × 47, 2 min, 3D model) was done using two different (TOF/non-TOF) PET scanners. Phantom data were reconstructed in TOF and non-TOF modes for lutetium-yttrium oxyorthosilicate and non-TOF mode for bismuth germanate-based PET scanners. The reconstructed data (by varying iteration and subsets) that provided the best image contrast and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) were evaluated. The whole-body [18F]-fludeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/CT scans (7-8 frames; 2.0 min/frame) in 16 lymphoma patients were acquired at 60 min after injecting the radioactivity (370.0-444.0 MBq of [18F]-FDG. The clinical PET/CT data were reconstructed using phantom-derived reconstruction parameters and evaluated for image contrast and SNR of the detected lesions.

Results: TOF reconstruction at second iteration provided significantly (P≤ 0.02) higher SNR (20.7) and contrast (contrast recovery coefficient/background variability = 3.21) for the smallest hot lesions (10.0 mm) in the phantom than the non-TOF system. Similarly, in patient data analysis for the selected FDG avid lesions, the SNR values were significantly (P= 0.02) higher (13.3 ± 6.49) in TOF than (11 ± 6.48) in non-TOF system. Further, the small (≤10.0 mm) lesions were seen more distinctly in TOF system.

Conclusion: It is thus observed that TOF reconstruction converged faster than the non-TOF, and the applicability of the same may impact the image quality and interpretation in the clinical PET data. The validation of the phantom-based experimental reconstruction parameters to clinical PET imaging data is highly warranted.

JOURNAL: Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Introduction: Understanding the neurometabolic changes associated with amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition is important for early Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis, but their spatial relationships remained unexplored due to technical limitations.

Methods: We investigated the relationship between Aβ deposition and neuronal and glial metabolites using high-resolution 3D magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) (8-min scan, 2 × 3 × 3 mm3resolution) and Aβ-positron emission tomography (Aβ-PET) imaging. N-acetylaspartate, myo-inositol, and creatine maps were obtained from 174 participants: 39 controls, 65 mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 70 AD patients.

Results: N-Acetylaspartate levels were negatively correlated with Aβ, while myo-inositol levels were positively correlated globally. Regional associations with Aβ include N-acetylaspartate reductions in frontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and precuneus, and myo-inositol increases in precuneus, lateral temporal, and lateral parietal cortices. Combined MRSI and PET biomarkers achieved the highest diagnostic accuracy for MCI and AD .

Discussion: Hybrid high-resolution 3D MRSI and Aβ-PET imaging provides valuable insights into Aβ's impact on neurometabolic changes, improving early AD diagnosis.

Highlights: Hybrid 3D magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging-positron emission tomography (MRSI-PET) imaging reveals Aβ deposition impact on neurometabolism in Alzheimer's disease (AD). N-acetylaspartate (NAA) as a neuronal metabolic marker is negatively associated with Aβ globally and locally. Myo-inositol (mI) as a glial metabolic marker is positively associated with Aβ globally and locally. Combining 3D magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) and PET biomarkers improves diagnostic accuracy for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD.

AUTHORS: Sun-Jin Kim, Myeong-Lok Seol, Byun-Young Chung, Dae-Sic Jang, Jong-Hwan Kim, Young-Chul Choi

JOURNAL: Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Self-powered wireless sensor systems have emerged as an important topic for condition monitoring in nuclear power plants. However, commercial wireless sensor systems still cannot be fully self-sustainable due to the high power consumption caused by excessive signal processing in a mini-electronic computing system. In this sense, it is essential not only to integrate the sensor system with energy-harvesting devices but also to develop simple data processing methods for low power schemes. In this paper, we report a patch-type vibration visualization (PVV) sensor system based on the triboelectric effect and a visualization technique for self-sustainable operation. The PVV sensor system composed of a polyethylene terephthalate (PET)/Al/LCD screen directly converts the triboelectric signal into an informative black pattern on the LCD screen without excessive signal processing, enabling extremely low power operation. In addition, a proposed image processing method reconverts the black patterns to frequency and acceleration values through a remote-control camera. With these simple signal-to-pattern conversion and pattern-to-data reconversion techniques, a vibration visualization sensor network has successfully been demonstrated.

JOURNAL: Journal of clinical medicine

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of death, accounting for over 30% of annual global fatalities. Ischemic heart disease, in turn, is a frontrunner of worldwide CVD mortality. With the burden of coronary disease rapidly growing, understanding the nuances of cardiac imaging and risk prognostication becomes paramount. Myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) is a frequently utilized and well established testing modality due to its significant clinical impact in disease diagnosis and risk assessment. Recently, nuclear cardiology has witnessed major advancements, driven by innovations in novel imaging technologies and improved understanding of cardiovascular pathophysiology. Applications of artificial intelligence (AI) to MPI have enhanced diagnostic accuracy, risk stratification, and therapeutic decision-making in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). AI techniques such as machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) neural networks offer new interpretations of immense data fields, acquired through cardiovascular imaging modalities such as nuclear medicine (NM). Recently, AI algorithms have been employed to enhance image reconstruction, reduce noise, and assist in the interpretation of complex datasets. The rise of AI in nuclear medicine (AI-NM) has proven itself groundbreaking in the efficiency of image acquisition, post-processing time, diagnostic ability, consistency, and even in risk-stratification and outcome prognostication. To that end, this narrative review will explore these latest advances in AI in nuclear medicine and its rapid transformation of the cardiac diagnostics landscape. This paper will examine the evolution of AI-NM, review novel AI techniques and applications in nuclear cardiac imaging, summarize recent AI-NM clinical trials, and explore the technical and clinical challenges in its implementation of artificial intelligence.

JOURNAL: Frontiers in medicine

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Purpose:The aim of this study was to assess image quality and lesion detectability acquired with a digital Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (PET/CT) Siemens Biograph Vision 600 system.Material and Methods:Consecutive patients who underwent a FDG PET/CT during the first week of use of a digital PET/CT (Siemens Biograph Vision 600) at the nuclear medicine department of the university hospital of Brest were analyzed. PET were realized using list mode acquisition. For all patients, 4 datasets were reconstructed. We determined, according to phantom measurements, an equivalent time acquisition/reconstruction parameters pair of the digital PET/CT corresponding to an analog PET/CT image quality ("analog-like") as reference dataset. We compared the reference dataset with 3 others digital PET/CT reconstruction parameters, allowing a decrease of emission duration: 60, 90, and 120 s per bed position. Three nuclear medicine physicians evaluated independently, for each dataset, overall image quality [Maximal Intensity Projection (MIP), noise, sharpness] using a 4-point scale. Physicians assessed also lesion detection capability by reporting new visible lesions on each digital datasets with their confidence level in comparison with analog-like dataset.Results:Ninety-eight patients were analyzed. Image quality of MIP (IQMIP), sharpness (IQSHARPNESS), and noise (IQNOISE) of all digital datasets (60, 90, and 120 s) were better than those evaluated with analog-like reconstruction. Moreover, digital PET/CT system improved IQMIP, IQNOISE, and IQSHARPNESSwhatever the BMI. Lesion detection capability and confidence level were higher for 60, 90, 120 s per bed position, respectively, than for analog-like images.Conclusion:Our study demonstrated an improvement of image quality and lesion detectability with a digital PET/CT system.

TITLE: Neural MLAA for PET-enabled Dual-Energy CT Imaging

JOURNAL: Proceedings of SPIE--the International Society for Optical Engineering

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
The PET-enabled dual-energy CT method allows dual-energy CT imaging on PET/CT scanners without the need for a second x-ray CT scan. A 511 keV γ-ray attenuation image can be reconstructed from time-of-flight PET emission data using the maximum-likelihood attenuation and activity (MLAA) algorithm. However, the attenuation image reconstructed by standard MLAA is commonly noisy. To suppress noise, we propose a neural-network approach for MLAA reconstruction. The PET attenuation image is described as a function of kernelized neural networks with the flexibility of incorporating the available x-ray CT image as anatomical prior. By applying optimization transfer, the complex optimization problem of the proposed neural MLAA reconstruction is solved by a modularized iterative algorithm with each iteration decomposed into three steps: PET activity image update, attenuation image update, and neural-network learning using a weighed mean squared-error loss. The optimization algorithm is guaranteed to monotonically increase the data likelihood. The results from computer simulations demonstrated the neural MLAA algorithm can achieve a significant improvement on the γ-ray CT image quality as compared to other algorithms.

TITLE: Joint estimation of activity, attenuation and motion in respiratory-self-gated time-of-flight PET

ABSTRACT:
Whole-body PET imaging is often hindered by respiratory motion during acquisition, causing significant degradation in the quality of reconstructed activity images. An additional challenge in PET/CT imaging arises from the respiratory phase mismatch between CT-based attenuation correction and PET acquisition, leading to attenuation artifacts. To address these issues, we propose two new, purely data-driven methods for the joint estimation of activity, attenuation, and motion in respiratory self-gated TOF PET. These methods enable the reconstruction of a single activity image free from motion and attenuation artifacts. The proposed methods were evaluated using data from the anthropomorphic Wilhelm phantom acquired on a Siemens mCT PET/CT system, as well as 3 clinical FDG PET/CT datasets acquired on a GE DMI PET/CT system. Image quality was assessed visually to identify motion and attenuation artifacts. Lesion uptake values were quantitatively compared across reconstructions without motion modeling, with motion modeling but static attenuation correction, and with our proposed methods. For the Wilhelm phantom, the proposed methods delivered image quality closely matching the reference reconstruction from a static acquisition. The lesion-to-background contrast for a liver dome lesion improved from 2.0 (no motion correction) to 5.2 (proposed methods), matching the contrast from the static acquisition (5.2). In contrast, motion modeling with static attenuation correction yielded a lower contrast of 3.5. In patient datasets, the proposed methods successfully reduced motion artifacts in lung and liver lesions and mitigated attenuation artifacts, demonstrating superior lesion to background separation. Our proposed methods enable the reconstruction of a single, high-quality activity image that is motion-corrected and free from attenuation artifacts, without the need for external hardware.

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Background:The purpose of this study was to develop a rapid, reliable, and efficient tool for three-dimensional (3D) dosimetry treatment planning and post-treatment evaluation of liver radioembolization with90Y microspheres, using tissue-specific dose voxel kernels (DVKs) that can be used in everyday clinical practice.Materials and Methods:Two tissue-specific DVKs for90Y were calculated through Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. DVKs for the liver and lungs were generated, and the dose distribution was compared with direct MC simulations. A method was developed to produce a 3D dose map by convolving the calculated DVKs with the activity biodistribution derived from clinical single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) or positron emission tomography (PET) images. Image registration for the SPECT or PET images with the corresponding computed tomography scans was performed before dosimetry calculation. The authors first compared the DVK convolution dosimetry with a direct full MC simulation on an XCAT anthropomorphic phantom. They then tested it in 25 individual clinical cases of patients who underwent90Y therapy. All MC simulations were carried out using the GATE MC toolkit.Results:Comparison of the measured absorbed dose using tissue-specific DVKs and direct MC simulation on 25 patients revealed a mean difference of 1.07% ± 1.43% for the liver and 1.03% ± 1.21% for the tumor tissue, respectively. The largest difference between DVK convolution and full MC dosimetry was observed for the lung tissue (10.16% ± 1.20%). The DVK statistical uncertainty was <0.75% for both media.Conclusions:This semiautomatic algorithm is capable of performing rapid, accurate, and efficient 3D dosimetry. The proposed method considers tissue and activity heterogeneity using tissue-specific DVKs. Furthermore, this method provides results in <1 min, making it suitable for everyday clinical practice.

TITLE: Development of quantitative PET/MR imaging for measurements of hepatic portal vein input function: a phantom study

AUTHORS: Zacharias Chalampalakis, Markus Ortner, Masar Almuttairi, Martin Bauer, Ernesto Gomez Tamm, Albrecht Ingo Schmidt, Barbara Katharina Geist, Marcus Hacker, Oliver Langer, Roberta Frass-Kriegl, Ivo Rausch

JOURNAL: EJNMMI physics

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Background: Accurate pharmacokinetic modelling in PET necessitates measurements of an input function, which ideally is acquired non-invasively from image data. For hepatic pharmacokinetic modelling two input functions need to be considered, to account for the blood supply from the hepatic artery and portal vein. Image-derived measurements at the portal vein are challenging due to its small size and image artifacts caused by respiratory motion. In this work we seek to demonstrate, using phantom experiments, how a dedicated PET/MR protocol can tackle these challenges and potentially provide input function measurements of the portal vein in a clinical setup.

Methods: A custom 3D printed PET/MR phantom was constructed to mimic the liver and portal vein. PET/MR acquisitions were made with emulated respiratory motion. The PET/MR imaging protocol consisted of high-resolution anatomical MR imaging of the portal vein, followed by a PET acquisition in parallel to a dedicated motion-tracking MR sequence. Motion tracking and deformation information were extracted from PET data and subsequently used in PET reconstruction to produce dynamic series of motion-free PET images. Anatomical MR images were used post PET reconstruction for partial volume correction of the input function measurements.

Results: Reconstruction of dynamic PET data with motion-compensation provided nearly motion-free series of PET frame data, suitable for image derived input function measurements of the portal vein. After partial volume correction, the individual input function measurements were within a 16.1% error range from the true activity in the portal vein compartment at the time of PET acquisition.

Conclusion: The proposed protocol demonstrates clinically feasible PET/MR imaging of the liver for pharmacokinetic studies with accurate quantification of the portal vein input function, including correction for respiratory motion and partial volume effects.

ABSTRACT:
Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) has proven an effective tool for the treatment of brain tumors, arteriovenous malformation, and functional conditions. However, radiation-induced therapeutic effect in viable cells in functional SRS is also suggested. Evaluation of the proposed modulatory effect of irradiation on neuronal activity without causing cellular death requires the knowledge of radiation dose tolerance at very small tissue volume. Therefore, we aimed to establish a porcine model to study the effects of ultra-high radiosurgical doses in small volumes of the brain. Five minipigs received focal stereotactic radiosurgery with single large doses of 40-100 Gy to 5-7.5 mm fields in the left primary motor cortex and the right subcortical white matter, and one animal remained as unirradiated control. The animals were followed-up with serial MRI, PET scans, and histology 6 months post-radiation. We observed a dose-dependent relation of the histological and MRI changes at 6 months post-radiation. The necrotic lesions were seen in the grey matter at 100 Gy and in white matter at 60 Gy. Furthermore, small volume radiosurgery at different dose levels induced vascular, as well as neuronal cell changes and glial cell remodeling.

TITLE: A proper protocol for routine 18F-FDG uEXPLORER total-body PET/CT scans

AUTHORS: Huiran Hu, Yanchao Huang, Hongyan Sun, Kemin Zhou, Li Jiang, Jinmei Zhong, Li Chen, Lijuan Wang, Yanjiang Han, Hubing Wu

JOURNAL: EJNMMI physics

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Background: Conventional clinical PET scanners typically have an axial field of view (AFOV) of 15-30 cm, resulting in limited coverage and relatively low photon detection efficiency. Taking advantage of the development of long-axial PET/CT, the uEXPLORER PET/CT scanner with an axial coverage of 194 cm increases the effective count rate by approximately 40 times compared to that of conventional PET scanners. Ordered subset expectation maximization (OSEM) is the most widely used iterative algorithm in PET. The major drawback of OSEM is that the iteration process must be stopped before convergence to avoid image degradation due to excessive noise. A new Bayesian penalized-likelihood iterative PET reconstruction, named HYPER iterative, was developed and is now available on the uEXPLORER total-body PET/CT, which incorporates a noise control component by using a penalty function in each iteration and finds the maximum likelihood solution through repeated iterations. To date, its impact on lesion visibility in patients with a full injected dose or half injected dose is unclear. The goal of this study was to determine a proper protocol for routine18F-FDG uEXPLORER total-body PET/CT scans.

Results: The uEXPLORER total-body PET/CT images reconstructed using both OSEM and HYPER iterative algorithms of 20 tumour patients were retrospectively reviewed. The quality of the 5 min PET image was excellent (score 5) for all of the dose and reconstruction methods. Using the HYPER iterative method, the PET images reached excellent quality at 1 min with full-dose PET and at 2 min with half-dose PET. The PET image reached a similar excellent quality at 2 min with a full dose and at 3 min with a half dose using OSEM. The noise in the OSEM reconstruction was higher than that in the HYPER iterative. Compared to OSEM, the HYPER iterative had a slightly higher SUVmax and TBR of the lesions for large positive lesions (≥ 2 cm) (SUVmax: up to 9.03% higher in full dose and up to 12.52% higher in half dose; TBR: up to 8.69% higher in full dose and up to 23.39% higher in half dose). For small positive lesions (≤ 10 mm), the HYPER iterative had an obviously higher SUVmax and TBR of the lesions (SUVmax: up to 45.21% higher in full dose and up to 74.96% higher in half dose; TBR: up to 44.91% higher in full dose and up to 93.73% higher in half dose).

Conclusions: A 1 min scan with a full dose and a 2 min scan with a half dose are optimal for clinical diagnosis using the HYPER iterative and 2 min and 3 min for OSEM. For quantification of the small lesions, HYPER iterative reconstruction is preferred.

TITLE: Noise-assisted hybrid attention networks for low-dose PET and CT denoising

AUTHORS: Hengzhi Xue, Yudong Yao, Yueyang Teng

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Background: Positron emission tomography (PET) and computed tomography (CT) play a vital role in tumor-related medical diagnosis, assessment, and treatment planning. However, full-dose PET and CT pose the risk of excessive radiation exposure to patients, whereas low-dose images compromise image quality, impacting subsequent tumor recognition and disease diagnosis.

Purpose: To solve such problems, we propose a Noise-Assisted Hybrid Attention Network (NAHANet) to reconstruct full-dose PET and CT images from low-dose PET (LDPET) and CT (LDCT) images to reduce patient radiation risks while ensuring the performance of subsequent tumor recognition.

Methods: NAHANet contains two branches: the noise feature prediction branch (NFPB) and the cascaded reconstruction branch. Among them, NFPB providing noise features for the cascade reconstruction branch. The cascaded reconstruction branch comprises a shallow feature extraction module and a reconstruction module which contains a series of cascaded noise feature fusion blocks (NFFBs). Among these, the NFFB fuses the features extracted from low-dose images with the noise features obtained by NFPB to improve the feature extraction capability. To validate the effectiveness of the NAHANet method, we performed experiments using two public available datasets: the Ultra-low Dose PET Imaging Challenge dataset and Low Dose CT Grand Challenge dataset.

Results: As a result, the proposed NAHANet achieved higher performance on common indicators. For example, on the CT dataset, the PSNR and SSIM indicators were improved by 4.1 dB and 0.06 respectively, and the rMSE indicator was reduced by 5.46 compared with the LDCT; on the PET dataset, the PSNR and SSIM was improved by 3.37 dB and 0.02, and the rMSE was reduced by 9.04 compared with the LDPET.

Conclusions: This paper proposes a transformer-based denoising algorithm, which utilizes hybrid attention to extract high-level features of low dose images and fuses noise features to optimize the denoising performance of the network, achieving good performance improvements on low-dose CT and PET datasets.

TITLE: Skene's Gland Adenocarcinoma: Borrowing From Prostate Cancer Experience for the Evaluation and Management of a Rare Malignancy

AUTHORS: Matthew E Kaufman, Devin T Miller, Asad Ullah, Joseph White, Gurmukh Singh, Ravindra Kolhe, Hadyn Williams, Pardeep Mittal, Jigarkumar Parikh, Martha K Terris

JOURNAL: Urology

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Objective: To determine if adenocarcinoma of the Skene's glands in women, which has a histological and immunohistochemical appearance similar to prostate cancer, can be evaluated and managed with the same tools we use for prostate cancer.

Methods: Serum prostate-specific antigen kinetics, 3D multiparametric (MP) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), fluciclovine F-18 positron emission tomography (PET), and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) were employed in a case of Skene's gland adenocarcinoma.

Results: The 3D MP MRI clarified the anatomy of the primary lesion and fluciclovine F-18 PET significantly improved our ability to stage the tumor prompting pelvic lymph node dissection that may have otherwise not been performed. ADT resulted in a significant impact on prostate-specific antigen kinetics despite the patient having a testosterone level in the normal range for a postmenopausal woman.

Conclusion: Despite the rarity of Skene's gland adenocarcinoma, we can employ many of the tools at our disposal for the evaluation and management of prostate cancer to benefit the women found to have this malignancy.

TITLE: One-View Time-of-Flight Positron Emission Tomography Reconstruction

AUTHORS: Gengsheng L Zeng, Qiu Huang

JOURNAL: IEEE transactions on radiation and plasma medical sciences

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
The time-of-flight (TOF) information makes Orlov's condition not necessary for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. One-view imaging has never been attempted before. This paper investigates whether one-view imaging is possible. We claim that it is possible to obtain an image with measurements from only one-view, provided the TOF time resolution is good enough and the photon counts are high enough. In fact, the image value at a point can be reconstructed by measurements along one line-of-response (LOR) that passes through the point of interest. The region-of-interest (ROI) can be reconstructed with ray-by-ray deblurring methods, which make TOF PET a local tomography system. One-view imaging is a severely ill-posed problem if the TOF resolution is not good enough. One indicator of an ill-posed problem is the ringing artifacts in the reconstruction. We show that ringing artifacts can be eliminated by using the nonnegativity constraint for the dot-like objects with a zero background.

TITLE: 3D-OSEM versus FORE + OSEM: Optimal Reconstruction Algorithm for FDG PET with a Short Acquisition Time

AUTHORS: Keisuke Tsuda, Takayuki Suzuki, Kazuhito Toya, Eisuke Sato, Hirofumi Fujii

JOURNAL: World journal of nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
ObjectiveIn this study, we investigated the optimal reconstruction algorithm in fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) with a short acquisition time.Materials and MethodsIn the phantom study, six spheres filled with FDG solution (sphere size: 6.23-37 mm; radioactivity ratio of spheres to background = 8:1) and placed in a National Electrical Manufacturers Association phantom were evaluated. Image acquisition time was 15 to 180 seconds, and the obtained image data were reconstructed using each of the Fourier rebinning (FORE) + ordered subsets expectation-maximization (OSEM) and 3D-OSEM algorithms. In the clinical study, mid-abdominal images of 19 patients were evaluated using regions of interest placed on areas of low, intermediate, and high radioactivity. All obtained images were investigated visually, and quantitatively using maximum standardized uptake value (SUV) and coefficient of variation (CV).ResultsIn the phantom study, FORE + OSEM images with a short acquisition time had large CVs (poor image quality) but comparatively constant maximum SUVs. 3D-OSEM images showed comparatively constant CVs (good image quality) but significantly low maximum SUVs. The results of visual evaluation were well correlated with those of quantitative evaluation. Small spheres were obscured on 3D-OSEM images with short acquisition time, but image quality was not greatly deteriorated. The clinical and phantom studies yielded similar results.ConclusionFDG PET images with a short acquisition time reconstructed by FORE + OSEM showed poorer image quality than by 3D-OSEM. However, images obtained with a short acquisition time and reconstructed with FORE + OSEM showed clearer FDG uptake and more useful than 3D-OSEM in the light of the detection of lesions.

JOURNAL: Diagnostics (Basel, Switzerland)

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: To evaluate the impact of different metal artifact reduction algorithms on Hounsfield units (HU) and the standardized uptake value (SUV) in normal organs in patients with different metal implants.

Methods: This study prospectively included 66 patients (mean age of 66.02 ± 13.1 years) with 87 different metal implants. CT image reconstructions were performed using weighted filtered back projection (WFBP) as the standard method, metal artifact reduction in image space (MARIS), and an iterative metal artifacts reduction (iMAR) algorithm for large implants. These datasets were used for PET attenuation correction. HU and SUV measurements were performed in nine predefined anatomical locations: liver, lower lung lobes, descending aorta, thoracic vertebral body, autochthonous back muscles, pectoral muscles, and internal jugular vein. Differences between HU and SUV measurements were compared using pairedt-tests. The significance level was determined asp= 0.017 using Bonferroni correction.

Results: No significant differences were observed between reconstructed images using iMAR and WFBP concerning HU and SUV measurements in liver (HU:p= 0.055; SUVmax:p= 0.586), lung (HU:p= 0.276; SUVmax:p= 1.0 for the right side and HU:p= 0.630; SUVmax:p= 0.109 for the left side), descending aorta (HU:p= 0.333; SUVmax:p= 0.083), thoracic vertebral body (HU:p= 0.725; SUVmax:p= 0.392), autochthonous back muscles (HU:p= 0.281; SUVmax:p= 0.839), pectoral muscles (HU:p= 0.481; SUVmax:p= 0.277 for the right side and HU:p= 0.313; SUVmax:p= 0.859 for the left side), or the internal jugular vein (HU:p= 0.343; SUVmax:p= 0.194).

Conclusion: Metal artifact reduction algorithms such as iMAR do not alter the data information of normal organs not affected by artifacts.

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear cardiology : official publication of the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Introduction: The prevalence of defects and effective radiation dose from various myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) strategies in congenital heart disease (CHD) is unknown.

Methods: We studied 75 subjects with complex CHD (ages 5 to 80 years) referred for MPI between 2002 and 2015. A rest and exercise or pharmacologic stress MPI was performed using99mTechnetium sestamibi,82rubidium or13N-ammonia, and Sodium iodide SPECT (single-photon emission computed tomography), SPECT/CT or Cadmium zinc telluride (CZT) SPECT or PET (positron emission tomography)/CT scanners. Deidentified images were interpreted semi-quantitatively in three batches: stress only MPI, stress/rest MPI, and stress/rest MPI with taking into account a history of ventricular septal defect repair. Effective radiation dose was estimated for stress/rest MPI and predicted for 1-day stress-first (normal stress scans), and for 2-day stress/rest MPI (abnormal stress scans).

Results: The median age was 18.6 years. The most common type of CHD was transposition of the great arteries (63%). Rest/stress MPI was abnormal in 43% of subjects and 25% of the abnormal scans demonstrated reversible defects. Of the subjects with abnormal MPI, 33% had significant underlying anatomic coronary artery obstruction. Estimated mean effective radiation dose ranged from 2.1 ± 0.6 mSv for13N-ammonia PET/CT to 12.5 ± 0.9 mSv for SPECT/CT. Predicted effective radiation dose was significantly lower for stress-first MPI and for 2-day stress/rest protocols.

Conclusions: Due to the relatively high prevalence of abnormal stress MPI, tailored protocols with a stress-first MPI as well as the use of 2-day protocols and advanced imaging technologies including CZT SPECT, novel image reconstruction software, and PET MPI could substantially reduce radiation dose in complex CHD.

TITLE: Phantom and clinical evaluation of the Bayesian penalised likelihood reconstruction algorithm Q.Clear without PSF correction in amyloid PET images

JOURNAL: EJNMMI physics

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Bayesian penalised likelihood (BPL) reconstruction, which incorporates point-spread-function (PSF) correction, provides higher signal-to-noise ratios and more accurate quantitation than conventional ordered subset expectation maximization (OSEM) reconstruction. However, applying PSF correction to brain PET imaging is controversial due to Gibbs artefacts that manifest as unpredicted cortical uptake enhancement. The present study aimed to validate whether BPL without PSF would be useful for amyloid PET imaging.

Methods: Images were acquired from Hoffman 3D brain and cylindrical phantoms for phantom study and 71 patients administered with [18F]flutemetamol in clinical study using a Discovery MI. All images were reconstructed using OSEM, BPL with PSF correction, and BPL without PSF correction. Count profile, %contrast, recovery coefficients (RCs), and image noise were calculated from the images acquired from the phantoms. Amyloid β deposition in patients was visually assessed by two physicians and quantified based on the standardised uptake value ratio (SUVR).

Results: The overestimated radioactivity in profile curves was eliminated using BPL without PSF correction. The %contrast and image noise decreased with increasing β values in phantom images. Image quality and RCs were better using BPL with, than without PSF correction or OSEM. An optimal β value of 600 was determined for BPL without PSF correction. Visual evaluation almost agreed perfectly (κ = 0.91-0.97), without depending on reconstruction methods. Composite SUVRs did not significantly differ between reconstruction methods.

Conclusion: Gibbs artefacts disappeared from phantom images using the BPL without PSF correction. Visual and quantitative evaluation of [18F]flutemetamol imaging was independent of the reconstruction method. The BPL without PSF correction could be the standard reconstruction method for amyloid PET imaging, despite being qualitatively inferior to BPL with PSF correction for [18F]flutemetamol amyloid PET imaging.

TITLE: Coronary artery calcium burden, carotid atherosclerotic plaque burden, and myocardial blood flow in patients with end-stage renal disease: A non-invasive imaging study combining PET/CT and 3D ultrasound

AUTHORS: Christian Wenning, Alexis Vrachimis, Hermann-Joseph Pavenstädt, Stefan Reuter, Michael Schäfers

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear cardiology : official publication of the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Background: Imaging-based measures of atherosclerosis such as coronary artery calcium score (CACS) and coronary flow reserve (CFR) as well as carotid atherosclerotic plaque burden (cPB) are predictors of cardiovascular events in the general population. The objective of this study was to correlate CACS, cPB, myocardial blood flow (MBF), and CFR in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD).

Methods and results: 39 patients (mean age 53 ± 12 years) with ESRD prior to kidney transplantation were enrolled. MBF and CFR were quantified at baseline and under hyperemia by13N-NH3-PET/CT. CACS was calculated from low-dose CT scans acquired for PET attenuation correction. cPB was assessed by 3D ultrasound. Uni- and multivariate regression analyses between these and clinical parameters were performed. Median follow-up time for clinical events was 4.4 years. Kaplan-Meier survival estimates with log-rank test were performed with regards to cardiovascular (CV) events and death of any cause. CACS and cPB were associated in ESRD patients (r = 0.48; p ≤ 0.01). While cPB correlated with age (r = 0.43; p < 0.01), CACS did not. MBFstresswas negatively associated with age (r = 0.44; p < 0.01) and time on dialysis (r = 0.42; p < 0.01). There were negative correlations between MBFstressand CACS (r = - 0.62; p < 0.001) and between MBFstressand cPB (r = - 0.43; p < 0.01). Age and CACS were the strongest predictors for MBFstress. CFR was impaired (< 2.0) in eight patients who also presented with higher cPB and higher CACS compared to those with a CFR > 2.0 (p = 0.06 and p = 0.4). In contrast to MBFstress, there was neither a significant correlation between CFR and CACS (r = - 0.2; p = 0.91) nor between CFR and cPB (r = - 0.1; p = 0.55). CV event-free survival was associated with reduced CFR and MBFstress(p = 0.001 and p < 0.001) but not with cPB or CACS.

Conclusions: CACS, cPB, and MBFstressare associated in patients with ESRD. Atherosclerosis is earlier detected by MBFstressthan by CFR. CV event-free survival is associated with impaired CFR and MBFstress.

TITLE: Head-to-head comparison of a Si-photomultiplier-based and a conventional photomultiplier-based PET-CT system

AUTHORS: Jenny Oddstig, Gustav Brolin, Elin Trägårdh, David Minarik

JOURNAL: EJNMMI physics

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Background: A novel generation of PET scanners based on silicon (Si)-photomultiplier (PM) technology has recently been introduced. Concurrently, there has been development of new reconstruction methods aimed at increasing the detectability of small lesions without increasing image noise. The combination of new detector technologies and new reconstruction algorithms has been found to increase image quality. However, it is unknown to what extent the demonstrated improvement of image quality is due to scanner hardware development or improved reconstruction algorithms. To isolate the contribution of the hardware, this study aimed to compare the ability to detect small hotspots in phantoms using the latest generation SiPM-based PET/CT scanner (GE Discovery MI) relative to conventional PM-based PET/CT scanner (GE Discovery 690), using identical reconstruction protocols.

Materials and methods: Two different phantoms (NEMA body and Jasczcak) with fillable spheres (31 μl to 26.5 ml) and varying sphere-to-background-ratios (SBR) were scanned in one bed position for 15-600 s on both scanners. The data were reconstructed using identical reconstruction parameters on both scanners. The recovery-coefficient (RC), noise level, contrast (spherepeak/backgroundpeak-value), and detectability of each sphere were calculated and compared between the scanners at each acquisition time.

Results: The RC-curves for the NEMA phantom were near-identical for both scanners at SBR 10:1. For smaller spheres in the Jaszczak phantom, the contrast was 1.22 higher for the DMI scanner at SBR 15:1. The ratio decreased for lower SBR, with a ratio of 1.03 at SBR 3.85:1. Regarding the detectability of spheres, the sensitivity was 98% and 88% for the DMI and D690, respectively, for SBR 15:1. For SBR 7.5, the sensitivity was 75% and 83% for the DMI and D690, respectively. For SBR 3.85:1, the sensitivity was 43% and 30% for the DMI and D690, respectively.

Conclusion: Marginally higher contrast in small spheres was seen for the SiPM-based scanner but there was no significant difference in detectability between the scanners. It was difficult to detect differences between the scanners, suggesting that the SiPM-based detectors are not the primary reason for improved image quality.

TITLE: Radiomics model of 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging for predicting disease-free survival of early-stage uterine cervical squamous cancer

AUTHORS: Shuai Liu, Ruikun Li, Qiufang Liu, Dazheng Sun, Hongxing Yang, Herong Pan, Lisheng Wang, Shaoli Song

JOURNAL: Cancer biomarkers : section A of Disease markers

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Background: To explore an effective predictive model based on PET/CT radiomics for the prognosis of early-stage uterine cervical squamous cancer.

Methods: Preoperative PET/CT data were collected from 201 uterine cervical squamous cancer patients with stage IB-IIA disease (FIGO 2009) who underwent radical surgery between 2010 and 2015. The tumor regions were manually segmented, and 1318 radiomic features were extracted. First, model-based univariate analysis was performed to exclude features with small correlations. Then, the redundant features were further removed by feature collinearity. Finally, the random survival forest (RSF) was used to assess feature importance for multivariate analysis. The prognostic models were established based on RSF, and their predictive performances were measured by the C-index and the time-dependent cumulative/dynamics AUC (C/D AUC).

Results: In total, 6 radiomic features (5 for CT and 1 for PET) and 6 clinicopathologic features were selected. The radiomic, clinicopathologic and combination prognostic models yielded C-indexes of 0.9338, 0.9019 and 0.9527, and the mean values of the C/D AUC (mC/D AUC) were 0.9146, 0.8645 and 0.9199, respectively.

Conclusions: PET/CT radiomics could achieve approval power in predicting DFS in early-stage uterine cervical squamous cancer.

TITLE: Optimization of BMI-Based Images for Overweight and Obese Patients - Implications on Image Quality, Quantification, and Radiation Dose in Whole Body 18F-FDG PET/CT Imaging

AUTHORS: Yassine Bouchareb, Naima Tag, Hajir Sulaiman, Khulood Al-Riyami, Zabah Jawa, Humoud Al-Dhuhli

JOURNAL: Nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: In PET/CT imaging, the activity of the18F-FDG activity is injected either based on patient body weight (BW) or body mass index (BMI). The purpose of this study was to optimise BMI-based whole body18F-FDG PET images obtained from overweight and obese patients and assess their image quality, quantitative value and radiation dose in comparison to BW-based images.

Methods: The NEMA-IEC-body phantom was scanned using the mCT 128-slice scanner. The spheres and background were filed with F-18 activity. Spheres-to-background ratio was 4:1. Data was reconstructed using the OSEM-TOF-PSF routine reconstruction. The optimization was performed by varying number of iterations and subsets, filter's size and type, and matrix size. The optimized reconstruction was applied to 17 patients' datasets. The optimized BMI-, routine BMI- and the BW-based images were compared visually and using contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and standardized uptake values (SUV) measurements.

Results: The visual assessment of the optimized phantom images showed better image quality and contrast-recovery-coefficients (CRCs) values compared to the routine reconstruction. Using patient data, the optimized BMI-based images provided better image quality compared to BW-based images in 87.5% of the overweight cases and 66.7% for obese cases. The optimized BMI-based images resulted in more than 50% reduction of radiation dose. No significant differences were found between the three series of images in SUV measurements.

Conclusion: The optimized BMI-based approach using 1 iteration, 21 subsets, and 3 mm Hamming filter improves image quality, reduces radiation dose, and provides, at least, similar quantification compared to the BW-based approach for overweight and obese patients.

ABSTRACT:
Background: Total variation regularized expectation maximization (TVREM) reconstruction algorithm on the image quality of gallium (68GA) prostate-specific membrane antigen-11 ([68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11) total-body positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT).

Methods: Images of a phantom with small hot sphere inserts and the total-body PET/CT scans of 51 prostate cancer patients undergoing [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 were reconstructed using TVREM with 5 different penalization factors between 0.09 and 0.45 and for 20-, 40-, 60-, 120-, and 300-second acquisition, respectively. As a comparison, the same data were also reconstructed using the ordered subset expectation maximization (OSEM) with 3 iterations, 20 subsets, and 300 second acquisition. The contrast recovery coefficients (CRC) and background variability (BV) of the phantom, the tumor-to-background ratios (TBR), the contrast recovery (CR) ratio, the image noise of the liver, and maximum standard uptake value (SUVmax) of the lesions were calculated to evaluate the image quality. The clinical performance of the images was evaluated by 2 radiologists with a 5-point scale (1-poor, 5-excellent).

Results: The TVREM reconstructions groups fwith 120 second acquisition and the penalization of 0.27 to 0.45 showed the best performance in terms of CR, TBR, image noise, and the gain of SUVmaxcompared to that obtained in the OSEM 300 second group. Even the image noise of the TVREM 120 second group with a penalization factor of 0.27 and 0.36 was comparable to the OSEM 300 second group; the lesions' SUVmaxincreased by 28% whereas the image noise decreased by 5% and 14%, respectively. The TVREM 120 second group with a penalization factor of 0.36 (5.00±0.00) had the highest qualitative score that equaled OSEM and TVREM for the 300 second (P>0.05) group.

Conclusions: Our study has shown the potential of the TVREM reconstruction algorithm with optimized penalization factors to achieve comparable [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 total-body PET/CT image quality with a shorter acquisition time, compared with the conventional OSEM reconstruction algorithm.

TITLE: Minimally invasive quantification of cerebral P2X7R occupancy using dynamic [18F]JNJ-64413739 PET and MRA-driven image derived input function

JOURNAL: Scientific reports

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
[18F]JNJ-64413739 has been evaluated as PET-ligand for in vivo quantification of purinergic receptor subtype 7 receptor (P2X7R) using Logan graphical analysis with a metabolite-corrected arterial plasma input function. In the context of a P2X7R PET dose occupancy study, we evaluated a minimally invasive approach by limiting arterial sampling to baseline conditions. Meanwhile, post dose distribution volumes (VT) under blocking conditions were estimated by combining baseline blood to plasma ratios and metabolite fractions with an MR angiography driven image derived input function (IDIF). Regional postdose VT,IDIFvalues were compared with corresponding VT,AIFestimates using a arterial input function (AIF), in terms of absolute values, test-retest reliability and receptor occupancy. Compared to an invasive AIF approach, postdose VT,IDIFvalues and corresponding receptor occupancies showed only limited bias (Bland-Altman analysis: 0.06 ± 0.27 and 3.1% ± 6.4%) while demonstrating a high correlation (Spearman ρ = 0.78 and ρ = 0.98 respectively). In terms of test-retest reliability, regional intraclass correlation coefficients were 0.98 ± 0.02 for VT,IDIFcompared to 0.97 ± 0.01 for VT,AIF.These results confirmed that a postdose IDIF, guided by MR angiography and using baseline blood and metabolite data, can be considered for accurate [18F]JNJ-64413739 PET quantification in a repeated PET study design, thus avoiding multiple invasive arterial sampling and increasing dosing flexibility.

TITLE: Time-synchronized 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose PET/MRI with MR-active trigger and Bayesian penalized likelihood reconstruction: Diagnostic utility for locoregional extension of endometrial cancer

AUTHORS: Miho Tachibana, Munenobu Nogami, Junko Inoue Inukai, Feibi Zeng, Kazuhiro Kubo, Takako Kurimoto, Martin W Huellner, Yoshiko Ueno, Takahiro Tsuboyama, Izumi Imaoka, Takamichi Murakami

JOURNAL: European journal of radiology

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Minimal misregistration of fused PET and MRI images can be achieved with simultaneous positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI). However, the acquisition of multiple MRI sequences during a single PET emission scan may impair fusion precision of each sequence. This study evaluated the diagnostic utility of time-synchronized PET/MRI using an MR active trigger and a Bayesian penalized likelihood reconstruction algorithm (BPL) to assess the locoregional extension of endometrial cancer.

Methods: Fifty-five patients with endometrial cancer who underwent pelvic 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose PET/MRI were retrospectively evaluated. The PET emission time for the BPL reconstruction was determined by the MR active trigger of each MR sequence. The concordance rates of image interpretation with pathological T-staging, diagnostic performance for deep myometrial invasion (MI), and diagnostic confidence levels were evaluated by two readers and compared between time-synchronized, overlapping (conventional and simultaneous, but not time-synchronized), and sequential (not simultaneous) PET/MRI and MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging. Misregistration of the PET/MRI-fused images was determined by evaluating the differences in bladder dimensions.

Results: The T classification by time-synchronized PET/MRI was the most concordant with the pathological T classification for the two readers. Time-synchronized PET/MRI had a significantly higher diagnostic performance for deep MI and higher confidence level scores than overlapping PET/MRI for the novice reader (p = 0.033 and p = 0.038, respectively). The differences in bladder dimension on sequential PET/MRI were significantly larger than those on overlapping and time-synchronized PET/MRI (p <0.001).

Conclusion: Time-synchronized PET/MRI is superior to conventional PET/MRI for assessing the locoregional extension of endometrial cancer.

TITLE: Effect of Tumor-Pixel Positioning on the Variability of SUV Measurements in PET Images

AUTHORS: Koji Itagaki, Katsuhiko Mitsumoto, Masaaki Kajisako, Maki Shioji, Shigeto Kawase

JOURNAL: Asia Oceania journal of nuclear medicine & biology

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect on standardized uptake value (SUV) measurement variability of the positional relationship between objects of different sizes and the pixel of a positron emission tomography (PET) image.

Methods: We used a NEMA IEC body phantom comprising six spheres with diameters of 10, 13, 17, 22, 28, and 37 mm. The phantom was filled with18F solution and contained target-to-background ratios (TBRs) of 2, 4, and 8. The PET data were acquired for 30 min using a SIGNA PET/MR scanner. The PET images were reconstructed with the ordered subsets expectation maximization (OSEM) algorithm with and without point-spread function (PSF) correction (OSEM + PSF + Filter and OSEM + Filter, respectively). A Gaussian filter of 4 mm full width at half maximum was applied in all reconstructions, except for one model (OSEM + PSF + no Filter). The matrix sizes were 128×128, 192×192, 256×256 and 384×384. Reconstruction was performed by shifting the reconstruction center position by 1 mm in the range 0 to 3 mm in the upward or rightward direction for each parameter. For all reconstructed images, the SUVmaxof each hot sphere was measured. To investigate the resulting variation in the SUVmax, the coefficient of variation (CV) of each SUVmaxwas calculated.

Results: The CV of the SUVmaxincreased as the matrix size and the diameter of the hot sphere decreased in all reconstruction settings. With PSF correction, the CV of SUVmaxincreased as the TBR increased except when the TBR was 2. The CV of the SUVmaxmeasured in the OSEM + PSF + no Filter images were larger than those measured in the OSEM + PSF + Filter images. The amount of this increase was higher for smaller spheres and larger matrix sizes and was independent of TBR.

Conclusions: Shifting the reconstruction center position of the PET image causes variability in SUVmaxmeasurements. To reduce the variability of SUV measurements, it is necessary to use sufficient matrix sizes to satisfy sampling criterion and appropriate filters.

JOURNAL: The British journal of radiology

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Objective: A new Bayesian penalized likelihood reconstruction algorithm for positron emission tomography (PET) (Q.Clear) is now in clinical use for fludeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/CT. However, experience with non-FDG tracers and in special patient populations is limited. This pilot study aims to compare Q.Clear to standard PET reconstructions for18F sodium fluoride (18F-NaF) PET in obese patients.

Methods: 30 whole body18F-NaF PET/CT scans (10 patients with BMI 30-40 Kg/m2and 20 patients with BMI >40 Kg/m2) and a NEMA image quality phantom scans were analyzed using ordered subset expectation maximization (OSEM) and Q.Clear reconstructions methods with B400, 600, 800 and 1000. The images were assessed for overall image quality (IQ), noise level, background soft tissue, and lesion detectability, contrast recovery (CR), background variability (BV) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) for both algorithms.

Results: CNR for clinical cases was higher for Q.Clear than OSEM (p< 0.05). Mean CNR for OSEM was (21.62 ± 8.9), and for Q.Clear B400 (31.82 ± 14.6), B600 (35.54 ± 14.9), B800 (39.81 ± 16.1), and B1000 (40.9 ± 17.8). As the β value increased the CNR increased in all clinical cases. B600 was the preferred β value for reconstruction in obese patients. The phantom study showed Q.Clear reconstructions gave lower CR and lower BV than OSEM. The CNR for all spheres was significantly higher for Q.Clear (independent of β) than OSEM (p< 0.05), suggesting superiority of Q.Clear.

Conclusion: This pilot clinical study shows that Q.Clear reconstruction algorithm improves overall IQ of18F-NaF PET in obese patients. Our clinical and phantom measurement results demonstrate improved CNR and reduced BV when using Q.Clear. A β value of 600 is preferred for reconstructing18F-NaF PET/CT with Q.Clear in obese patients.

Advances in knowledge: 18F-NaF PET/CT is less susceptible to artifacts induced by body habitus. Bayesian penalized likelihood reconstruction with18F-NaF PET improves overall IQ in obese patients.

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: To evaluate the diagnostic performance (DP) of the high-resolution contrast computed tomography (HR-contrast-CT) based Neck-Persistency-Net in distinguishing vital from non-vital persistent cervical lymph nodes (pcLNs) in patients with advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) following primary concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT) with [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography and high-resolution contrast-enhanced computed tomography ([18F]FDG-PET-CT). Furthermore, the Neck-Persistency-Net's potential to justify omitting post-CRT neck dissection (ND) without risking treatment delays or preventing unnecessary surgery was explored.

Methods: All HNSCC patients undergoing primary CRT followed by post-CRT-ND for pcLNs recorded in the institutional HNSCC registry were analyzed. The Neck-Persistency-Net DP was explored for three scenarios: balanced performance (BalPerf), optimized sensitivity (OptSens), and optimized specificity (OptSpec). Histopathology of post-CRT-ND served as a reference.

Results: Among 68 included patients, 11 were female and 32 had vital pcLNs. The Neck-Persistency-Net demonstrated good DP with an area under the curve of 0.82. For BalPerf, both sensitivity and specificity were 78%; for OptSens (90%), specificity was 62%; for OptSpec (95%), sensitivity was 54%. Limiting post-CRT-ND to negative results would have delayed treatment in 27%, 40%, and 7% for BalPerf, OptSens and OptSpec, respectively, versus 23% for [18F]FDG-PET-CT. Conversely, restricting post-CRT-ND to positive results would have prevented unnecessary post-CRT-ND in 78%, 60%, and 95% for BalPerf, OptSens and OptSpec, respectively, versus 55% for [18F]FDG-PET-CT.

Conclusion: The DP of the Neck-Persistency-Net was comparable to [18F]-FDG-PET-CT. Depending on the chosen decision boundary, the potential to justify the omission of post-CRT-ND without risking treatment delays in false negative findings or reliably prevent unnecessary surgery in false positive findings outperforms the [18F]-FDG-PET-CT.

JOURNAL: Medical image computing and computer-assisted intervention : MICCAI ... International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention

ABSTRACT:
Head motion correction is an essential component of brain PET imaging, in which even motion of small magnitude can greatly degrade image quality and introduce artifacts. Building upon previous work, we propose a new head motion correction framework taking fast reconstructions as input. The main characteristics of the proposed method are: (i) the adoption of a high-resolution short-frame fast reconstruction workflow; (ii) the development of a novel encoder for PET data representation extraction; and (iii) the implementation of data augmentation techniques. Ablation studies are conducted to assess the individual contributions of each of these design choices. Furthermore, multi-subject studies are conducted on an18F-FPEB dataset, and the method performance is qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated by MOLAR reconstruction study and corresponding brain Region of Interest (ROI) Standard Uptake Values (SUV) evaluation. Additionally, we also compared our method with a conventional intensity-based registration method. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other methods on all subjects, and can accurately estimate motion for subjects out of the training set.

TITLE: Impact of patient size on image quality of OSEM3D and BSREM reconstructions in [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-TATE PET/MR

AUTHORS: Christina P W Cox, Tessa Brabander, Frederik A Verburg, Marcel Segbers

JOURNAL: EJNMMI physics

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Background: Previous [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-TATE PET/CT studies using ordered subset expectation maximization (OSEM3D) based reconstruction algorithms, demonstrated non-linear relations between body weight and image quality. Block Sequential Regularized Expectation Maximization (BSREM) algorithm reduces noise amplification during reconstruction. The impact of the reconstruction algorithm on the relation between image quality and patient size in [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-TATE PET/MR may differ from PET/CT and OSEM3D. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the relation between patient size and image quality in OSEM3D and BSREM [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-TATE PET/MR reconstructions.

Methods: [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-TATE PET/MR images of 55 patients were included. Images were reconstructed using OSEM3D (VUE Point FX SharpIR, 4 iterations, 28 subsets and 7 mm Gaussian filter) and BSREM (Q.Clear, β = 300). Liver signal-to-noise ratio (SNRliver) normalized for injected activity and acquisition time (SNRliver,norm) was measured to perform curve fitting with patient-dependent parameters using fixed, linear and non-linear fit models, followed by Akaike's corrected information criterion (AICc) model selection.

Results: BSREM mean SNRliver was significantly (p < 0.001) higher than OSEM3D mean SNRliver. Body mass, the best patient-dependent parameter for both algorithms, clarified 40% (linear model) and 53% (non-linear model) of the variability in SNRliver,norm for OSEM3D and 20% (linear model) and 21% (non-linear model) for BSREM. AICc preferred a non-linear model for OSEM3D and a linear model for BSREM.

Conclusion: The image quality predictor body weight is a weaker predictor for BSREM than for OSEM3D image quality in [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-TATE PET/MR. Therefore, a linear dosage regimen based on body weight is preferable for BSREM, whereas a quadratic dosage regimen based on body weight is optimal for OSEM3D.

TITLE: Small lesion depiction and quantification accuracy of oncological 18F-FDG PET/CT with small voxel and Bayesian penalized likelihood reconstruction

AUTHORS: Lei Xu, Ru-Shuai Li, Run-Ze Wu, Rui Yang, Qin-Qin You, Xiao-Chen Yao, Hui-Fang Xie, Yang Lv, Yun Dong, Feng Wang, Qing-Le Meng

JOURNAL: EJNMMI physics

ABSTRACT:
Background: To investigate the influence of small voxel Bayesian penalized likelihood (SVB) reconstruction on small lesion detection compared to ordered subset expectation maximization (OSEM) reconstruction using a clinical trials network (CTN) chest phantom and the patients with18F-FDG-avid small lung tumors, and determine the optimal penalty factor for the lesion depiction and quantification.

Methods: The CTN phantom was filled with18F solution with a sphere-to-background ratio of 3.81:1. Twenty-four patients with18F-FDG-avid lung lesions (diameter < 2 cm) were enrolled. Six groups of PET images were reconstructed: routine voxel OSEM (RVOSEM), small voxel OSEM (SVOSEM), and SVB reconstructions with four penalty factors: 0.6, 0.8, 0.9, and 1.0 (SVB0.6, SVB0.8, SVB0.9, and SVB1.0). The routine and small voxel sizes are 4 × 4 × 4 and 2 × 2 × 2 mm3. The recovery coefficient (RC) was calculated by dividing the measured activity by the injected activity of the hot spheres in the phantom study. The SUVmax, target-to-liver ratio (TLR), contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), the volume of the lesions, and the image noise of the liver were measured and calculated in the patient study. Visual image quality of the patient image was scored by two radiologists using a 5-point scale.

Results: In the phantom study, SVB0.6, SVB0.8, and SVB0.9 achieved higher RCs than SVOSEM. The RC was higher in SVOSEM than RVOSEM and SVB1.0. In the patient study, the SUVmax, TLR, and visual image quality scores of SVB0.6 to SVB0.9 were higher than those of RVOSEM, while the image noise of SVB0.8 to SVB1.0 was equivalent to or lower than that of RVOSEM. All SVB groups had higher CNRs than RVOSEM, but there was no difference between RVOSEM and SVOSEM. The lesion volumes derived from SVB0.6 to SVB0.9 were accurate, but over-estimated by RVOSEM, SVOSEM, and SVB1.0, using the CT measurement as the standard reference.

Conclusions: The SVB reconstruction improved lesion contrast, TLR, CNR, and volumetric quantification accuracy for small lesions compared to RVOSEM reconstruction without image noise degradation or the need of longer emission time. A penalty factor of 0.8-0.9 was optimal for SVB reconstruction for the small tumor detection with18F-FDG PET/CT.

TITLE: Q.Clear reconstruction for reducing the scanning time for 68 Ga-DOTA-FAPI-04 PET/MR imaging

AUTHORS: Weiwei Ruan, Chunxia Qin, Fang Liu, Rundong Pi, Yongkang Gai, Qingyao Liu, Xiaoli Lan

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: This study aims to determine whether Q.Clear positron emission tomography (PET) reconstruction may reduce tracer injection dose or shorten scanning time in68Gallium-labelled fibroblast activation protein inhibitor (68Ga-FAPI) PET/magnetic resonance (MR) imaging.

Methods: We retrospectively collected cases of68Ga-FAPI whole-body imaging performed on integrated PET/MR. PET images were reconstructed using three different methods: ordered subset expectation maximization (OSEM) reconstruction with full scanning time, OSEM reconstruction with half scanning time, and Q.Clear reconstruction with half scanning time. We then measured standardized uptake values (SUVs) within and around lesions, alongside their volumes. We also evaluated image quality using lesion-to-background (L/B) ratio and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). We then compared these metrics across the three reconstruction techniques using statistical methods.

Results: Q.Clear reconstruction significantly increased SUVmaxand SUVmeanwithin lesions (more than 30%) and reduced their volumes in comparison with OSEM reconstruction. Background SUVmaxalso increased significantly, while background SUVmeanshowed no difference. Average L/B values for Q.Clear reconstruction were only marginally higher than those from OSME reconstruction with half-time. SNR decreased significantly in Q.Clear reconstruction compared with OSEM reconstruction with full time (but not half time). Differences between Q.Clear and OSEM reconstructions in SUVmaxand SUVmeanvalues within lesions were significantly correlated with SUVs within lesions.

Conclusions: Q.Clear reconstruction was useful for reducing PET injection dose or scanning time while maintaining the image quality. Q.Clear may affect PET quantification, and it is necessary to establish diagnostic recommendations based on Q.Clear results for Q.Clear application.

ABSTRACT:
Background: The Bayesian penalized likelihood (BPL) algorithm Q.Clear (GE Healthcare) allows fully convergent iterative reconstruction that results in better image quality and quantitative accuracy, while limiting image noise. The present study aimed to optimize BPL reconstruction parameters for18F-NaF PET/CT images and to determine the feasibility of18F-NaF PET/CT image acquisition over shorter durations in clinical practice.

Methods: A custom-designed thoracic spine phantom consisting of several inserts, soft tissue, normal spine, and metastatic bone tumor, was scanned using a Discovery MI PET/CT scanner (GE Healthcare). The phantom allows optional adjustment of activity distribution, tumor size, and attenuation. We reconstructed PET images using OSEM + PSF + TOF (2 iterations, 17 subsets, and a 4-mm Gaussian filter), BPL + TOF (β = 200 to 700), and scan durations of 30-120 s. Signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), contrast, and coefficients of variance (CV) as image quality indicators were calculated, whereas the quantitative measures were recovery coefficients (RC) and RC linearity over a range of activity. We retrospectively analyzed images from five persons without bone metastases (male, n = 1; female, n = 4), then standardized uptake values (SUV), CV, and SNR at the 4th, 5th, and 6th thoracic vertebra were calculated in BPL + TOF (β = 400) images.

Results: The optimal reconstruction parameter of the BPL was β = 400 when images were acquired at 120 s/bed. At 90 s/bed, the BPL with a β value of 400 yielded 24% and 18% higher SNR and contrast, respectively, than OSEM (2 iterations; 120 s acquisitions). The BPL was superior to OSEM in terms of RC and the RC linearity over a range of activity, regardless of scan duration. The SUVmaxwere lower in BPL, than in OSEM. The CV and vertebral SNR in BPL were superior to those in OSEM.

Conclusions: The optimal reconstruction parameters of18F-NaF PET/CT images acquired over different durations were determined. The BPL can reduce PET acquisition to 90 s/bed in18F-NaF PET/CT imaging. Our results suggest that BPL (β = 400) on SiPM-based TOF PET/CT scanner maintained high image quality and quantitative accuracy even for shorter acquisition durations.

TITLE: Performance evaluation of the Q.Clear reconstruction framework versus conventional reconstruction algorithms for quantitative brain PET-MR studies

AUTHORS: Daniela Ribeiro, William Hallett, Adriana A S Tavares

JOURNAL: EJNMMI physics

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Background: Q.Clear is a Bayesian penalized likelihood (BPL) reconstruction algorithm that presents improvements in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in clinical positron emission tomography (PET) scans. Brain studies in research require a reconstruction that provides a good spatial resolution and accentuates contrast features however, filtered back-projection (FBP) reconstruction is not available on GE SIGNA PET-Magnetic Resonance (PET-MR) and studies have been reconstructed with an ordered subset expectation maximization (OSEM) algorithm. This study aims to propose a strategy to approximate brain PET quantitative outcomes obtained from images reconstructed with Q.Clear versus traditional FBP and OSEM.

Methods: Contrast recovery and background variability were investigated with the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) Image Quality (IQ) phantom. Resolution, axial uniformity and SNR were investigated using the Hoffman phantom. Both phantoms were scanned on a Siemens Biograph 6 TruePoint PET-Computed Tomography (CT) and a General Electric SIGNA PET-MR, for FBP, OSEM and Q.Clear. Differences between the metrics obtained with Q.Clear with different β values and FBP obtained on the PET-CT were determined.

Results: For in plane and axial resolution, Q.Clear with low β values presented the best results, whereas for SNR Q.Clear with higher β gave the best results. The uniformity results are greatly impacted by the β value, where β < 600 can yield worse uniformity results compared with the FBP reconstruction.

Conclusion: This study shows that Q.Clear improves contrast recovery and provides better resolution and SNR, in comparison to OSEM, on the PET-MR. When using low β values, Q.Clear can provide similar results to the ones obtained with traditional FBP reconstruction, suggesting it can be used for quantitative brain PET kinetic modelling studies.

TITLE: FBP-Net for direct reconstruction of dynamic PET images

AUTHORS: Bo Wang, Huafeng Liu

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) imaging can provide information about metabolic changes over time, used for kinetic analysis and auxiliary diagnosis. Existing deep learning-based reconstruction methods have too many trainable parameters and poor generalization, and require mass data to train the neural network. However, obtaining large amounts of medical data is expensive and time-consuming. To reduce the need for data and improve the generalization of network, we combined the filtered back-projection (FBP) algorithm with neural network, and proposed FBP-Net which could directly reconstruct PET images from sinograms instead of post-processing the rough reconstruction images obtained by traditional methods. The FBP-Net contained two parts: the FBP part and the denoiser part. The FBP part adaptively learned the frequency filter to realize the transformation from the detector domain to the image domain, and normalized the coarse reconstruction images obtained. The denoiser part merged the information of all time frames to improve the quality of dynamic PET reconstruction images, especially the early time frames. The proposed FBP-Net was performed on simulation and real dataset, and the results were compared with the state-of-art U-net and DeepPET. The results showed that FBP-Net did not tend to overfit the training set and had a stronger generalization.

TITLE: B-Mode Ultrasound and Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound for the Detection of Splenic Involvement in Hodgkin Lymphoma: A Retrospective Analysis of 112 Patients

AUTHORS: Hajo Findeisen, Christian Görg, Helen Winter, Corinna Trenker, Christoph F Dietrich, Amjad Alhyari, Friederike Eilsberger, Ehsan Safai Zadeh

JOURNAL: Ultraschall in der Medizin (Stuttgart, Germany : 1980)

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: To assess splenic involvement using B-mode ultrasound (US) and contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) compared with standard imaging with contrast-enhanced computerized tomography (CT) / 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron-emission tomography (PET-CT) in patients with Hodgkin lymphoma.

Materials and methods: Imaging data from 112 patients from 12/2003 to 10/2022 with histologically confirmed Hodgkin lymphoma during staging or relapse were analyzed for splenic lymphoma involvement. In all patients, standard imaging (CT/PET-CT), along with B-mode US and CEUS examinations, was performed. Evidence of focal splenic lesions (FSLs) found by imaging procedures was suggestive of splenic involvement. Follow-up imaging was performed in each patient after treatment, and treatment response indicated definitive splenic involvement.

Results: 40 patients (35.7%) were identified by imaging modalities as having splenic involvement, which was confirmed by response during follow-up. Standard CT/PET-CT imaging detected splenic involvement in 36/112 patients (32.1%). FSLs were detected with B-mode US in 38 patients (33.9%) and CEUS in 36 patients (32.1%). The sensitivity of standard imaging, B-mode US, and CEUS was 90%, 95%, and 90%, respectively.

Conclusion: B-mode US examination is a diagnostic method used in addition to standard imaging for the detection of splenic involvement in Hodgkin lymphoma. CEUS does not provide additional benefit compared to B-mode US and the standard reference procedure.

TITLE: How fast can we scan patients with modern (digital) PET/CT systems?

AUTHORS: Charline Lasnon, Nicolas Coudrais, Benjamin Houdu, Catherine Nganoa, Thibault Salomon, Blandine Enilorac, Nicolas Aide

JOURNAL: European journal of radiology

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: To seek for the minimal duration per bed position with a digital PET system without compromising image quality and lesion detection in patients requiring fast18F-FDG PET imaging.

Materials and methods: 19 cancer patients experiencing pain or dyspnea and 9 pediatric patients were scanned on a Vereos system. List mode data were reconstructed with decreasing time frame down to 10 s per bed position. Noise was evaluated in the liver, blood pool and muscle, and using target-to-background ratios. Five PET readers recorded image quality, number of clinically relevant foci and of involved anatomical sites in reconstructions ranging from 60 to 10 s per bed position, compared to the standard 90 s reconstruction.

Results: The following reconstructions, which harboured a noise not significantly higher than that of the standard reconstruction, were selected for clinical evaluation: 1iterations/10 subsets/20sec(1i10 s20sec), 1i10 s30sec, and 2i10 sPSF60sec.Only the 60 s per bed acquisition displayed similar target-to-background ratios compared to the standard reconstruction, but mean ratios were still higher than 2.0 for the 30 s reconstruction. Inter-rater agreement for the number of involved anatomical sites and detected lesion was good or almost perfect (Kappa: 0.64-0.91) for all acquisitions. In particular, kappa for the 30 s per bed acquisition was 0.78 and 0.91 for lesion and anatomical sites number, respectively. Intra-rater agreement was also excellent for the 30 s reconstruction (kappa = 0.72). Median estimated total PET acquisition time for the 1i10 s30sec, and the standard reconstruction were 4 and 12 min, respectively.

Conclusions: Fast imaging is feasible with state-of-the-art PET systems. Acquisitions of 30 s per bed position are feasible with the Vereos system, requiring optimization of reconstruction parameters.

TITLE: Intensity threshold based solid tumour segmentation method for Positron Emission Tomography (PET) images: A review

AUTHORS: Mahbubunnabi Tamal

JOURNAL: Heliyon

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Accurate, robust and reproducible delineation of tumour in Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is essential for diagnosis, treatment planning and response assessment. Since standardized uptake value (SUV) - a normalized semiquantitative parameter used in PET is represented by the intensity of the PET images and related to the radiotracer uptake, a SUV based threshold method is a natural choice to delineate the tumour. However, determination of an optimum threshold value is a challenging task due to low spatial resolution, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) along with finite image sampling constraint. The aim of the review is to summarize different fixed and adaptive threshold-based PET image segmentation approaches under a common mathematical framework Advantages and disadvantages of different threshold based methods are also highlighted from the perspectives of diagnosis, treatment planning and response assessment. Several fixed threshold values (30%-70% of the maximum SUV of the tumour (SUVmaxT)) have been investigated. It has been reported that the fixed threshold-based method is very much dependent on the SNR, tumour to background ratio (TBR) and the size of the tumour. Adaptive threshold-based method, an alternative to fixed threshold, can minimize these dependencies by accounting for tumour to background ratio (TBR) and tumour size. However, the parameters for the adaptive methods need to be calibrated for each PET camera system (e.g., scanner geometry, image acquisition protocol, reconstruction algorithm etc.) and it is not straight forward to implement the same procedure to other PET systems to obtain similar results. It has been reported that the performance of the adaptive methods is also not optimum for smaller volumes with lower TBR and SNR. Statistical analysis carried out on the NEMA thorax phantom images also indicates that regions segmented by the fixed threshold method are significantly different for all cases. On the other hand, the adaptive method provides significantly different segmented regions only for low TBR with different SNR. From this viewpoint, a robust threshold based segmentation method that will be less sensitive to, SNR, TBR and volume needs to be developed. It was really challenging to compare the performance of different threshold-based methods because the performance of each method was tested on dissimilar data set with different data acquisition and reconstruction protocols along with different TBR, SNR and volumes. To avoid such difficulties, it will be desirable to have a common database of clinical PET images acquired with different image acquisition protocols and different PET cameras to compare the performance of automatic segmentation methods. It is also suggested to report the changes in SNR and TBR while reporting the response using threshold based methods.

TITLE: Yttrium-90 TOF-PET-Based EUD Predicts Response Post Liver Radioembolizations Using Recommended Manufacturer FDG Reconstruction Parameters

AUTHORS: Michel Hesse, Philipe d'Abadie, Renaud Lhommel, Francois Jamar, Stephan Walrand

JOURNAL: Frontiers in oncology

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Explaining why90Y TOF-PET based equivalent uniform dose (EUD) using recommended manufacturer FDG reconstruction parameters has been shown to predict response.

Methods: The hot rods insert of a Jaszczak deluxe phantom was partially filled with a 2.65 GBq90Y - 300ml DTPA water solution resulting in a 100 Gy mean absorbed dose in the 6 sectors. A two bed 20min/position acquisition was performed on a 550ps- and on a 320ps- TOF-PET/CT and reconstructed with recommended manufacturer FDG reconstruction parameters, without and with additional filtering. The whole procedure was repeated on both PET after adding 300ml of water (50Gy setup). The phantom was acquired again after decay by a factor of 10 (5Gy setup), but with 200min per bed position. For comparison, the phantom was also acquired with18F activity corresponding to a clinical FDG whole body acquisition.

Results: The 100Gy-setup provided a hot rod sectors image almost as good as the18F phantom. However, despite acquisition time compensation, the 5Gy-setup provides much lower quality imaging. TOF-PET based sectors EUDs for the three large rod sectors agreed with the actual EUDs computed with a radiosensitivity of 0.021Gy-1well in the range observed in external beam radiotherapy (EBRT), i.e. 0.01-0.04Gy-1. This agreement explains the reunification of the dose-response relationships of the glass and resin spheres in HCC using the TOF-PET based EUD. Additional filtering reduced the EUDs agreement quality.

Conclusions: Recommended manufacturer FDG reconstruction parameters are suitable in TOF-PET post90Y liver radioembolization for accurate tumour EUD computation. The present results rule out the use of low specific activity phantom studies to optimize reconstruction parameters.

TITLE: Impact of total variation regularized expectation maximization reconstruction on the image quality of 68Ga-PSMA PET: a phantom and patient study

AUTHORS: Feng-Jiao Yang, Shu-Yue Ai, Runze Wu, Yang Lv, Hui-Fang Xie, Yun Dong, Qing-Le Meng, Feng Wang

JOURNAL: The British journal of radiology

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Objectives: To investigate the impact of total variation regularized expectation maximization (TVREM) reconstruction on the image quality of68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT using phantom and patient data.

Methods: Images of a phantom with small hot sphere inserts and 20 prostate cancer patients were acquired with a digital PET/CT using list-mode and reconstructed with ordered subset expectation maximization (OSEM) and TVREM with seven penalisation factors between 0.01 and 0.42 for 2 and 3 minutes-per-bed (m/b) acquisition. The contrast recovery (CR) and background variability (BV) of the phantom, image noise of the liver, and SUVmaxof the lesions were measured. Qualitative image quality was scored by two radiologists using a 5-point scale (1-poor, 5-excellent).

Results: The performance of CR, BV, and image noise, and the gain of SUVmaxwas higher for TVREM 2 m/b groups with the penalization of 0.07 to 0.28 compared to OSEM 3 m/b group (allp< 0.05). The image noise of OSEM 3 m/b group was equivalent to TVREM 2 and 3 m/b groups with a penalization of 0.14 and 0.07, while lesions' SUVmaxincreased 15 and 20%. The highest qualitative score was attained at the penalization of 0.21 (3.30 ± 0.66) for TVREM 2 m/b groups and the penalization 0.14 (3.80 ± 0.41) for 3 m/b group that equal to or greater than OSEM 3 m/b group (2.90 ± 0.45,p= 0.2 andp< 0.001).

Conclusions: TVREM improves lesion contrast and reduces image noise, which allows shorter acquisition with preserved image quality for PSMA PET/CT.

Advances in knowledge: TVREM reconstruction with optimized penalization factors can generate higher quality PSMA-PET images for prostate cancer diagnosis.

TITLE: Impact of Reduced Image Noise on Deauville Scores in Patients with Lymphoma Scanned on a Long-Axial Field-of-View PET/CT-Scanner

AUTHORS: Kirsten Korsholm, Nanna Overbeck, André H Dias, Annika Loft, Flemming Littrup Andersen, Barbara Malene Fischer

JOURNAL: Diagnostics (Basel, Switzerland)

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Background: Total body and long-axial field-of-view (LAFOV) PET/CT represent visionary innovations in imaging enabling either improved image quality, reduction in injected activity-dose or decreased acquisition time. An improved image quality may affect visual scoring systems, including the Deauville score (DS), which is used for clinical assessment of patients with lymphoma. The DS compares SUVmax in residual lymphomas with liver parenchyma, and here we investigate the impact of reduced image noise on the DS in patients with lymphomas scanned on a LAFOV PET/CT.

Methods: Sixty-eight patients with lymphoma underwent a whole-body scan on a Biograph Vision Quadra PET/CT-scanner, and images were evaluated visually with regard to DS for three different timeframes of 90, 300, and 600 s. SUVmax and SUVmean were calculated from liver and mediastinal blood pool, in addition to SUVmax from residual lymphomas and measures of noise.

Results: SUVmax in liver and in mediastinal blood pool decreased significantly with increasing acquisition time, whereas SUVmean remained stable. In residual tumor, SUVmax was stable during different acquisition times. As a result, the DS was subject to change in three patients.

Conclusions: Attention should be drawn towards the eventual impact of improvements in image quality on visual scoring systems such as the DS.

TITLE: Reduction of [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-TATE injected activity for digital PET/MR in comparison with analogue PET/CT

AUTHORS: Christina P W Cox, Tessa Brabander, Erik Vegt, Quido G de Lussanet de la Sablonière, Laura H Graven, Frederik A Verburg, Marcel Segbers

JOURNAL: EJNMMI physics

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Background: New digital detectors and block-sequential regularized expectation maximization (BSREM) reconstruction algorithm improve positron emission tomography (PET)/magnetic resonance (MR) image quality. The impact on image quality may differ from analogue PET/computed tomography (CT) protocol. The aim of this study is to determine the potential reduction of injected [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-TATE activity for digital PET/MR with BSREM reconstruction while maintaining at least equal image quality compared to the current analogue PET/CT protocol.

Methods: NEMA IQ phantom data and 25 patients scheduled for a diagnostic PET/MR were included. According to our current protocol, 1.5 MBq [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-TATE per kilogram (kg) was injected. After 60 min, scans were acquired with 3 (≤ 70 kg) or 4 (> 70 kg) minutes per bedposition. PET/MR scans were reconstructed using BSREM and factors β 150, 300, 450 and 600. List mode data with reduced counts were reconstructed to simulate scans with 17%, 33%, 50% and 67% activity reduction. Image quality was measured quantitatively for PET/CT and PET/MR phantom and patient data. Experienced nuclear medicine physicians performed visual image quality scoring and lesion counting in the PET/MR patient data.

Results: Phantom analysis resulted in a possible injected activity reduction of 50% with factor β = 600. Quantitative analysis of patient images revealed a possible injected activity reduction of 67% with factor β = 600. Both with equal or improved image quality as compared to PET/CT. However, based on visual scoring a maximum activity reduction of 33% with factor β = 450 was acceptable, which was further limited by lesion detectability analysis to an injected activity reduction of 17% with factor β = 450.

Conclusion: A digital [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-TATE PET/MR together with BSREM using factor β = 450 result in 17% injected activity reduction with quantitative values at least similar to analogue PET/CT, without compromising on PET/MR visual image quality and lesion detectability.

TITLE: Evaluation of Data-Driven Respiration Gating in Continuous Bed Motion in Lung Lesions

AUTHORS: Takeshi Nii, Shota Hosokawa, Tomoya Kotani, Hiroshi Domoto, Yasunori Nakamura, Yasutomo Tanada, Ryotaro Kondo, Yasuyuki Takahashi

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear medicine technology

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Respiration gating is used in PET to prevent image quality degradation due to respiratory effects. In this study, we evaluated a type of data-driven respiration gating for continuous bed motion, OncoFreeze AI, which was implemented to improve image quality and the accuracy of semiquantitative uptake values affected by respiratory motion.Methods:18F-FDG PET/CT was performed on 32 patients with lung lesions. Two types of respiration-gated images (OncoFreeze AI with data-driven respiration gating, device-based amplitude-based OncoFreeze with elastic motion compensation) and ungated images (static) were reconstructed. For each image, we calculated SUV and metabolic tumor volume (MTV). The improvement rate (IR) from respiration gating and the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), which indicates the improvement in image noise, were also calculated for these indices. IR was also calculated for the upper and lower lobes of the lung. As OncoFreeze AI assumes the presence of respiratory motion, we examined quantitative accuracy in regions where respiratory motion was not present using a68Ge cylinder phantom with known quantitative accuracy.Results:OncoFreeze and OncoFreeze AI showed similar values, with a significant increase in SUV and decrease in MTV compared with static reconstruction. OncoFreeze and OncoFreeze AI also showed similar values for IR and CNR. OncoFreeze AI increased SUVmaxby an average of 18% and decreased MTV by an average of 25% compared with static reconstruction. From the IR results, both OncoFreeze and OncoFreeze AI showed a greater IR from static reconstruction in the lower lobe than in the upper lobe. OncoFreeze and OncoFreeze AI increased CNR by 17.9% and 18.0%, respectively, compared with static reconstruction. The quantitative accuracy of the68Ge phantom, assuming a region of no respiratory motion, was almost equal for the static reconstruction and OncoFreeze AI.Conclusion:OncoFreeze AI improved the influence of respiratory motion in the assessment of lung lesion uptake to a level comparable to that of the previously launched OncoFreeze. OncoFreeze AI provides more accurate imaging with significantly larger SUVs and smaller MTVs than static reconstruction.

TITLE: Effects of TOF Resolution Models on Edge Artifacts in PET Reconstruction from Limited-Angle Data

AUTHORS: Paul Gravel, Yusheng Li, Samuel Matej

JOURNAL: IEEE transactions on radiation and plasma medical sciences

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Limited-angle data, such as data obtained from a dual-panel Breast-PET scanner, result in substantial image blur in directions coinciding with the missing cone of the image spectrum. On systems with time-of-flight (TOF) capabilities, this blur is reduced as given by the TOF uncertainty, with the image spectrum being correspondingly expanded into the missing spectral cone. Modeling of the TOF uncertainty in the reconstruction is expected to deconvolve this residual TOF blurring. We have however observed that, as a tradeoff, this TOF de-blurring process also introduces ringing artifacts at the edges, analogous to the edge effects observed with line-of-response (LOR) resolution modeling, which attempts to deconvolve the blur due to detector resolution effects. However, in the former case, the ringing artifacts are much wider due to the spatial extent of the TOF uncertainty as compared to the width of typical LOR resolution blur. We illustrate and investigate the effects of using matched, as well as under-modeled and over-modeled, TOF kernels on edge artifacts in reconstruction from limited-angle data, and compare them with TOF reconstructions of complete data. Although for the conventional data with full angular coverage the reconstruction is fairly insensitive to the exact size of the TOF kernel and TOF modeling does not produce ringing artifacts, it is not the case for the limited-angle data. We show that it is important to use some form of regularization of the TOF uncertainty deconvolution process within reconstruction of the limited-angle data, such as decreasing the TOF kernel size.

AUTHORS: Hunor Kertész, Tatjana Traub-Weidinger, Jacobo Cal-Gonzalez, Ivo Rausch, Otto Muzik, Lalith Kumar Shyiam Sundar, Thomas Beyer

JOURNAL: Nuklearmedizin. Nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of reduced injected [18F]FDG activity levels on the quantitative and diagnostic accuracy of PET images of patients with non-lesional epilepsy (NLE).Nine healthy volunteers and nine patients with NLE underwent 60-min dynamic list-mode (LM) scans on a fully-integrated PET/MRI system. Injected FDG activity levels were reduced virtually by randomly removing counts from the last 10-min of the LM data, so as to simulate the following activity levels: 50 %, 35 %, 20 %, and 10 % of the original activity. Four image reconstructions were evaluated: standard OSEM, OSEM with resolution recovery (PSF), the A-MAP, and the Asymmetrical Bowsher (AsymBowsher) algorithms. For the A-MAP algorithms, two weights were selected (low and high). Image contrast and noise levels were evaluated for all subjects while the lesion-to-background ratio (L/B) was only evaluated for patients. Patient images were scored by a Nuclear Medicine physician on a 5-point scale to assess clinical impression associated with the various reconstruction algorithms.The image contrast and L/B ratio characterizing all four reconstruction algorithms were similar, except for reconstructions based on only 10 % of total counts. Based on clinical impression, images with diagnostic quality can be achieved with as low as 35 % of the standard injected activity. The selection of algorithms utilizing an anatomical prior did not provide a significant advantage for clinical readings, despite a small improvement in L/B (< 5 %) using the A-MAP and AsymBowsher reconstruction algorithms.In patients with NLE who are undergoing [18F]FDG-PET/MR imaging, the injected [18F]FDG activity can be reduced to 35 % of the original dose levels without compromising.

TITLE: Image-derived input functions from dynamic 15O-water PET scans using penalised reconstruction

AUTHORS: Peter Young, Lieuwe Appel, Andreas Tolf, Savvas Kosmidis, Joachim Burman, Anna Rieckmann, Michael Schöll, Mark Lubberink

JOURNAL: EJNMMI physics

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Background: Quantitative positron emission tomography (PET) scans of the brain typically require arterial blood sampling but this is complicated and logistically challenging. One solution to remove the need for arterial blood sampling is the use of image-derived input functions (IDIFs). Obtaining accurate IDIFs, however, has proved to be challenging, mainly due to the limited resolution of PET. Here, we employ penalised reconstruction alongside iterative thresholding methods and simple partial volume correction methods to produce IDIFs from a single PET scan, and subsequently, compare these to blood-sampled input curves (BSIFs) as ground truth. Retrospectively we used data from sixteen subjects with two dynamic15O-labelled water PET scans and continuous arterial blood sampling: one baseline scan and another post-administration of acetazolamide.

Results: IDIFs and BSIFs agreed well in terms of the area under the curve of input curves when comparing peaks, tails and peak-to-tail ratios with R2values of 0.95, 0.70 and 0.76, respectively. Grey matter cerebral blood flow (CBF) values showed good agreement with an average difference between the BSIF and IDIF CBF values of 2% ± and a coefficient of variation (CoV) of 7.3%.

Conclusion: Our results show promising results that a robust IDIF can be produced for dynamic15O-water PET scans using only the dynamic PET scan images with no need for a corresponding MRI or complex analytical techniques and thereby making routine clinical use of quantitative CBF measurements with15O-water feasible.

TITLE: Respiratory motion correction in F-18-FDG PET/CT impacts lymph node assessment in lung cancer patients

AUTHORS: Benjamin Noto, Wolfgang Roll, Laura Zinken, Robert Rischen, Laura Kerschke, Georg Evers, Walter Heindel, Michael Schäfers, Florian Büther

JOURNAL: EJNMMI research

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Backgrounds: Elastic motion correction in PET has been shown to increase image quality and quantitative measurements of PET datasets affected by respiratory motion. However, little is known on the impact of respiratory motion correction on clinical image evaluation in oncologic PET. This study evaluated the impact of motion correction on expert readers' lymph node assessment of lung cancer patients.

Methods: Forty-three patients undergoing F-18-FDG PET/CT for the staging of suspected lung cancer were included. Three different PET reconstructions were investigated: non-motion-corrected ("static"), belt gating-based motion-corrected ("BG-MC") and data-driven gating-based motion-corrected ("DDG-MC"). Assessment was conducted independently by two nuclear medicine specialists blinded to the reconstruction method on a six-point scale [Formula: see text] ranging from "certainly negative" (1) to "certainly positive" (6). Differences in [Formula: see text] between reconstruction methods, accounting for variation caused by readers, were assessed by nonparametric regression analysis of longitudinal data. From [Formula: see text], a dichotomous score for N1, N2, and N3 ("negative," "positive") and a subjective certainty score were derived. SUV and metabolic tumor volumes (MTV) were compared between reconstruction methods.

Results: BG-MC resulted in higher scores for N1 compared to static (p = 0.001), whereas DDG-MC resulted in higher scores for N2 compared to static (p = 0.016). Motion correction resulted in the migration of N1 from tumor free to metastatic on the dichotomized score, consensually for both readers, in 3/43 cases and in 2 cases for N2. SUV was significantly higher for motion-corrected PET, while MTV was significantly lower (all p < 0.003). No significant differences in the certainty scores were noted.

Conclusions: PET motion correction resulted in significantly higher lymph node assessment scores of expert readers. Significant effects on quantitative PET parameters were seen; however, subjective reader certainty was not improved.

TITLE: Toward standardization of tau PET imaging corresponding to various tau PET tracers: a multicenter phantom study

AUTHORS: Kei Wagatsuma, Kenta Miwa, Go Akamatsu, Tensho Yamao, Yuto Kamitaka, Minoru Sakurai, Naotoshi Fujita, Kohei Hanaoka, Hiroshi Matsuda, Kenji Ishii

JOURNAL: Annals of nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Objective: Tau positron emission tomography (PET) imaging is a recently developed non-invasive tool that can detect the density and extension of tau neurofibrillary tangles. Tau PET tracers have been validated to harmonize and accelerate their development and implementation in clinical practice. Whereas standard protocols including injected dose, uptake time, and duration have been determined for tau PET tracers, reconstruction parameters have not been standardized. The present study conducted phantom experiments based on tau pathology to standardize quantitative tau PET imaging parameters and optimize reconstruction conditions of PET scanners at four Japanese sites according to the results of phantom experiments.

Methods: The activity of 4.0 and 2.0 kBq/mL for Hoffman 3D brain and cylindrical phantoms, respectively, was estimated from published studies of brain activity using [18F]flortaucipir, [18F]THK5351, and [18F]MK6240. We developed an original tau-specific volume of interest template for the brain based on pathophysiological tau distribution in the brain defined as Braak stages. We acquired brain and cylindrical phantom images using four PET scanners. Iteration numbers were determined as contrast and recover coefficients (RCs) in gray (GM) and white (WM) matter, and the magnitude of the Gaussian filter was determined from image noise.

Results: Contrast and RC converged at ≥ 4 iterations, the error rates of RC for GM and WM were < 15% and 1%, respectively, and noise was < 10% in Gaussian filters of 2-4 mm in images acquired using the four scanners. Optimizing the reconstruction conditions for phantom tau PET images acquired by each scanner improved contrast and image noise.

Conclusions: The phantom activity was comprehensive for first- and second-generation tau PET tracers. The mid-range activity that we determined could be applied to later tau PET tracers. We propose an analytical tau-specific VOI template based on tau pathophysiological changes in patients with AD to standardize tau PET imaging. Phantom images reconstructed under the optimized conditions for tau PET imaging achieved excellent image quality and quantitative accuracy.

ABSTRACT:
We compared the image quality and quantification parameters through bayesian penalized likelihood reconstruction algorithm (Q.Clear) and ordered subset expectation maximization (OSEM) algorithm for 2-[18F]FDG-PET/CT scans performed for response monitoring in patients with metastatic breast cancer in prospective setting. We included 37 metastatic breast cancer patients diagnosed and monitored with 2-[18F]FDG-PET/CT at Odense University Hospital (Denmark). A total of 100 scans were analyzed blinded toward Q.Clear and OSEM reconstruction algorithms regarding image quality parameters (noise, sharpness, contrast, diagnostic confidence, artefacts, and blotchy appearance) using a five-point scale. The hottest lesion was selected in scans with measurable disease, considering the same volume of interest in both reconstruction methods. SULpeak(g/mL) and SUVmax(g/mL) were compared for the same hottest lesion. There was no significant difference regarding noise, diagnostic confidence, and artefacts within reconstruction methods; Q.Clear had significantly better sharpness (p< 0.001) and contrast (p= 0.001) than the OSEM reconstruction, while the OSEM reconstruction had significantly less blotchy appearance compared with Q.Clear reconstruction (p< 0.001). Quantitative analysis on 75/100 scans indicated that Q.Clear reconstruction had significantly higher SULpeak(5.33 ± 2.8 vs. 4.85 ± 2.5,p< 0.001) and SUVmax(8.27 ± 4.8 vs. 6.90 ± 3.8,p< 0.001) compared with OSEM reconstruction. In conclusion, Q.Clear reconstruction revealed better sharpness, better contrast, higher SUVmax, and higher SULpeak, while OSEM reconstruction had less blotchy appearance.

JOURNAL: Diagnostics (Basel, Switzerland)

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Various factors have been identified that influence quantitative accuracy and image interpretation in positron emission tomography (PET). Through the continuous introduction of new PET technology-both imaging hardware and reconstruction software-into clinical care, we now find ourselves in a transition period in which traditional and new technologies coexist. The effects on the clinical value of PET imaging and its interpretation in routine clinical practice require careful reevaluation. In this review, we provide a comprehensive summary of important factors influencing quantification and interpretation with a focus on recent developments in PET technology. Finally, we discuss the relationship between quantitative accuracy and subjective image interpretation.

ABSTRACT:
For multicenter clinical studies, characterizing the robustness of image-derived radiomics features is essential. Features calculated on PET images have been shown to be very sensitive to image noise. The purpose of this work was to investigate the efficacy of a relatively simple harmonization strategy on feature robustness and agreement. A purpose-built texture pattern phantom was scanned on 10 different PET scanners in 7 institutions with various different image acquisition and reconstruction protocols. An image harmonization technique based on equalizing a contrast-to-noise ratio was employed to generate a "harmonized" alongside a "standard" dataset for a reproducibility study. In addition, a repeatability study was performed with images from a single PET scanner of variable image noise, varying the binning time of the reconstruction. Feature agreement was measured using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). In the repeatability study, 81/93 features had a lower ICC on the images with the highest image noise as compared to the images with the lowest image noise. Using the harmonized dataset significantly improved the feature agreement for five of the six investigated feature classes over the standard dataset. For three feature classes, high feature agreement corresponded with higher sensitivity to the different patterns, suggesting a way to select suitable features for predictive models.

ABSTRACT:
A National Institutes of Health (NIH) and U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Science virtual workshop on shared general topics was held in July of 2021 and reported on in this publication in January of 2023. Following the inaugural 2021 joint meeting representatives from the DOE Office of Science and NIH met to discuss organizing a second joint workshop that would concentrate on radiation detection to bring together teams from both agencies and their grantee populations to stimulate collaboration and efficiency. To meet this scientific mission within the NIH and DOE radiation detection space, the organizers assembled workshop sessions covering the state-of-the-art in cameras, detectors, and sensors for radiation external and internal (diagnostic and therapeutic) to human, data acquisition and electronics, image reconstruction and processing, and the application of artificial intelligence. NIH and DOE are committed to continuing the process of convening a joint workshop every 12-24 months. This Special Report recaps the findings of this second workshop. Beyond showing only the innovations and areas of success, important gaps in our knowledge were defined and presented. We summarize by defining four areas of greatest opportunity and need that emerged from the unique, dynamic dialogue the in-person workshop provided the attendees.

AUTHORS: Tianyi Zeng, Jiaxu Zheng, Xinyuan Xia, Xin Chen, Beien Wang, Shuangyue Zhang, Adam Chandler, Tuoyu Cao, Lingzhi Hu, Qun Chen, Xu Chu

JOURNAL: EJNMMI physics

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Background: Integrated whole-body PET/MR technology continues to mature and is now extensively used in clinical settings. However, due to the special design architecture, integrated whole-body PET/MR comes with a few inherent limitations. Firstly, whole-body PET/MR lacks sensitivity and resolution for focused organs. Secondly, broader clinical access of integrated PET/MR has been significantly restricted due to its prohibitively high cost. The MR-compatible PET insert is an independent and removable PET scanner which can be placed within an MRI bore. However, the mobility and configurability of all existing MR-compatible PET insert prototypes remain limited.

Methods: An MR-compatible portable PET insert prototype, dual-panel portable PET (DP-PET), has been developed for simultaneous PET/MR imaging. Using SiPM, digital readout electronics, novel carbon fiber shielding, phase-change cooling, and MRI compatible battery power, DP-PET was designed to achieve high-sensitivity and high-resolution with compatibility with a clinical 3-T MRI scanner. A GPU-based reconstruction method with resolution modeling (RM) has been developed for the DP-PET reconstruction. We evaluated the system performance on PET resolution, sensitivity, image quality, and the PET/MR interference.

Results: The initial results reveal that the DP-PET prototype worked as expected in the MRI bore and caused minimal compromise to the MRI image quality. The PET performance was measured to show a spatial resolution ≤ 2.5 mm (parallel to the detector panels), maximum sensitivity = 3.6% at the center of FOV, and energy resolution = 12.43%. MR pulsing introduces less than 2% variation to the PET performance measurement results.

Conclusions: We developed a MR-compatible PET insert prototype and performed several studies to begin to characterize the performance of the proposed DP-PET. The results showed that the proposed DP-PET performed well in the MRI bore and would cause little influence on the MRI images. The Derenzo phantom test showed that the proposed reconstruction method could obtain high-quality images using DP-PET.

TITLE: Technological advancements in cancer diagnostics: Improvements and limitations

AUTHORS: Akhil Pulumati, Anika Pulumati, Bilikere S Dwarakanath, Amit Verma, Rao V L Papineni

JOURNAL: Cancer reports (Hoboken, N.J.)

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Background: Cancer is characterized by the rampant proliferation, growth, and infiltration of malignantly transformed cancer cells past their normal boundaries into adjacent tissues. It is the leading cause of death worldwide, responsible for approximately 19.3 million new diagnoses and 10 million deaths globally in 2020. In the United States alone, the estimated number of new diagnoses and deaths is 1.9 million and 609 360, respectively. Implementation of currently existing cancer diagnostic techniques such as positron emission tomography (PET), X-ray computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), and molecular diagnostic techniques, have enabled early detection rates and are instrumental not only for the therapeutic management of cancer patients, but also for early detection of the cancer itself. The effectiveness of these cancer screening programs are heavily dependent on the rate of accurate precursor lesion identification; an increased rate of identification allows for earlier onset treatment, thus decreasing the incidence of invasive cancer in the long-term, and improving the overall prognosis. Although these diagnostic techniques are advantageous due to lack of invasiveness and easier accessibility within the clinical setting, several limitations such as optimal target definition, high signal to background ratio and associated artifacts hinder the accurate diagnosis of specific types of deep-seated tumors, besides associated high cost. In this review we discuss various imaging, molecular, and low-cost diagnostic tools and related technological advancements, to provide a better understanding of cancer diagnostics, unraveling new opportunities for effective management of cancer, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).

Recent findings: Herein we discuss various technological advancements that are being utilized to construct an assortment of new diagnostic techniques that incorporate hardware, image reconstruction software, imaging devices, biomarkers, and even artificial intelligence algorithms, thereby providing a reliable diagnosis and analysis of the tumor. Also, we provide a brief account of alternative low cost-effective cancer therapy devices (CryoPop®, LumaGEM®, MarginProbe®) and picture archiving and communication systems (PACS), emphasizing the need for multi-disciplinary collaboration among radiologists, pathologists, and other involved specialties for improving cancer diagnostics.

Conclusion: Revolutionary technological advancements in cancer imaging and molecular biology techniques are indispensable for the accurate diagnosis and prognosis of cancer.

AUTHORS: Joey Labour, Philippe Boissard, Thomas Baudier, Fouzi Khayi, David Kryza, Pascale Veyrat Durebex, Sandrine Parisse-Di Martino, Thomas Mognetti, David Sarrut, Jean-Noël Badel

JOURNAL: EJNMMI physics

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Background: PET imaging of90Y-microsphere distribution following radioembolisation is challenging due to the count-starved statistics from the low branching ratio of e+/e-pair production during90Y decay. PET systems using silicon photo-multipliers have shown better90Y image quality compared to conventional photo-multiplier tubes. The main goal of the present study was to evaluate reconstruction parameters for different phantom configurations and varying listmode acquisition lengths to improve quantitative accuracy in90Y dosimetry, using digital photon counting PET/CT.

Methods: Quantitative PET and dosimetry accuracy were evaluated using two uniform cylindrical phantoms specific for PET calibration validation. A third body phantom with a 9:1 hot sphere-to-background ratio was scanned at different activity concentrations of90Y. Reconstructions were performed using OSEM algorithm with varying parameters. Time-of-flight and point-spread function modellings were included in all reconstructions. Absorbed dose calculations were carried out using voxel S-values convolution and were compared to reference Monte Carlo simulations. Dose-volume histograms and root-mean-square deviations were used to evaluate reconstruction parameter sets. Using listmode data, phantom and patient datasets were rebinned into various lengths of time to assess the influence of count statistics on the calculation of absorbed dose. Comparisons between the local energy deposition method and the absorbed dose calculations were performed.

Results: Using a 2-mm full width at half maximum post-reconstruction Gaussian filter, the dosimetric accuracy was found to be similar to that found with no filter applied but also reduced noise. Larger filter sizes should not be used. An acquisition length of more than 10 min/bed reduces image noise but has no significant impact in the quantification of phantom or patient data for the digital photon counting PET. 3 iterations with 10 subsets were found suitable for large spheres whereas 1 iteration with 30 subsets could improve dosimetry for smaller spheres.

Conclusion: The best choice of the combination of iterations and subsets depends on the size of the spheres. However, one should be careful on this choice, depending on the imaging conditions and setup. This study can be useful in this choice for future studies for more accurate90Y post-dosimetry using a digital photon counting PET/CT.

TITLE: Reconstruction of multi-animal PET acquisitions with anisotropically variant PSF

AUTHORS: F Arias-Valcayo, P Galve, Joaquín L Herraiz, J J Vaquero, M Desco, J M Udías

JOURNAL: Biomedical physics & engineering express

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Among other factors such as random, attenuation and scatter corrections, uniform spatial resolution is key to performing accurate quantitative studies in Positron emission tomography (PET). Particularly in preclinical PET studies involving simultaneous acquisition of multiple animals, the degradation of image resolution due to the depth of interaction (DOI) effect far from the center of the Field of View (FOV) becomes a significant concern. In this work, we incorporated a spatially-variant resolution model into a real time iterative reconstruction code to obtain accurate images of multi-animal acquisition. We estimated the spatially variant point spread function (SV-PSF) across the FOV using measurements and Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. The SV-PSF obtained was implemented in a GPU-based Ordered subset expectation maximization (OSEM) reconstruction code, which includes scatter, attenuation and random corrections. The method was evaluated with acquisitions from two preclinical PET/CT scanners of the SEDECAL Argus family: a Derenzo phantom placed 2 cm off center in the 4R-SuperArgus, and a multi-animal study with 4 mice in the 6R-SuperArgus. The SV-PSF reconstructions showed uniform spatial resolution without significant increase in reconstruction time, with superior image quality compared to the uniform PSF model.

AUTHORS: Jason Bini, Christine R Lattin, Takuya Toyonaga, Sjoerd J Finnema, Richard Carson

JOURNAL: IEEE transactions on radiation and plasma medical sciences

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
PET imaging of small animals is often used for assessing biodistribution of a novel radioligand and pharmacology in small animal models of disease. PET acquisition and processing settings may affect reference region or image-derived input function (IDIF) kinetic modeling estimates. We examined four different factors in comparing quantitative results: 1) effect of reconstruction algorithm, 2) number of MAP iterations, 3) strength of the MAP prior, and 4) Attenuation and scatter. The effect of these parameters has not been explored for small-animal reference region and IDIF kinetic modeling approaches. Dynamic PET/CT scans were performed in 3 species with 3 different tracers: house sparrows with [11C]raclopride, rats with [18F]AS2471907 (11βHSD1) and mice with [11C]UCB-J (SV2A). FBP yielded lower kinetic modeling estimates compared to 3D-OSEM-MAP reconstructions, in sparrow and rat studies. Target resolutions (MAP prior strength) of 1.5 and 3.0mm demonstrated reducedin rats but only 3.0mm reduced BPNDin sparrows. Therefore, use of the highest target resolution (0.8mm) is warranted. We demonstrated using kinetic modeling that forgoing CT-based attenuation and scatter correction may be appropriate to improve animal throughput when using short-lived radioisotopes in sparrows and mice. This work provides recommendations and a framework for future optimization of kinetic modeling for preclinical PET methodology with novel radioligands.

TITLE: Challenges and opportunities to integrate artificial intelligence in radiation oncology: a narrative review

AUTHORS: Chiyoung Jeong, YoungMoon Goh, Jungwon Kwak

JOURNAL: Ewha medical journal

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming various medical fields, including radiation oncology. This review explores the integration of AI into radiation oncology, highlighting both challenges and opportunities. AI can improve the precision, efficiency, and outcomes of radiation therapy by optimizing treatment planning, enhancing image analysis, facilitating adaptive radiation therapy, and enabling predictive analytics. Through the analysis of large datasets to identify optimal treatment parameters, AI can automate complex tasks, reduce planning time, and improve accuracy. In image analysis, AI-driven techniques enhance tumor detection and segmentation by processing data from CT, MRI, and PET scans to enable precise tumor delineation. In adaptive radiation therapy, AI is beneficial because it allows real-time adjustments to treatment plans based on changes in patient anatomy and tumor size, thereby improving treatment accuracy and effectiveness. Predictive analytics using historical patient data can predict treatment outcomes and potential complications, guiding clinical decision-making and enabling more personalized treatment strategies. Challenges to AI adoption in radiation oncology include ensuring data quality and quantity, achieving interoperability and standardization, addressing regulatory and ethical considerations, and overcoming resistance to clinical implementation. Collaboration among researchers, clinicians, data scientists, and industry stakeholders is crucial to overcoming these obstacles. By addressing these challenges, AI can drive advancements in radiation therapy, improving patient care and operational efficiencies. This review presents an overview of the current state of AI integration in radiation oncology and insights into future directions for research and clinical practice.

TITLE: The Impact of Total Variation Regularized Expectation Maximization Reconstruction on 68Ga-DOTA-TATE PET/CT Images in Patients With Neuroendocrine Tumor

AUTHORS: Lin Liu, Hanxiang Liu, Shijie Xu, Shumao Zhang, Yi Tao, Greta S P Mok, Yue Chen

JOURNAL: Frontiers in medicine

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of the total variation regularized expectation maximization (TVREM) reconstruction on improving68Ga-DOTA-TATE PET/CT images compared to the ordered subset expectation maximization (OSEM) reconstruction.

Method: A total of 17 patients with neuroendocrine tumors who underwent clinical68Ga-DOTA-TATE PET/CT were involved in this study retrospectively. The PET images were acquired with either 3 min-per-bed (min/bed) acquisition time and reconstructed with OSEM (2 iterations, 20 subsets, and a 3.2-mm Gaussian filter) and TVREM (seven penalization factors = 0.01, 0.07, 0.14, 0.21, 0.28, 0.35, and 0.42) for 2 and 3 min-per-bed (min/bed) acquisition time using list-mode. The SUVmeanof the liver, background variability (BV), signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), SUVmaxof the lesions and tumor-to-background ratios (TBR) were measured. The mean percentage difference in the SNR and TBR between TVREM with difference penalization factors and OSEM was calculated. Qualitative image quality was evaluated by two experienced radiologists using a 5-point score scale (5-excellent, 1-poor).

Results: In total, 63 lesions were analyzed in this study. The SUVmeanof the liver did not differ significantly between TVREM and OSEM. The BV of all TVREM groups was lower than OSEM groups (allp< 0.05), and the BV of TVREM 2 min/bed group with penalization factor of 0.21 was considered comparable to OSEM 3 min/bed group (p= 0.010 and 0.006). The SNR, SUVmaxand TBR were higher for all TVREM groups compared to OSEM groups (allp< 0.05). The mean percentage difference in the SNR and TBR was larger for small lesions (<10 mm) than that for medium (≥10 mm but < 20 mm) and large lesions (≥20 mm). The highest image quality score was given to TVREM 2 min/bed group with penalization factor of 0.21 (3.77 ± 0.26) and TVREM 3 min/bed group with penalization factor of 0.35 (3.77 ± 0.26).

Conclusion: TVREM could reduce image noise, improve the SNR, SUVmaxand TBR of the lesions, and has the potential to preserves the image quality with shorter acquisition time.

TITLE: Three-dimensional treatment-planning-based prediction of seed migration to chest after 125I seed brachytherapy for hepatic malignancy

AUTHORS: Han Jiang, Ang Li, Kun Ke, Zhengzhong Wu, Jingyao Huang, Ning Huang, Quan Shen, Zhongyou Ji, Weizhu Yang, Junqing Lin

JOURNAL: Brachytherapy

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: To develop and validate risk models incorporating clinical and/or imaging parameters based on three-dimensional treatment-planning systems (3D-TPS) to predict the occurrence of125I seed migration and the number of migrated seeds <2/≥2 to the chest after brachytherapy for patients with malignant hepatic tumors.

Methods and materials: A total of 480 patients diagnosed with malignant liver tumors receiving125I seed brachytherapy from July 2010 to May 2020 were retrospectively enrolled. Variables included 3D-TPS-based CT parameters, that is, the distance from the seed to the inferior vena cava (DSI), the distance from the seed to the second hepatic portal (DSP) and the angle from the seed to the second hepatic portal (ASP), and patients' clinical characteristics, that is, the number of seed implantation procedures (NSP), the maximum number of implanted seeds one time (MAX) and laboratory parameters within 1 week before treatment. Two sets of logistic regression models incorporating clinical and/or imaging variables were developed to predict the occurrence of seed migration and the number of migrated seeds <2/≥2. Model performance was assessed by ROC analysis and decision curve analysis.

Results: Compared with the clinical models, the combined model showed a higher discriminative ability for both the prediction of migration occurrence and number of migrated seeds ≥ 2/<2 to the chest (AUC, 0.879 vs. 0.668, p < 0.05; 0.895 vs. 0.701, p < 0.05). The decision curve analysis results indicated higher net benefits of combined models than clinical models. Variables, including DSI, NSP and pretreatment lymphocyte-to-neutrophil ratio, acted as the most important predictors in combined models.

Conclusions: The proposed combined models based on 3D-TPS improved discriminative abilities for predicting125I seed migration and number of migrated seeds <2/≥2 to the chest after hepatic brachytherapy, being promising to aid clinical decision-making.

TITLE: Enhancing the Diagnostic Accuracy of Amyloid PET: The Impact of MR-Guided PET Reconstruction

AUTHORS: M Mehdi Khalighi, Christina B Young, Skylar Weiss, Michael Zeineh, Guido Davidzon, Elizabeth Mormino, Greg Zaharchuk

JOURNAL: medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
18F-Florbetaben (FBB) uptake in the supratentorial cortex is indicative of amyloid positivity. Due to PET's low spatial resolution, image noise, and spill-over of signal from adjacent white-matter into gray-matter, trained readers may provide inconsistent reads and quantitative calculations like Centiloids (CLs) are also affected. A set of 26418F-Florbetaben (amyloid) PET/MRI exams were reconstructed using conventional ordered subset expectation maximization (OSEM) method and MR-guided block sequential regularized expectation maximization (MRgBSREM) method. Images from 264 patients reconstructed by OSEM method and rated by 3 trained readers. Fifty-three exams were rated inconsistently and were mixed with another 53 exams which were rated consistently. These 106 subjects were then rated by our readers using the MRgBSREM PET reconstruction method. CLs were measured using both reconstruction methods. There is significant correlation between CL measured by OSEM and MRgBSREM methods with R2=0.99. The number of inconsistent exams dropped by 64% using MRgBSREM method as compared with OSEM method. Using Fleiss-Kappa statistical test, the agreement between readers was raised from "Fair" to "Significant" in the 106-subjects subset. PET reconstruction with MR priors can significantly improve the consistency of ratings among trained readers. Given the prevalence of inconsistent ratings in amyloid PET, methods that enhance the ability to distinguish intermediate amyloid levels could be valuable for the widespread adoption of this modality.

TITLE: Influence of X-ray computed tomography (CT) exposure and reconstruction parameters on positron emission tomography (PET) quantitation

AUTHORS: Ivan Ho Shon, Christopher Reece, Thomas Hennessy, Megan Horsfield, Bruce McBride

JOURNAL: EJNMMI physics

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Background: The CT of PET CT provides diagnostic information, anatomic localisation and attenuation correction (AC). When only AC is required, very lose dose CT is desirable. CT iterative reconstruction (IR) improves image quality with lower exposures however there is little data on very low dose IR CT for AC of PET. This work assesses the impact of CT exposure and reconstruction algorithm on PET voxel values.

Method: An anthropomorphic torso phantom was filled with physiologically typical [18]F concentrations in heart, liver and background compartments. A 17-mm-diameter right lung "tumour" filled with [18]F was included (surrounding lung contained no 18[F]). PET was acquired followed by 24 CT acquisitions with varying CT exposures (15-50 mAs, 80-120 kVp, pitch 0.671 or 0.828). Each CT was reconstructed twice using filtered back projection (FBP) or IR and these used for AC of PET. The reference PET reconstruction (RR) used CT acquired at 50 mAs, 120 kVp, pitch 0.828, IR, all others were test PET reconstructions (TR). Regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn in the liver, soft tissue and over "tumour" on each TR and compared with the RR. Voxel values in each TR were compared to the RR using a paired t test and by calculating which and what proportion of voxels in each TR differed by a quantitatively significant difference (QSD) from the RR.

Results: TRs reconstructed using lower dose CTs underestimated mean and maximum ROI activity relative to the RR; greater with IR than FBP. Once CT dose index (CTDI) increased to 1 mGy, differences were less than QSD. On voxel analysis, all TRs were significantly different to the RR (p < 0.0001). TRs reconstructed at the lowest CT exposure with IR had 6% of voxels that differed by greater than QSD. Differences were reduced with increasing CTDI and FBP reconstruction. Voxels which exceeded the QSD were spatially localised to regions of high activity, interfaces between different attenuation and areas of CT beam hardening.

Conclusions: Very low dose CT exposures are feasible for accurate PET AC. Scanner- and reconstruction-specific validation should be employed prior very low dose CT AC for PET.

ABSTRACT:
Objective: The objective of this study is to determine the optimal β value for clinical use in digital 68 Ga-prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA-11) PET/computed tomography (CT) imaging.

Methods: 68 Ga PSMA PET/CT of 21 patients with prostate cancer were reconstructed using block-sequential regularized expectation maximization ( β value of 400-1600) and ordered subsets expectation maximization. Nine independent blinded readers evaluated each reconstruction for overall image quality, noise level and lesion detectability. Maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of the most intense lesion, liver SUVmean and liver SUV SD were recorded. Lesions were then subdivided according to uptake and size; the SUVmax of these lesions were analyzed.

Results: There is a statistically significant correlation between improvement in image quality and β value, with the best being β 1400. This trend was also seen in image noise ( P < 0.001), with the least image noise reported with β 1400. Lesion detectability was not significantly different between the different β values ( P = 0.6452). There was no statistically significant difference in SUVmax of the most intense lesion ( P = 0.9966) and SUVmean of liver background between the different β values ( P = 0.9999); however, the SUV SD of the liver background showed a clear trend, with the lowest with β 1400 ( P = 0.0008). There was a decreasing trend observed in SUVmax when β values increased from 800 to 1400 for all four subgroups, and this decrease was greatest in small and low uptake lesions.

Conclusion: Bayesian penalized likelihood reconstruction algorithms improve image quality without affecting lesion detectability. A β value of 1400 is optimal.

TITLE: 2.5D Multi-view Averaging Diffusion Model for 3D Medical Image Translation: Application to Low-count PET Reconstruction with CT-less Attenuation Correction

AUTHORS: Tianqi Chen, Jun Hou, Yinchi Zhou, Huidong Xie, Xiongchao Chen, Qiong Liu, Xueqi Guo, Menghua Xia, James S Duncan, Chi Liu, Bo Zhou

JOURNAL: IEEE transactions on medical imaging

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is an important clinical imaging tool but inevitably introduces radiation exposure to patients and healthcare providers. Reducing the tracer injection dose and eliminating the CT acquisition for attenuation correction can reduce the overall radiation dose, but often results in PET with high noise and bias. Thus, it is desirable to develop 3D methods to translate the non-attenuation-corrected low-dose PET (NAC-LDPET) into attenuation-corrected standard-dose PET (AC-SDPET). Recently, diffusion models have emerged as a new state-of-the-art deep learning method for image-to-image translation, better than traditional CNN-based methods. However, due to the high computation cost and memory burden, it is largely limited to 2D applications. To address these challenges, we developed a novel 2.5D Multi-view Averaging Diffusion Model (MADM) for 3D image-to-image translation with application on NAC-LDPET to AC-SDPET translation. Specifically, MADM employs separate diffusion models for axial, coronal, and sagittal views, whose outputs are averaged in each sampling step to ensure the 3D generation quality from multiple views. To accelerate the 3D sampling process, we also proposed a strategy to use the CNN-based 3D generation as a prior for the diffusion model. Our experimental results on human patient studies suggested that MADM can generate high-quality 3D translation images, outperforming previous CNN-based and Diffusion-based baseline methods. The code is available at https://github.com/tianqic/MADM.

TITLE: Optimisation of CT protocols in PET-CT across different scanner models using different automatic exposure control methods and iterative reconstruction algorithms

AUTHORS: Sarah-May Gould, Jane Mackewn, Sugama Chicklore, Gary J R Cook, Andrew Mallia, Lucy Pike

JOURNAL: EJNMMI physics

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Background: A significant proportion of the radiation dose from a PET-CT examination is dependent on the CT protocol, which should be optimised for clinical purposes. Matching protocols on different scanners within an imaging centre is important for the consistency of image quality and dose. This paper describes our experience translating low-dose CT protocols between scanner models utilising different automatic exposure control (AEC) methods and reconstruction algorithms.

Methods: The scanners investigated were a newly installed Siemens Biograph mCT PET with 64-slice SOMATOM Definition AS CT using sinogram affirmed iterative reconstruction (SAFIRE) and two GE Discovery 710 PET scanners with 128-slice Optima 660 CT using adaptive statistical reconstruction (ASiR). Following exploratory phantom work, 33 adult patients of various sizes were scanned using the Siemens scanner and matched to patients scanned using our established GE protocol to give 33 patient pairs. A comparison of volumetric CT dose index (CTDIvol) and image noise within these patient pairs informed optimisation, specifically for obese patients. Another matched patient study containing 27 patient pairs was used to confirm protocol matching. Size-specific dose estimates (SSDEs) were calculated for patients in the second cohort. With the acquisition protocol for the Siemens scanner determined, clinicians visually graded the images to identify optimal reconstruction parameters.

Results: In the first matched patient study, the mean percentage difference in CTDIvolfor Siemens compared to GE was - 10.7% (range - 41.7 to 50.1%), and the mean percentage difference in noise measured in the patients' liver was 7.6% (range - 31.0 to 76.8%). In the second matched patient study, the mean percentage difference in CTDIvolfor Siemens compared to GE was - 20.5% (range - 43.1 to 1.9%), and the mean percentage difference in noise was 19.8% (range - 27.0 to 146.8%). For these patients, the mean SSDEs for patients scanned on the Siemens and GE scanners were 3.27 (range 2.83 to 4.22) mGy and 4.09 (range 2.81 to 4.82) mGy, respectively. The analysis of the visual grading study indicated no preference for any of the SAFIRE strengths.

Conclusions: Given the different implementations of acquisition parameters and reconstruction algorithms between vendors, careful consideration is required to ensure optimisation and standardisation of protocols.

TITLE: Design and proof of concept of a double-panel TOF-PET system

AUTHORS: Andrea Gonzalez-Montoro, Noriel Pavón, Julio Barberá, Neus Cuarella, Antonio J González, Santiago Jiménez-Serrano, Alejandro Lucero, Laura Moliner, David Sánchez, Koldo Vidal, José M Benlloch

JOURNAL: EJNMMI physics

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Objective: Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a well-known imaging technology for the diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of several diseases. Most PET scanners use a Ring-Shaped Detector Configuration (RSDC), which helps obtain homogeneous image quality but are restricted to an invariable Field-of-View (FOV), scarce spatial resolution, and low sensitivity. Alternatively, few PET systems use Open Detector Configurations (ODC) to permit an accessible FOV adaptable to different target sizes, thus optimizing sensitivity. Yet, to compensate the lack of angular coverage in ODC-PET, developing a detector with high-timing performance is mandatory to enable Time-of-Flight (TOF) techniques during reconstruction. The main goal of this work is to provide a proof of concept PET scanner appropriate for constructing the new generation of ODC-PET suitable for biopsy guidance and clinical intervention during acquisition. The designed detector has to be compact and robust, and its requirements in terms of performance are spatial and time resolutions < 2 mm and < 200 ps, respectively.

Methods: The present work includes a simulation study of an ODC-PET based on 2-panels with variable distance. The image quality (IQ) and Derenzo phantoms have been simulated and evaluated. The phantom simulations have also been performed using a ring-shaped PET for comparison purposes of the ODC approach with conventional systems. Then, an experimental evaluation of a prototype detector that has been designed following the simulation results is presented. This study focused on tuning the ASIC parameters and evaluating the scintillator surface treatment (ESR and TiO2), and configuration that yields the best Coincidence Time Resolution (CTR). Moreover, the scalability of the prototype to a module of 64 × 64mm2and its preliminary evaluation regarding pixel identification are provided.

Results: The simulation results reported sensitivity (%) values at the center of the FOV of 1.96, 1.63, and 1.18 for panel distances of 200, 250, and 300 mm, respectively. The IQ reconstructed image reported good uniformity (87%) and optimal CRC values, and the Derenzo phantom reconstruction suggests a system resolution of 1.6-2 mm. The experimental results demonstrate that using TiO2coating yielded better detector performance than ESR. Acquired data was filtered by applying an energy window of ± 30% at the photopeak level. After filtering, best CTR of 230 ± 2 ps was achieved for an 8 × 8 LYSO pixel block with 2 × 2 × 12mm3each. The detector performance remained constant after scaling-up the prototype to a module of 64×64mm2, and the flood map demonstrates the module's capabilities to distinguish the small pixels; thus, a spatial resolution < 2 mm (pixel size) is achieved.

Conclusions: The simulated results of this biplanar scanner show high performance in terms of image quality and sensitivity. These results are comparable to state-of-the-art PET technology and, demonstrate that including TOF information minimizes the image artifacts due to the lack of angular projections. The experimental results concluded that using TiO2coating provide the best performance. The results suggest that this scanner may be suitable for organ study, breast, prostate, or cardiac applications, with good uniformity and CRC.

TITLE: 3D optical/CT as a preclinical companion imaging platform for glioblastoma drug development

AUTHORS: Andrei Molotkov, Mikhail Doubrovin, Nikunj Bhatt, Fang-Chi Hsu, Amanda Beserra, Rajiv Chopra, Akiva Mintz

JOURNAL: Drug delivery

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Multimodality 3D Optical Imaging (OI)/CT has the potential to play a major role in drug development for glioblastomas (GBM), as it is an accessible preclinical method. To demonstrate the potential of 3D OI/CT to visualize orthotopic GBM implantation, we labeled GBM cells with Cy7 and imaged their location using 3D OI/CT. To confirm the accuracy of the spatial localization and demonstrate the ability to image locoregionally delivered therapies, we labeled mouse albumin with Cy7 (Cy7ALB) and delivered it via locoregional infusion 1 mm or 3 mm into the brain and demonstrated correlation of signal between the 3D OI/CT and post necropsy brain slices. In addition, we demonstrated the potential of systemically delivered Cy7ALB contrast to detect blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability caused by orthotopic GBMs using 3D OI/CT. We also tested the potential of 3D OI/CT to assess focal BBB permeability induced by high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), a methodology being used in clinical trials to noninvasively permeabilize the BBB for systemic therapeutic delivery to GBM. We demonstrated the ability of systemic Cy7ALB contrast together with 3D OI/CT to accurately assess real-time HIFU-induced BBB permeability, which correlated to post necropsy imaging of brains. Furthermore, we demonstrated that 3D OI/CT can also image the therapeutic distribution of a Cy7-labeled anti-PD-1 antibody, a prototype translational antibody therapy. We successfully imaged real-time antibody distribution after HIFU-induced BBB permeability, which correlated with post necropsy Cy7 signal and translational PET imaging after injection of [89Zr] anti-PD-1 antibody. Thus, we demonstrated the broad potential of using 3D OI/CT as an accessible preclinical tool to develop anti-GBM therapies.

AUTHORS: René Hosch, Manuel Weber, Miriam Sraieb, Nils Flaschel, Johannes Haubold, Moon-Sung Kim, Lale Umutlu, Jens Kleesiek, Ken Herrmann, Felix Nensa, Christoph Rischpler, Sven Koitka, Robert Seifert, David Kersting

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Both digital positron emission tomography (PET) detector technologies and artificial intelligence based image post-reconstruction methods allow to reduce the PET acquisition time while maintaining diagnostic quality. The aim of this study was to acquire ultra-low-count fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) ExtremePET images on a digital PET/computed tomography (CT) scanner at an acquisition time comparable to a CT scan and to generate synthetic full-dose PET images using an artificial neural network.

Methods: This is a prospective, single-arm, single-center phase I/II imaging study. A total of 587 patients were included. For each patient, a standard and an ultra-low-count FDG PET/CT scan (whole-body acquisition time about 30 s) were acquired. A modified pix2pixHD deep-learning network was trained employing 387 data sets as training and 200 as test cohort. Three models (PET-only and PET/CT with or without group convolution) were compared. Detectability and quantification were evaluated.

Results: The PET/CT input model with group convolution performed best regarding lesion signal recovery and was selected for detailed evaluation. Synthetic PET images were of high visual image quality; mean absolute lesion SUVmax(maximum standardized uptake value) difference was 1.5. Patient-based sensitivity and specificity for lesion detection were 79% and 100%, respectively. Not-detected lesions were of lower tracer uptake and lesion volume. In a matched-pair comparison, patient-based (lesion-based) detection rate was 89% (78%) for PERCIST (PET response criteria in solid tumors)-measurable and 36% (22%) for non PERCIST-measurable lesions.

Conclusion: Lesion detectability and lesion quantification were promising in the context of extremely fast acquisition times. Possible application scenarios might include re-staging of late-stage cancer patients, in whom assessment of total tumor burden can be of higher relevance than detailed evaluation of small and low-uptake lesions.

TITLE: Exploration of the total-body PET/CT reconstruction protocol with ultra-low 18F-FDG activity over a wide range of patient body mass indices

AUTHORS: Xiuli Sui, Hui Tan, Haojun Yu, Jie Xiao, Chi Qi, Yanyan Cao, Shuguang Chen, Yiqiu Zhang, Pengcheng Hu, Hongcheng Shi

JOURNAL: EJNMMI physics

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: The purpose of this study was to investigate the image quality and diagnostic performance of different reconstructions over a wide range of patient body mass indices (BMIs) obtained by total-body PET/CT with ultra-low18F-FDG activity (0.37 MBq/kg).

Methods: A total of 63 patients who underwent total-body PET/CT with ultra-low activity (0.37 MBq/kg)18F-FDG were enrolled. Patients were grouped by their BMIs. Images were reconstructed with the following two algorithms: the ordered subset expectation maximization (OSEM) algorithm (2, 3 iterations), both with time of flight (TOF) and point spread function (PSF) corrections (hereinafter referred as OSEM2, OSEM3) and HYPER Iterative algorithm (β-values of 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6) embedded TOF and PSF technologies (hereinafter referred as HYPER0.3, HYPER0.4, HYPER0.5 and HYPER0.6, respectively). Subjective image quality was assessed by two experienced nuclear medicine physicians according to the Likert quintile, including overall image quality, image noise and lesion conspicuity. The standard deviation (SD) and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the liver, and maximum standard uptake value (SUVmax), peak standard uptake value (SUVpeak), tumour background ratio (T/N) and the largest diameter of lesions were quantitatively analysed by a third reader who did not participate in the subjective image assessment.

Results: Increased noise was associated with increased BMI in all reconstruction groups. Significant differences occurred in the liver SNR among BMI categories of OSEM reconstructions (P < 0.001) but no difference was seen in the HYPER Iterative reconstructions between any of the BMI categories (P > 0.05). With the increase in BMI, overall image quality and image noise scores decreased significantly in all reconstructions, but there was no statistically significant difference of lesion conspicuity. The overall image quality score of the obese group was not qualified (score = 2.7) in OSEM3, while the others were qualified. The lesion conspicuity scores were significantly higher in HYPER Iterative reconstructions and lower in OSEM2 than in OSEM3 (all P < 0.05). The values of SUVmax, SUVpeakand T/N in HYPER0.3, HYPER0.4 and HYPER0.5 were higher than those in OSEM3. In different reconstructions, there was a correlation between lesion size (median, 1.55 cm; range, 0.7-11.0 cm) and SUVpeakvariation rate compared to OSEM3 (r = 0.388, - 0.515, - 0.495, - 0.464, and - 0.423, respectively, and all P < 0.001).

Conclusion: Considering the image quality and lesion analysis in18F-FDG total-body PET/CT with ultra-low activity injection, OSEM reconstructions with 3 iterations meet the clinical requirements in patients with BMI < 30. In patients with BMI ≥ 30, it is recommended that the HYPER Iterative algorithm (β-value of 0.3-0.5) be used to ensure consistent visual image quality and quantitative assessment.

TITLE: Three-Dimensional β-Amyloid Burden Correlation Between the Eye and Brain in Alzheimer's Disease Mice Using Light-Sheet Fluorescence Microscopy

AUTHORS: Hye Joo Son, Seonok Kim, Seog-Young Kim, Jin Hwa Jung, Suk Hyun Lee, Soo-Jong Kim, Chanwoo Kim, Alice Hahn

JOURNAL: Investigative ophthalmology & visual science

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Recent studies have highlighted the significance of peripheral β-amyloid (Aβ) deposition, identifying the eye as a potential early detection site for Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, previous two-dimensional AD ocular studies have been unable to establish a clear correlation between the three-dimensional Aβ accumulation in the entire eyeball and brain while preserving structural integrity. This study employed a combined brain amyloid positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance (PET/MR) and light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) platform to assess whether the three-dimensionally measured Aβ burden in the eyeball correlates with that in the brain.

Methods: Thirteen eyeballs (6 AD, 7 control) and 17 brains (10 AD, 7 control) were collected from ten 44-week-old 5xFAD and seven control mice. The samples underwent tissue clearing and staining with thioflavin S (Aβ), anti-CD11b (microglia), and anti-ACSA-2 (astrocytes) for LSFM imaging and quantified via 3D surface volume. Standardized uptake value ratios from [18F]Flutemetamol PET/MR were also calculated.

Results: AD eyeballs presented significantly greater plaque-like surface volumes (median, 51,091,002 µm³ [interquartile range, 38,488,272-64,869,828]) than controls (229,293 µm³ [115,863-311,5320]; P = 0.001). AD brains exhibited higher [18F]Flutemetamol uptake and greater plaque-like surface volumes (898,634,368 µm³ [556,263,488-1,105,326,720]) than controls (33,320,178 µm³ [26,842,538-62,716,956]; P < 0.001). A strong positive correlation was observed between the plaque-like surface volumes in the brain and that in the eyeball (r = 0.810, P = 0.001). No significant correlations were found in other morphologic parameters.

Conclusions: Our observation of a strong correlation between the three-dimensional Aβ burden in the whole eyeball and brain advances our understanding of the systemic nature of Aβ pathology and suggests ocular Aβ as a potential independent predictor of brain Aβ burden.

TITLE: Next generation tomosynthesis image acquisition optimization for dedicated PET-DBT attenuation corrections

AUTHORS: Trevor L Vent, Bruno Barufaldi, Raymond J Acciavatti, Srilalan Krishnamoorthy, Suleman Surti, Andrew D A Maidment

JOURNAL: Proceedings of SPIE--the International Society for Optical Engineering

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
A next generation tomosynthesis (NGT) prototype is under development to investigate alternative acquisition geometries for digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT). A positron emission tomography (PET) device will be integrated into the NGT prototype to facilitate DBT acquisition followed immediately by PET acquisition (PET-DBT). The aim of this study was to identify custom acquisition geometries that (1) improve dense/adipose tissue classification and (2) improve breast outline segmentation. Our lab's virtual clinical trial framework (OpenVCT) was used to simulate various NGT acquisitions of anthropomorphic breast phantoms. Five custom acquisition geometries of the NGT prototype, with posteroanterior (PA) x-ray source motion ranging from 40-200 mm in 40 mm steps, were simulated for five phantoms. These acquisition geometries were compared against the simulation of a conventional DBT acquisition geometry. Signal in the reconstruction was compared against the ground truth on a voxel-by-voxel basis. The segmentation of breast from air is performed during reconstruction. Within the breast, we use a threshold-based classification of glandular tissue. The threshold was varied to produce a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, representing the proportion of true fibroglandular classification as a function of the proportion of false fibroglandular classification at each threshold. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was the figure-of-merit used to quantify adipose-glandular classification performance. Reconstructed breast volume estimation and sensitivity index (d') were calculated for all image reconstructions. Volume overestimation is highest for conventional DBT and decreases with increasing PA source motion. AUC andd' increase with increasing PA source motion. These results suggest that NGT can improve PET-DBT attenuation corrections over conventional DBT.

TITLE: Trapezoidal back projection for positron emission tomography reconstruction

AUTHORS: Dóra Varnyú, Krisztián Paczári, László Szirmay-Kalos

JOURNAL: EJNMMI physics

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Background: In the back projection step of the 3D PET reconstruction, all Lines of Responses (LORs) that go through a given voxel need to be identified and included in an integral. The standard Monte Carlo solution to this task samples stochastically the surfaces of the detector crystals and the volume of the voxel to search for valid LORs. To get a low noise Monte Carlo estimate, the number of samples needs to be very high, making the computational cost of the projection significant. In this paper, a novel deterministic projection algorithm called trapezoidal back projection (TBP) is proposed that replaces the extensive Monte Carlo sampling. Its goal is to determine all LORs that contribute to a given voxel together with their exact contribution weights. This is achieved by trapezoidal rasterization and a pre-computed look-up table.

Results: The precision and speed of the proposed TBP algorithm were compared to that of the Monte Carlo back projection of 1000, 10,000 and 100,000 samples. Measurements were run on a National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) NU 4-2008 image quality phantom as well as on a mouse acquisition. Results show that the TBP algorithm achieves the same low noise level (2.5 Uniformity %STD) as the Monte Carlo method with the highest sample number, but 13 times faster-the highest-precision Monte Carlo back projection takes 31.3 s, while TBP takes only 2.3 s on the NEMA NU 4-2008 image quality phantom ofvoxels.

Conclusion: The proposed deterministic TBP algorithm achieves a low noise level in a short runtime, thus it can be a promising solution for the back projection of the 3D PET reconstruction. Its performance advantage could be used to reduce either the reconstruction time, the data acquisition time, or the noise level of the image.

AUTHORS: Elisabeth Pfaehler, Daniela Euba, Andreas Rinscheid, Otto S Hoekstra, Josee Zijlstra, Joyce van Sluis, Adrienne H Brouwers, Constantin Lapa, Ronald Boellaard

JOURNAL: EJNMMI physics

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Background: Machine learning studies require a large number of images often obtained on different PET scanners. When merging these images, the use of harmonized images following EARL-standards is essential. However, when including retrospective images, EARL accreditation might not have been in place. The aim of this study was to develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) that can identify retrospectively if an image is EARL compliant and if it is meeting older or newer EARL-standards.

Materials and methods: 96 PET images acquired on three PET/CT systems were included in the study. All images were reconstructed with the locally clinically preferred, EARL1, and EARL2 compliant reconstruction protocols. After image pre-processing, one CNN was trained to separate clinical and EARL compliant reconstructions. A second CNN was optimized to identify EARL1 and EARL2 compliant images. The accuracy of both CNNs was assessed using fivefold cross-validation. The CNNs were validated on 24 images acquired on a PET scanner not included in the training data. To assess the impact of image noise on the CNN decision, the 24 images were reconstructed with different scan durations.

Results: In the cross-validation, the first CNN classified all images correctly. When identifying EARL1 and EARL2 compliant images, the second CNN identified 100% EARL1 compliant and 85% EARL2 compliant images correctly. The accuracy in the independent dataset was comparable to the cross-validation accuracy. The scan duration had almost no impact on the results.

Conclusion: The two CNNs trained in this study can be used to retrospectively include images in a multi-center setting by, e.g., adding additional smoothing. This method is especially important for machine learning studies where the harmonization of images from different PET systems is essential.

TITLE: Performance of the Iterative OSEM and HYPER Algorithm for Total-body PET at SUVmax with a Low 18F-FDG Activity, a Short Acquisition Time and Small Lesions

AUTHORS: Keyu Zan, Yanhua Duan, Minjie Zhao, Hui Li, Xiao Cui, Leiying Chai, Zhaoping Cheng

JOURNAL: Current medical imaging

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Objective: The primary objective of this comparative investigation was to examine the qualitative attributes of image reconstructions utilizing two distinct algorithms, namely OSEM and HYPER Iterative, in total-body 18F- FDG PET/CT under various acquisition durations and injection activities.

Methods: An initial assessment was executed using a NEMA phantom to compare image quality engendered by OSEM and HYPER Iterative algorithms. Parameters such as BV, COV, and CRC were meticulously evaluated. Subsequently, a prospective cohort study was conducted on 50 patients, employing both reconstruction algorithms. The study was compartmentalized into distinct acquisition time and dosage groups. Lesions were further categorized into three size-based groups. Quantifiable metrics including SD of noise, SUVmax, SNR, and TBR were computed. Additionally, the differences in values, namely &#916;SUVmax, &#916;TBR, %&#916;SUVmax, %&#916;SD, and %&#916;SNR, between OSEM and HYPER Iterative algorithms were also calculated.

Results: The HYPER Iterative algorithm showed reduced BV and COV compared to OSEM in the phantom study, with constant acquisition time. In the clinical study, lesion SUVmax, TBR, and SNR were significantly elevated in images reconstructed using the HYPER Iterative algorithm in comparison to those generated by OSEM (p &#60; 0.001). Furthermore, an amplified increase in SUVmaxwas predominantly discernible in lesions with dimensions less than 10 mm. Metrics such as %&#916;SNR and %&#916;SD in HYPER Iterative exhibited improvements correlating with reduced acquisition times and dosages, wherein a more pronounced degree of enhancement was observable in both &#916;SUVmaxand &#916;TBR.

Conclusion: The HYPER Iterative algorithm significantly improves SUVmaxand reduces noise level, with particular efficacy in lesions measuring ≤ 10 mm and under conditions of abbreviated acquisition times and lower dosages.

JOURNAL: ArXiv

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
X-ray computed tomography (CT) in PET/CT is commonly operated with a single energy, resulting in a limitation of lacking tissue composition information. Dual-energy (DE) spectral CT enables material decomposition by using two different x-ray energies and may be combined with PET for improved multimodality imaging, but would either require hardware upgrade or increase radiation dose due to the added second x-ray CT scan. Recently proposed PET-enabled DECT method allows dual-energy spectral imaging using a conventional PET/CT scanner without the need for a second x-ray CT scan. A gamma-ray CT (gCT) image at 511 keV can be generated from the existing time-of-flight PET data with the maximum-likelihood attenuation and activity (MLAA) approach and is then combined with the low-energy x-ray CT image to form dual-energy spectral imaging. To improve the image quality of gCT, a kernel MLAA method was further proposed by incorporating x-ray CT as a priori information. The concept of this PET-enabled DECT has been validated using simulation studies, but not yet with 3D real data. In this work, we developed a general open-source implementation for gCT reconstruction from PET data and use this implementation for the first real data validation with both a physical phantom study and a human subject study on a uEXPLORER total-body PET/CT system. These results have demonstrated the feasibility of this method for spectral imaging and material decomposition.

JOURNAL: EJNMMI physics

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Background: Accurate image-derived input function (IDIF) from highly sensitive large axial field of view (LAFOV) PET/CT scanners could avoid the need of invasive blood sampling for kinetic modelling. The aim is to validate the use of IDIF for two kinds of tracers, 3 different IDIF locations and 9 different reconstruction settings.

Methods: Eight [18F]FDG and 10 [18F]DPA-714 scans were acquired respectively during 70 and 60 min on the Vision Quadra PET/CT system. PET images were reconstructed using various reconstruction settings. IDIFs were taken from ascending aorta (AA), descending aorta (DA), and left ventricular cavity (LV). The calibration factor (CF) extracted from the comparison between the IDIFs and the manual blood samples as reference was used for IDIFs accuracy and precision assessment. To illustrate the effect of various calibrated-IDIFs on Patlak linearization for [18F]FDG and Logan linearization for [18F]DPA-714, the same target time-activity curves were applied for each calibrated-IDIF.

Results: For [18F]FDG, the accuracy and precision of the IDIFs were high (mean CF ≥ 0.82, SD ≤ 0.06). Compared to the striatum influx (Ki) extracted using calibrated AA IDIF with the updated European Association of Nuclear Medicine Research Ltd. standard reconstruction (EARL2), Kimean differences were < 2% using the other calibrated IDIFs. For [18F]DPA714, high accuracy of the IDIFs was observed (mean CF ≥ 0.86) except using absolute scatter correction, DA and LV (respectively mean CF = 0.68, 0.47 and 0.44). However, the precision of the AA IDIFs was low (SD ≥ 0.10). Compared to the distribution volume (VT) in a frontal region obtained using calibrated continuous arterial sampler input function as reference, VTmean differences were small using calibrated AA IDIFs (for example VTmean difference = -5.3% using EARL2), but higher using calibrated DA and LV IDIFs (respectively + 12.5% and + 19.1%).

Conclusions: For [18F]FDG, IDIF do not need calibration against manual blood samples. For [18F]DPA-714, AA IDIF can replace continuous arterial sampling for simplified kinetic quantification but only with calibration against arterial blood samples. The accuracy and precision of IDIF from LAFOV PET/CT system depend on tracer, reconstruction settings and IDIF VOI locations, warranting careful optimization.

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: The liver is a common site for metastatic disease, which is a challenging and life-threatening condition with a grim prognosis and outcome. We propose a standardized workflow for the diagnosis of oligometastatic disease (OMD), as a gold standard workflow has not been established yet. The envisioned workflow comprises the acquisition of a multimodal image data set, novel image processing techniques, and cone beam computed tomography (CBCT)-guided biopsy for subsequent molecular subtyping. By combining morphological, molecular, and functional information about the tumor, a patient-specific treatment planning is possible. We designed and manufactured an abdominal liver phantom that we used to demonstrate multimodal image acquisition, image processing, and biopsy of the OMD diagnosis workflow.

Methods: The anthropomorphic abdominal phantom contains a rib cage, a portal vein, lungs, a liver with six lesions, and a hepatic vessel tree. This phantom incorporates three different lesion types with varying visibility under computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography CT (PET-CT), which reflects clinical reality. The phantom is puncturable and the size of the corpus and the organs is comparable to those of a real human abdomen. By using several modern additive manufacturing techniques, the manufacturing process is reproducible and allows to incorporate patient-specific anatomies. As a first step of the OMD diagnosis workflow, a preinterventional CT, MRI, and PET-CT data set of the phantom was acquired. The image information was fused using image registration and organ information was extracted via image segmentation. A CBCT-guided needle puncture experiment was performed, where all six liver lesions were punctured with coaxial biopsy needles.

Results: Qualitative observation of the image data and quantitative evaluation using contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) confirms that one lesion type is visible only in MRI and not CT. The other two lesion types are visible in CT and MRI. The CBCT-guided needle placement was performed for all six lesions, including those visible only in MRI and not CBCT. This was possible by successfully merging multimodal preinterventional image data. Lungs, bones, and liver vessels serve as realistic inhibitions during needle path planning.

Conclusions: We have developed a reusable abdominal phantom that has been used to validate a standardized OMD diagnosis workflow. Utilizing the phantom, we have been able to show that a multimodal imaging pipeline is advantageous for a comprehensive detection of liver lesions. In a CBCT-guided needle placement experiment we have punctured lesions that are invisible in CBCT using registered preinterventional MRI scans for needle path planning.

TITLE: Virtual magnetic resonance lumbar spine images generated from computed tomography images using conditional generative adversarial networks

AUTHORS: M Gotoh, T Nakaura, Y Funama, K Morita, D Sakabe, H Uetani, Y Nagayama, M Kidoh, M Hatemura, T Masuda, T Hirai

JOURNAL: Radiography (London, England : 1995)

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Introduction: The aim of this study was to generate virtual Magnetic resonance (MR) from computed tomography (CT) using conditional generative adversarial networks (cGAN).

Methods: We selected examinations from 22 adults who obtained their CT and MR lumbar spine examinations. Overall, 4 examinations were used as test data, and 18 examinations were used as training data. A cGAN was trained to generate virtual MR images from the CT images using the corresponding MR images as targets. After training, the generated virtual MR images from test data in epochs 1, 10, 50, 100, 500, and 1000 were compared with the original ones using the mean square error (MSE) and structural similarity index (SSIM). Additionally, two radiologists also performed qualitative assessments.

Results: The MSE of the virtual MR images decreased as the epoch of the cGANs increased from the original CT images: 8876.7 ± 1192.9 (original CT), 1567.5 ± 433.9 (Epoch 1), 1242.4 ± 442.0 (Epoch 10), 1065.8 ± 478.1 (Epoch 50), 1276.1 ± 718.9 (Epoch 100), 1046.7 ± 488.2 (Epoch 500), and 1031.7 ± 400.0 (Epoch 1000). No considerable differences were observed in the qualitative evaluation between the virtual MR images and the original ones, except in the structure of the spinal canal.

Conclusion: Virtual MR lumbar spine images using cGANs could be a feasible technique to generate near-MR images from CT without MR examinations for evaluation of the vertebral body and intervertebral disc.

Implications for practice: Virtual MR lumbar spine images using cGANs can offer virtual CT images with sufficient quality for attenuation correction for PET or dose planning in radiotherapy.

TITLE: Evaluation of MR anatomically-guided PET reconstruction using a convolutional neural network in PSMA patients

AUTHORS: Adam Farag, Jin Huang, Andres Kohan, Seyed Ali Mirshahvalad, Adriano Basso Dias, Matthias Fenchel, Ur Metser, Patrick Veit-Haibach

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Background. Recently, approaches have utilized the superior anatomical information provided by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to guide the reconstruction of positron emission tomography (PET). One of those approaches is the Bowsher's prior, which has been accelerated lately with a convolutional neural network (CNN) to reconstruct MR-guided PET in the imaging domain in routine clinical imaging. Two differently trained Bowsher-CNN methods (B-CNN0 and B-CNN) have been trained and tested on brain PET/MR images with non-PSMA tracers, but so far, have not been evaluated in other anatomical regions yet.Methods. A NEMA phantom with five of its six spheres filled with the same, calibrated concentration of 18F-DCFPyL-PSMA, and thirty-two patients (mean age 64 ± 7 years) with biopsy-confirmed PCa were used in this study. Reconstruction with either of the two available Bowsher-CNN methods were performed on the conventional MR-based attenuation correction (MRAC) and T1-MR images in the imaging domain. Detectable volume of the spheres and tumors, relative contrast recovery (CR), and background variation (BV) were measured for the MRAC and the Bowsher-CNN images, and qualitative assessment was conducted by ranking the image sharpness and quality by two experienced readers.Results. For the phantom study, the B-CNN produced 12.7% better CR compared to conventional reconstruction. The small sphere volume (<1.8 ml) detectability improved from MRAC to B-CNN by nearly 13%, while measured activity was higher than the ground-truth by 8%. The signal-to-noise ratio, CR, and BV were significantly improved (p< 0.05) in B-CNN images of the tumor. The qualitative analysis determined that tumor sharpness was excellent in 76% of the PET images reconstructed with the B-CNN method, compared to conventional reconstruction.Conclusions. Applying the MR-guided B-CNN in clinical prostate PET/MR imaging improves some quantitative, as well as qualitative imaging measures. The measured improvements in the phantom are also clearly translated into clinical application.

TITLE: Positron Lymphography via Intracervical 18F-FDG Injection for Presurgical Lymphatic Mapping in Cervical and Endometrial Malignancies

AUTHORS: Jennifer J Mueller, Lawrence T Dauer, Rajmohan Murali, Alexia Iasonos, Neeta Pandit-Taskar, Nadeem R Abu-Rustum, Jan Grimm

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
The presence of metastasis in local lymph nodes (LNs) is a key factor influencing choice of therapy and prognosis in cervical and endometrial cancers; therefore, the exploration of sentinel LNs (SLNs) is highly important. Currently, however, SLN mapping requires LN biopsy for pathologic evaluation, since there are no clinical imaging approaches that can identify tumor-positive LNs in early stages. Staging lymphadenectomy poses risks, such as leg lymphedema or lymphocyst formation. Furthermore, in 80%-90% of patients, the explored LNs are ultimately tumor-free, meaning most patients are unnecessarily subjected to lymphadenectomy.Methods:Current lymphoscintigraphy methods identify only the anatomic location of the SLNs and do not provide information on their tumor status. There are no noninvasive methods to reliably identify metastases in LNs before surgery. We have developed positron lymphography (PLG), a method to detect tumor-positive LNs, in which18F-FDG is injected interstitially into the uterine cervix on the day of surgery, and its rapid transport through the lymphatic vessels to the SLN is then visualized with dynamic PET/CT. We previously showed that PLG was able to identify metastatic LNs in animal models. Here, we present the first results from our pilot clinical trial (clinical trials identifierNCT02285192) in 23 patients with uterine or cervical cancer. On the morning of surgery,18F-FDG was injected into the cervix, followed by an immediate dynamic PET/CT scan of the pelvis and a delayed 1-h whole-body scan.Results:There were 3 (15%) node-positive cases on final pathologic analysis, and all of these LNs (including 1 with a focus of only 80 tumor cells) were identified by PLG. There were 2 (10%) false-positive cases with PLG, in which the final pathology of the corresponding SLNs was negative for tumor.Conclusion:This first-in-humans study of PLG in women with uterine and cervical cancer demonstrates its feasibility and its ability to identify patients with nodal metastases and warrants further evaluation in additional studies.

TITLE: Cranial Reconstruction for Infiltrative Meningioma Using 68Ga-DOTATATE Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography and Individual Patient Solutions CaseDesigner®: A Case Series

AUTHORS: Connor C Jacob, Ludovica Pasquini, Kerry-Ann S Mitchell, Lucas P Carlstrom, Daniel M Prevedello

JOURNAL: Operative neurosurgery (Hagerstown, Md.)

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Background and objectives: Meningioma with bone involvement presents challenges for complete resection and cranial reconstruction. 68Ga-dodecanetetreaacetic acid tyrosine-3-octreotide (DOTATATE) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) has emerged as an excellent modality for localizing invasive meningiomas because of molecular interaction with somatostatin receptor-2. We present a novel technique to design 3-dimensional-printed artificial cranioplasty, using combined fine-slice CT, MRI, and 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT with Individual Patient Solutions (IPS) CaseDesigner® software. This study's objective was to generate proof-of-concept work for a novel artificial cranioplasty protocol that combines customized cranial implant software and DOTATATE PET/CT.

Methods: Three patients with invasive bone meningiomas were retrospectively identified. For each patient, the proposed protocol combines CT, MRI, and 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT imaging to generate a 3-dimensional cranial reconstruction within the Karl Leibinger Surgical (KLS) Martin-IPS CaseDesigner® software. Subsequently, the virtual rendering is used to manufacture a customized polyetheretherketone (PEEK) implant, along with a guiding component, which ensures precise delineation of surgical borders before craniectomy. Finally, cranioplasty with the customized implant is performed using standard techniques.

Results: The described preoperative cranioplasty design protocol was performed for each patient. Tumor invasion was visualized using 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT. Patient 1 presented with a recurrent right frontal meningioma with invasion into anterior skull base. In this case, IPS CaseDesigner® was used to create a mirror image PEEK implant for the left orbit and affected cranium. Patients 2 and 3 had intraosseous meningiomas invading the frontal bone; customized PEEK implants were tailored to the side of the planned craniectomy for both patients and were successfully placed without complication. Postoperatively, all patients remained neurologically intact and were discharged without complications. In all patients, the PEEK implants exhibited appropriate cranial continuity and integrity.

Conclusion: 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT has high sensitivity and specificity for detecting meningiomas during preoperative planning, particularly when the tumor involves bone. IPS CaseDesigner® demonstrates excellent utility for planning and constructing customized cranioplasties tailored to each patient for skull reconstruction.

TITLE: Baseline 18F-FDG PET radiomic features as predictors of 2-year event-free survival in diffuse large B cell lymphomas treated with immunochemotherapy

AUTHORS: Nicolas Aide, Christophe Fruchart, Catherine Nganoa, Anne-Claire Gac, Charline Lasnon

JOURNAL: European radiology

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Objectives: To explore the prognostic value of positron emission tomography (PET) radiomic features in the field of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) treated with a first-line immunochemotherapy.

Methods: One-hundred thirty-two patients newly diagnosed with DLBCL were retrospectively included. PET studies were reconstructed using an ordered subset expectation maximisation algorithm with point spread function modelling. The total metabolic tumour volume (MTV) was recorded for each patient, and the volume of interest structure of the largest target lesion was used to compute18F-FDG textural parameters. Data was randomly split into training and validation datasets. Optimal cutoff values were determined by means of 2-year event-free survival (EFS) ROC analyses. Two-year EFS analyses were performed using Kaplan-Meier survival analyses and univariable and multivariable Cox regression models.

Results: The median follow-up was 27 months, and the 2-year event-free survival (2y-EFS) was 77.3% in the entire population. ROC analyses for the 2y-EFS reached statistical significance for total MTV as well as four second-order metrics (homogeneity, contrast, correlation, dissimilarity) and five third-order metrics (LZE (Long-Zone Emphasis), LZLGE (Long-Zone Low-Grey Level Emphasis), LZHGE (Long-Zone High-Grey Level Emphasis), GLNU (Grey-Level Non-Uniformity) and ZP (Zone Percentage)). LZHGE displayed the highest ROC analysis accuracy (acc. = 0.76) and the best discriminant value on univariable Kaplan-Meier analysis (p < 0.0001, HR = 4.54). On multivariable analysis, including IPIaa, total MTV and LZHGE, LZHGE was the only independent predictor of 2y-EFS. These results were confirmed on the validation dataset.

Conclusions: Baseline18F-FDG PET heterogeneity of the largest lymphoma lesion is a promising predictor of 2y-EFS in newly diagnosed DLBCL treated with immunochemotherapy.

Key points: •18F-FDG metabolic heterogeneity emerges as a new tool for survival prognostication of patients and has been explored in many solid tumours with promising results. • Baseline18F-FDG PET heterogeneity of the largest lymphoma lesion is an independent predictor of 2y-EFS in newly diagnosed DLBCL treated with immunochemotherapy. • DLBCL patients presenting with a heterogeneous tumour displayed a worse prognosis.

TITLE: PET Image Quality Improvement for Simultaneous PET/MRI with a Lightweight MRI Surface Coil

AUTHORS: Timothy W Deller, Nicholas K Mathew, Samuel A Hurley, Chad M Bobb, Alan B McMillan

JOURNAL: Radiology

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Background During simultaneous PET/MRI, flexible MRI surface coils that lay on the patient are often omitted from PET attenuation correction processing, leading to quantification bias in PET images. Purpose To identify potential PET image quality improvement by using a recently developed lightweight MRI coil technology for the anterior array (AA) surface coil in both a phantom and in vivo study. Materials and Methods A phantom study and a prospective in vivo study were performed with a PET/CT scanner under three conditions:(a)no MRI surface coil (standard of reference),(b)traditional AA coil, and(c)lightweight AA coil. AA coils were not used in attenuation correction processing to emulate clinical PET/MRI. For the phantom study, PET images were reconstructed with and without time of flight (TOF) to assess quantification accuracy and uniformity. The in vivo study consisted of 10 participants (mean age, 66 years ± 10 [standard deviation]; six men) referred for a PET/CT oncologic examination who had undergone imaging between October 2019 and February 2020. Assessment of image quantification bias (defined as the standard error of the mean values) was conducted by comparing mean liver region of interest standardized uptake values with the no-coil standard of reference. A Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to establish significance. Results For TOF and non-TOF, respectively, the phantom study revealed a mean PET quantification bias of -9.0% and -8.6% with the traditional AA coil and a mean PET quantification bias of -4.3% and -4.0% with the lightweight AA coil. The coefficients of variation reduced from 4.3% and 6.2% with the traditional AA coil to 2.1% and 2.7% with the lightweight AA coil, which demonstrated a homogeneity benefit from the lightweight coil that was greater with, versus without, TOF reconstruction. For the in vivo study, the mean liver standardized uptake value error was -5.9% with the traditional AA coil (P= .002 vs no coil) and -2.4% with the lightweight AA coil (P= .004 vs no coil). Conclusion The lightweight anterior array coil reduced PET image quantification bias by more than 50% compared with the traditional coil. Using the lightweight coil and performing time of flight-based reconstruction each reduced the variation of error. © RSNA, 2020Online supplemental material is available for this article.

TITLE: Evaluation of the Small-animal Nano Scan PET/CT System using 89Zr

AUTHORS: Khalid Alzimami, Sitah Alanazi, Magdi Gannam, Ahmad Alanazi, Ibrahim Aljamaz, Suliman Alyanbawi, Basem Alotaibi, Yousif Almalki, Abdelmoneim Sulieman, Salem Sassi

JOURNAL: Current medical imaging

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Introduction: The purpose of the present work was to evaluate the imaging characteristics of89Zr-PET in comparison with those obtained using fluorine-18 Fluorodeoxyglucose (18FFDG) PET (a gold standard tracer in PET imaging) using a small-animal NanoScan PET/CT scanner.

Methods: The system's spatial resolution, sensitivity, uniformity, and image quality were measured on a Nano Scan small-animal PET/CT scanner according to the NEMA NU4-2008 protocols. For reconstruction images, we used 2D and 3D reconstruction algorithms. The reconstruction methods included filter back projection (FBP), the ordered subsets expectation maximization (OSEM) algorithm, and the 3D Tera-Tomo algorithm, which are developed for the NanoScan small-animal PET/CT scanner.

Results: The results obtained showed a significant difference in the spatial resolution for89Zr as compared to 22Na and 18F when using a 2D reconstruction algorithm. The spatial resolution values were much enhanced by using the 3D Tera-Tomo reconstruction for each isotope, the Full width at half maximum (FWHM) values was less than 1 for all isotopes at the center of the field of view (FOV). This difference in spatial resolution is dependent on the positron range, energy, and the reconstruction method.

Conclusion: The long half-life of89Zr makes it an ideal positron emitter for performing immuno- PET, which is matched with the biological half-life of intact mAbs.89Zr can also give several advantages over other long half-life positron emitters in relation to the overall imaging performance because of its relatively short positron range and simpler decay scheme. The values of89Zr sensitivity that were obtained in the present study were less than those of previous studies.

TITLE: Validation of a discovery MI 4-ring model according to the NEMA NU 2-2018 standards: from Monte Carlo simulations to clinical-like reconstructions

AUTHORS: Antoine Merlet, Benoît Presles, Kuan-Hao Su, Julien Salvadori, Farzam Sayah, Hanieh Jozi, Alexandre Cochet, Jean-Marc Vrigneaud

JOURNAL: EJNMMI physics

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Background: We propose a comprehensive evaluation of a Discovery MI 4-ring (DMI) model, using a Monte Carlo simulator (GATE) and a clinical reconstruction software package (PET toolbox). The following performance characteristics were compared with actual measurements according to NEMA NU 2-2018 guidelines: system sensitivity, count losses and scatter fraction (SF), coincidence time resolution (CTR), spatial resolution (SR), and image quality (IQ). For SR and IQ tests, reconstruction of time-of-flight (TOF) simulated data was performed using the manufacturer's reconstruction software.

Results: Simulated prompt, random, true, scatter and noise equivalent count rates closely matched the experimental rates with maximum relative differences of 1.6%, 5.3%, 7.8%, 6.6%, and 16.5%, respectively, in a clinical range of less than 10 kBq/mL. A 3.6% maximum relative difference was found between experimental and simulated sensitivities. The simulated spatial resolution was better than the experimental one. Simulated image quality metrics were relatively close to the experimental results.

Conclusions: The current model is able to reproduce the behaviour of the DMI count rates in the clinical range and generate clinical-like images with a reasonable match in terms of contrast and noise.

TITLE: CONN-NLM: A Novel CONNectome-Based Non-local Means Filter for PET-MRI Denoising

AUTHORS: Zhuopin Sun, Steven Meikle, Fernando Calamante

JOURNAL: Frontiers in neuroscience

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Background: Advancements in hybrid positron emission tomography-magnetic resonance (PET-MR) systems allow for combining the advantages of each modality. Integrating information from MRI and PET can be valuable for diagnosing and treating neurological disorders. However, combining diffusion MRI (dMRI) and PET data, which provide highly complementary information, has rarely been exploited in image post-processing. dMRI has the ability to investigate the white matter pathways of the brain through fibre tractography, which enables comprehensive mapping of the brain connection networks (the "connectome"). Novel methods are required to combine information present in the connectome and PET to increase the full potential of PET-MRI.

Methods: We developed a CONNectome-based Non-Local Means (CONN-NLM) filter to exploit synergies between dMRI-derived structural connectivity and PET intensity information to denoise PET images. PET-MR data are parcelled into a number of regions based on a brain atlas, and the inter-regional structural connectivity is calculated based on dMRI fibre-tracking. The CONN-NLM filter is then implemented as a post-reconstruction filter by combining the nonlocal means filter and a connectivity-based cortical smoothing. The effect of this approach is to weight voxels with similar PET intensity and highly connected voxels higher when computing the weighted-average to perform more informative denoising. The proposed method was first evaluated using a novel computer phantom framework to simulate realistic hybrid PET-MR images with different lesion scenarios. CONN-NLM was further assessed with clinical dMRI and tau PET examples.

Results: The results showed that CONN-NLM has the capacity to improve the overall PET image quality by reducing noise while preserving lesion contrasts, and it outperformed a range of filters that did not use dMRI information. The simulations demonstrate that CONN-NLM can handle various lesion contrasts consistently, as well as lesions with different levels of inter-connectivity.

Conclusion: CONN-NLM has unique advantages of providing more informative and accurate PET smoothing by adding complementary structural connectivity information from dMRI, representing a new avenue to exploit synergies between MRI and PET.

AUTHORS: Daniele Panetta, Maria Angela Guzzardi, Federica La Rosa, Federico Granziera, Domiziana Terlizzi, Claudia Kusmic, Patricia Iozzo

JOURNAL: Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Positron emission tomography (PET) and computed tomography (CT) are among the most employed diagnostic imaging techniques, and both serve in understanding cardiac function and metabolism. In preclinical research, dedicated scanners with high sensitivity and high spatio-temporal resolution are employed, designed to cope with the demanding technological requirements posed by the small heart size and very high heart rates of mice and rats. In this paper, a bimodal cardiac PET/CT imaging protocol for experimental mouse and/or rat models of cardiac diseases is described, from animal preparation and image acquisition and reconstruction to image processing and visualization. In particular, the18F-labeled fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]FDG)-PET scan allows for the measurement and visualization of glucose metabolism in the different segments of the left ventricle (LV). Polar maps are convenient tools to display this information. The CT part consists of a time-resolved 3D reconstruction of the entire heart (4D-CT) using retrospective gating without electrocardiography (ECG) leads, allowing the morphofunctional evaluation of the LV and the subsequent quantification of the most important cardiac function parameters, such as ejection fraction (EF) and stroke volume (SV). Using an integrated PET/CT scanner, this protocol can be executed within the same anesthesia induction without the need to reposition the animal between different scanners. Hence, PET/CT can be seen as a comprehensive tool for the morphofunctional and metabolic evaluation of the heart in several small animal models of cardiac diseases.

JOURNAL: Nuklearmedizin. Nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Nuclear imaging techniques such as positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in combination with computed tomography (CT) are established imaging modalities in clinical practice, particularly for oncological problems. Due to a multitude of manufacturers, different measurement protocols, local demographic or clinical workflow variations as well as various available reconstruction and analysis software, very heterogeneous datasets are generated. This review article examines the current state of interoperability and harmonisation of image data and related clinical data in the field of nuclear medicine. Various approaches and standards to improve data compatibility and integration are discussed. These include, for example, structured clinical history, standardisation of image acquisition and reconstruction as well as standardised preparation of image data for evaluation. Approaches to improve data acquisition, storage and analysis will be presented. Furthermore, approaches are presented to prepare the datasets in such a way that they become usable for projects applying artificial intelligence (AI) (machine learning, deep learning, etc.). This review article concludes with an outlook on future developments and trends related to AI in nuclear medicine, including a brief research of commercial solutions.

TITLE: High concordance of PET-CT treatment response evaluation according to PERCIST 1.0 when comparing images reconstructed with OSEM vs. BSREM

AUTHORS: Tilda Skoglund, David Minarik, Lars Edenbrandt, Elin Trägårdh

JOURNAL: Clinical physiology and functional imaging

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Background: Positron emission tomography (PET) response criteria in solid tumours (PERCIST 1.0) is a systematic assessment of therapy response with fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]FDG) PET. The ordered subset expectation maximization (OSEM) and block sequential regularized expectation maximization (BSREM) reconstruction algorithms are both commonly used. The impact of using OSEM or BSREM on PERCIST 1.0 is not fully determined. This study aimed to compare treatment response evaluation between the reconstructions OSEM and BSREM according to PERCIST 1.0.

Methods: The highest peak standardized uptake value corrected for lean body mass (SULpeak) in a lesion were measured in PET-CT scans from 90 patients with metastatic breast cancer or malignant melanoma, who had undergone two [18F]FDG PET with computer tomography (CT) scans for treatment evaluation purpose. SUL measurements in the reference organ were also calculated. All scans were reconstructed with OSEM and BSREM. Bland Altman plots and Spearman correlation coefficient were used for comparing measurements obtained from OSEM and BSREM images. Patients were categorized as a complete metabolic response (CMR), partial metabolic response (PMR), stable metabolic disease (SMD), or progressive metabolic disease (PMD).

Results: The mean standard deviation (SD) of SULmeanin the reference organ was slightly lower for BSREM images, resulting in a slightly lower threshold. Lesion SULpeakwas slightly higher for BSREM images compared with OSEM images. Only 5 out of 90 patients had different response evaluations for the different reconstructions.

Conclusion: PERCIST 1.0 serves as a robust response evaluation criterion and is only marginally dependent on the reconstruction used.

TITLE: Positron Range Corrections and Denoising Techniques for Gallium-68 PET Imaging: A Literature Review

AUTHORS: Prodromos Gavriilidis, Michel Koole, Salvatore Annunziata, Felix M Mottaghy, Roel Wierts

JOURNAL: Diagnostics (Basel, Switzerland)

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Gallium-68 (68Ga) is characterized by relatively high positron energy compared to Fluorine-18 (18F), causing substantial image quality degradation. Furthermore, the presence of statistical noise can further degrade image quality. The aim of this literature review is to identify the recently developed positron range correction techniques for68Ga, as well as noise reduction methods to enhance the image quality of low count68Ga PET imaging. The search engines PubMed and Scopus were employed, and we limited our research to published results from January 2010 until 1 August 2022. Positron range correction was achieved by using either deblurring or deep learning approaches. The proposed techniques improved the image quality and, in some cases, achieved an image quality comparable to18F PET. However, none of these techniques was validated in clinical studies. PET denoising for68Ga-labeled radiotracers was reported using either reconstruction-based techniques or deep learning approaches. It was demonstrated that both approaches can substantially enhance the image quality by reducing the noise levels of low count68Ga PET imaging. The combination of68Ga-specific positron range correction techniques and image denoising approaches may enable the application of low-count, high-quality68Ga PET imaging in a clinical setting.

TITLE: Fully 3D Active Surface with Machine Learning for PET Image Segmentation

AUTHORS: Albert Comelli

JOURNAL: Journal of imaging

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
In order to tackle three-dimensional tumor volume reconstruction from Positron Emission Tomography (PET) images, most of the existing algorithms rely on the segmentation of independent PET slices. To exploit cross-slice information, typically overlooked in these 2D implementations, I present an algorithm capable of achieving the volume reconstruction directly in 3D, by leveraging an active surface algorithm. The evolution of such surface performs the segmentation of the whole stack of slices simultaneously and can handle changes in topology. Furthermore, no artificial stop condition is required, as the active surface will naturally converge to a stable topology. In addition, I include a machine learning component to enhance the accuracy of the segmentation process. The latter consists of a forcing term based on classification results from a discriminant analysis algorithm, which is included directly in the mathematical formulation of the energy function driving surface evolution. It is worth noting that the training of such a component requires minimal data compared to more involved deep learning methods. Only eight patients (i.e., two lung, four head and neck, and two brain cancers) were used for training and testing the machine learning component, while fifty patients (i.e., 10 lung, 25 head and neck, and 15 brain cancers) were used to test the full 3D reconstruction algorithm. Performance evaluation is based on the same dataset of patients discussed in my previous work, where the segmentation was performed using the 2D active contour. The results confirm that the active surface algorithm is superior to the active contour algorithm, outperforming the earlier approach on all the investigated anatomical districts with a dice similarity coefficient of 90.47 ± 2.36% for lung cancer, 88.30 ± 2.89% for head and neck cancer, and 90.29 ± 2.52% for brain cancer. Based on the reported results, it can be claimed that the migration into a 3D system yielded a practical benefit justifying the effort to rewrite an existing 2D system for PET imaging segmentation.

TITLE: Tomographic imaging with Compton PET modules: ideal case and first implementation

AUTHORS: P Peng, M Zhang, N Zeraatkar, J Qi, S R Cherry

JOURNAL: Journal of instrumentation : an IOP and SISSA journal

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
In our previous studies, we demonstrated that the Compton PET module, a layer structure PET detector with side readout, can provide high performance in terms of spatial/energy/timing resolution, as well as high gamma ray detection efficiency. In this study, we investigate how to translate the high performance of the detector module into good quality reconstructed tomographic images. This study is performed using GATE simulation, as well as with physical experiments. Similar detector geometry is used in the simulation and experiment: two identical 4-layer detector modules are placed with face to face distance of 56 mm. In the simulation study, each layer consists of a 1-mm-pitch pixelated crystal array. In the experimental study, each layer is a monolithic crystal, which is virtually binned into 1 mm2cells to group single events according to the gamma ray interaction locations. A customized Derenzo phantom was placed between the two detector modules. By rotating the phantom using a motorized rotary stage, data along lines of response (LORs) at different angles were collected for reconstructing the tomographic image. The same reconstruction algorithm was used for both simulation and experimental studies. The results demonstrate that the simulation study could resolve 0.8 mm rods while the experimental study was able to resolve 1.0 mm rods.

TITLE: Application of a Flexible PET Scanner Combined with 3 T MRI Using Non-local Means Reconstruction: Qualitative and Quantitative Comparison with Whole-Body PET/CT

AUTHORS: Masao Watanabe, Kanae Kawai-Miyake, Yasutaka Fushimi, Takayoshi Ishimori, Aya Nakajima, Michio Yoshimura, Masahiro Kikuchi, Kazuko Ohno, Yuji Nakamoto

JOURNAL: Molecular imaging and biology

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Flexible positron emission tomography (fxPET) employing a non-local means reconstruction algorithm was designed to fit existing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) systems. We aimed to compare the qualitative and quantitative performance of fxPET among fxPET with MR-based attenuation correction (MRAC), fxPET with CT-based attenuation correction (CTAC) using CT as a part of WB PET/CT, and whole-body (WB) PET/CT.

Procedures: Sixteen patients with suspected head and neck cancer underwent 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose WB PET/CT scans, followed by fxPET and 3 T MRI scans. Phantom data were compared among the three datasets. For registration accuracy, we measured the distance between the center of the tumor determined by fxPET and that in MRI. We compared image quality, detection rates, and quantitative values including maximal standardized uptake value (SUVmax), metabolic tumor volume (MTV), total lesion glycolysis (TLG), and tumor-to-muscle ratio (TMR) among the three datasets.

Results: The phantom data in fxPET, except the percent contrast recoveries of 17-mm and 22-mm hot spheres, were inferior to those in WB PET/CT. The mean registration accuracy was 4.4 mm between fxPET using MRAC and MRI. The image quality was comparable between two fxPET datasets, but significantly inferior to WB PET/CT (p < 0.0001). In contrast, detection rates were comparable among the three datasets. SUVmax was significantly higher, and MTV and TLG were significantly lower in the two fxPET datasets compared with the WB PET/CT dataset (p < 0.005). There were no significant differences in SUVmax, MTV, and TLG between the two fxPET datasets or in TMR among the three datasets. All quantitative values had significantly positive correlations.

Conclusions: Compared with WB PET/CT, the phantom data and image quality were inferior in fxPET. However, the results of the detection rates and quantitative values suggested the clinical feasibility of fxPET.

TITLE: A comparison between two image reconstructions on the measures of prostate-specific membrane antigen-positive tumor volume in 18F-PSMA-JK-7-PET/computed tomography

AUTHORS: Dominic Ufton, Jan Heilinger, Katrin S Roth, Matthias Schmidt, Alexander Drzezga, Carsten Kobe

JOURNAL: Nuclear medicine communications

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Objectives: Tumor volume in prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA-TV)-PET/computed tomography (CT) has shown an emerging impact for prognosis and response evaluation in patients with prostate cancer. We evaluated the robustness of different PSMA-TV delineation methods.

Materials and methods: A total of 40 18F-JK-7-PSMA-PET/CT performed on the same scanner were analyzed. PSMA-TV measurements were performed using a standardized uptake value of 4.0 as a fixed threshold (T1), 41% of the single hottest voxel as an adaptive threshold (T2), and a liver-specific threshold (T3) for delineation in two reconstruction methods [four iterations and 12 subsets (R1) and three iterations and 21 subsets while applying a point spread function and a time-of-flight algorithm (R2)]. Differences between the segmentation thresholds in R1 and R2 were gathered and tested for statistical significance.

Results: PSMA-TV differed significantly between R1Tx and R2Tx for individual segmentation thresholds, with PSMA-TV in R2 being significantly smaller than in R1 using the same segmentation method. Comparing the differences in PSMA-TV between R1 and R2 reconstruction between the three separate segmentation thresholds showed significantly larger absolute volume differences for T2 compared with T3 and significantly larger relative volume differences for T2 compared with T1 and T3.

Conclusion: Reconstruction settings greatly influence the measurement of PSMA-TV, regardless of the segmentation threshold chosen; however, our results indicate that the fixed thresholds (T1 and T3) are less susceptible to reconstruction-induced volumetry effects than a relative threshold.

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Current European Association of Nuclear Medicine (EANM) Research Ltd. (EARL) guidelines for the standardisation of PET imaging developed for conventional systems have not yet been adjusted for long axial field-of-view (LAFOV) systems. In order to use the LAFOV Siemens Biograph Vision Quadra PET/CT (Siemens Healthineers, Knoxville, TN, USA) in multicentre research and harmonised clinical use, compliance to EARL specifications for18F-FDG tumour imaging was explored in the current study. Additional tests at various locations throughout the LAFOV and the use of shorter scan durations were included. Furthermore, clinical data were collected to further explore and validate the effects of reducing scan duration on semi-quantitative PET image biomarker accuracy and precision when using EARL-compliant reconstruction settings.

Methods: EARL compliance phantom measurements were performed using the NEMA image quality phantom both in the centre and at various locations throughout the LAFOV. PET data (maximum ring difference (MRD) = 85) were reconstructed using various reconstruction parameters and reprocessed to obtain images at shorter scan durations. Maximum, mean and peak activity concentration recovery coefficients (RC) were obtained for each sphere and compared to EARL standards specifications. Additionally, PET data (MRD = 85) of 10 oncological patients were acquired and reconstructed using various reconstruction settings and reprocessed from 10 min listmode acquisition into shorter scan durations. Per dataset, SUVs were derived from tumour lesions and healthy tissues. ANOVA repeated measures were performed to explore differences in lesion SUVmaxand SUVpeak. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were performed to evaluate differences in background SUVpeakand SUVmeanbetween scan durations. The coefficient of variation (COV) was calculated to characterise noise.

Results: Phantom measurements showed EARL compliance for all positions throughout the LAFOV for all scan durations. Regarding patient data, EARL-compliant images showed no clinically meaningful significant differences in lesion SUVmaxand SUVpeakor background SUVmeanand SUVpeakbetween scan durations. Here, COV only varied slightly.

Conclusion: Images obtained using the Vision Quadra PET/CT comply with EARL specifications. Scan duration and/or activity administration can be reduced up to a factor tenfold without the interference of increased noise.

ABSTRACT:
Background:The outstanding capabilities of modern Positron Emission Tomography (PET) to highlight small tumor lesions and provide pathological function assessment are at peril from image quality degradation caused by respiratory and cardiac motion. However, the advent of the long axial field-of-view (LAFOV) scanners with increased sensitivity, alongside the precise time-of-flight (TOF) of modern PET systems, enables the acquisition of ultrafast time resolution images, which can be used for estimating and correcting the cyclic motion.Methods:0.25 s so-called [18F]FDG PET histo image series were generated in the scope of for detecting respiratory and cardiac frequency estimates applicable for performing device-less data-driven gated image reconstructions. The frequencies of the cardiac and respiratory motion were estimated for 18 patients using Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT) with 20 s and 30 s window segments, respectively.Results:The Fourier analysis provided time points usable as input to the gated reconstruction based on eight equally spaced time gates. The cardiac investigations showed estimates in accordance with the measured pulse oximeter references (p= 0.97) and a mean absolute difference of 0.4 ± 0.3 beats per minute (bpm). The respiratory frequencies were within the expected range of 10-20 respirations per minute (rpm) in 16 out of 18 patients. Using this setup, the analysis of three patients with visible lung tumors showed an increase in tumor SUVmaxand a decrease in tumor volume compared to the non-gated reconstructed image.Conclusions:The method can provide signals that were applicable for gated reconstruction of both cardiac and respiratory motion, providing a potential increased diagnostic accuracy.

TITLE: The need of a system phantom for quantitative hybrid nuclear imaging of PET/CT: A systematic review

AUTHORS: M H Hanafi, N Mohd Noor, F F Ahmad Saad, S H Ramli, F Mohamed, M Musarudin

JOURNAL: The Medical journal of Malaysia

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Introduction: There has already been a rising demand in utilising phantom for hybrid Positron Emission Tomography/ Computed Tomography (PET/CT) scanner of nuclear imaging. This review further clarifies this topic and investigates how the previous research phantoms operated with the need for quantitative hybrid nuclear imaging of PET/CT while providing a relatively high image quality when it was performed. In this article, the necessity of previous and current phantom studies in hybrid nuclear imaging of PET/CT scanners is reviewed.

Methods: PubMed and Google Scholar were systematically searched for the relevant studies by following the PRISMA 2009 checklist. A past decade literature search was conducted from 2010 until November 2020 to secure the relevance of the phantom study. Databases were recruited using keywords such as phantom, quantification, standardisation, harmonisation, image quality, standardised uptake value and multicentre study. However, all keywords were related to PET/CT. All abstracts and eligible full-text articles were screened independently, and finally, the quality assessments of this review were performed.

Results: From the 200 retrieved articles, 80 were rejected after the screening of the abstracts and 35 after reading the full-text. The 20 accepted articles addressed the distribution of phantom types used in selected articles studies which were NEMA (67%), ACR (8%) and others (25%). The articles showed the various experimental studies, either phantom studies (35%) or phantom plus clinical studies (65%). For clinical studies (n = 829), the distribution of prospective studies was (n = 674) and retrospective studies was (n =155). The distribution of phantom pathway application showed the studies focused on 40% of reconstruction protocol studies, 30% of the multicentre and standardisation of accreditation program studies, and 30% of the quantification of uptake values studies.

Conclusions: According to this review, the phantom study have a pivotal role in hybrid nuclear imaging of PET/CT either in technical aspects of the scanners (such as data acquisition and reconstruction protocol) or clinical characteristics of patients. In addition to this, the necessity to identify the suitable system phantoms to use within PET/CT scans by considering the continuous development of new phantom studies are needed. Researchers are encouraged to adopt efforts on phantom quantitative validation, including verification with clinical data of patients.

TITLE: Deep learned triple-tracer multiplexed PET myocardial image separation

AUTHORS: Bolin Pan, Paul K Marsden, Andrew J Reader

JOURNAL: Frontiers in nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Introduction: In multiplexed positron emission tomography (mPET) imaging, physiological and pathological information from different radiotracers can be observed simultaneously in a single dynamic PET scan. The separation of mPET signals within a single PET scan is challenging due to the fact that the PET scanner measures the sum of the PET signals of all the tracers. The conventional multi-tracer compartment modeling (MTCM) method requires staggered injections and assumes that the arterial input functions (AIFs) of each tracer are known.

Methods: In this work, we propose a deep learning-based method to separate triple-tracer PET images without explicitly knowing the AIFs. A dynamic triple-tracer noisy MLEM reconstruction was used as the network input, and dynamic single-tracer noisy MLEM reconstructions were used as training labels.

Results: A simulation study was performed to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework on triple-tracer ([]FDG++[]sestamibi) PET myocardial imaging. The results show that the proposed methodology substantially reduced the noise level compared to the results obtained from single-tracer imaging. Additionally, it achieved lower bias and standard deviation in the separated single-tracer images compared to the MTCM-based method at both the voxel and region of interest (ROI) levels.

Discussion: As compared to MTCM separation, the proposed method uses spatiotemporal information for separation, which improves the separation performance at both the voxel and ROI levels. The simulation study also demonstrates the feasibility and potential of the proposed DL-based method for the application to pre-clinical and clinical studies.

JOURNAL: Scientific reports

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
A clinical implementation of cell-based bone regeneration in combination with scaffold materials requires the development of efficient, controlled and reproducible seeding procedures and a tailor-made bioreactor design. A perfusion system for efficient, homogeneous, and rapid seeding with human adipogenic stem cells in bone substitute scaffolds was designed. Variants concerning medium inlet and outlet port geometry, i.e. cylindrical or conical diffuser, cell concentration, perfusion mode and perfusion rates were simulated in silico. Cell distribution during perfusion was monitored by dynamic [18F]FDG micro-PET/CT and validated by laser scanning microscopy with three-dimensional image reconstruction. By iterative feedback of the in silico and in vitro experiments, the homogeneity of cell distribution throughout the scaffold was optimized with adjustment of flow rates, cell density and perfusion properties. Finally, a bioreactor with a conical diffusor geometry was developed, that allows a homogeneous cell seeding (hoover coefficient: 0.24) in less than 60 min with an oscillating perfusion mode. During this short period of time, the cells initially adhere within the entire scaffold and stay viable. After two weeks, the formation of several cell layers was observed, which was associated with an osteogenic differentiation process. This newly designed bioreactor may be considered as a prototype for chairside application.

TITLE: Super-resolution positron emission tomography by intensity modulation: Proof of concept

AUTHORS: Youdong Lang, Qingguo Xie, Chien-Min Kao

JOURNAL: ArXiv

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
We investigate a new approach for increasing the resolution of clinical positron emission tomography (PET). It is inspired by the method of super-resolution (SR) structured illumination microscopy (SIM) for overcoming the intrinsic resolution limit in microscopy due to diffraction of light. For implementing the key idea underlying SIM, we propose using a rotating intensity modulator of the radiation beams in front of the stationary PET detector ring to masquerade above-the-bandwidth signals of the projection data into detectable, lower-frequency ones. Then, an SR image whose resolution is above the system's bandwidth due to instrumentation is computed from several such measurements obtained at several rotational positions of the modulator. We formulated an imaging model that relates the SR image to the measurements and implemented an ordered-subsets expectation-maximization algorithm for solving the model. Based on simulation data produced by using an analytic projector, we showed that 0.9~mm sources can be resolved in the SR image obtained from noise-free data when using 4.2~mm detectors. Noisy data were produced either by adding Poisson noise to the noise-free data and by Monte-Carlo simulation. With noisy data, as expected, the SR performance is diminished but the results remain promising. In particular, 1.2~mm sources were resolvable, and the visibility and quantification of small sources are improved despite considerable sensitivity loss incurred by the modulator. Further studies are needed to better understand the theoretical aspects of the proposed approach and for optimizing the design of the modulator and the reconstruction algorithm in the presence of noise.

TITLE: Optimizing reconstruction parameters for quantitative 124I-PET in the presence of therapeutic doses of 131I

AUTHORS: Louise M Fanchon, Bradley J Beattie, Keith Pentlow, Steven M Larson, John L Humm

JOURNAL: EJNMMI physics

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Background: The goal of this work was to determine the quantitative accuracy and optimal reconstruction parameters for124I-PET imaging in the presence of therapeutic levels of131I. In this effort, images were acquired on a GE D710 PET/CT scanner using a NEMA IEC phantom with spheres containing124I and increasing amounts of131I activity in the background. At each activity level, two scans were acquired, one with the phantom centered in the field of view (FOV) and one 11.2 cm off-center. Reconstructions used an ordered subset expectation maximization algorithm with up to 100 iterations of 16 subsets, with and without time-of-flight (TOF) information. Results were evaluated visually and by comparing the124I activity relative to the scan performed in the absence of131I.

Results: 131I within the FOV added to the randoms rate, to dead time, and to pile-up within the detectors. Using our standard clinical reconstruction parameters, the image quality and quantitative accuracy suffered at131I activities above 1.4 GBq. Convergence rates slowed progressively in the presence of increasing amounts of131I for both TOF and nonTOF reconstructions. TOF reconstructions converged more quickly than nonTOF but often towards erroneous concentrations. Iterating nonTOF reconstructions to convergence produced quantitatively accurate images except for the off-center phantom at the very highest level of background131I tested.

Conclusions: This study shows that quantitative PET is feasible in the presence of large amounts of131I. The high randoms fractions resulted in slow reconstruction convergence and negatively impacted TOF corrections and/or the accuracy of TOF information. Therefore, increased iterations and nonTOF reconstructions are recommended.

TITLE: Deep learning model for automatic image quality assessment in PET

AUTHORS: Haiqiong Zhang, Yu Liu, Yanmei Wang, Yanru Ma, Na Niu, Hongli Jing, Li Huo

JOURNAL: BMC medical imaging

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Background: A variety of external factors might seriously degrade PET image quality and lead to inconsistent results. The aim of this study is to explore a potential PET image quality assessment (QA) method with deep learning (DL).

Methods: A total of 89 PET images were acquired from Peking Union Medical College Hospital (PUMCH) in China in this study. Ground-truth quality for images was assessed by two senior radiologists and classified into five grades (grade 1, grade 2, grade 3, grade 4, and grade 5). Grade 5 is the best image quality. After preprocessing, the Dense Convolutional Network (DenseNet) was trained to automatically recognize optimal- and poor-quality PET images. Accuracy (ACC), sensitivity, specificity, receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC), and area under the ROC Curve (AUC) were used to evaluate the diagnostic properties of all models. All indicators of models were assessed using fivefold cross-validation. An image quality QA tool was developed based on our deep learning model. A PET QA report can be automatically obtained after inputting PET images.

Results: Four tasks were generated. Task2 showed worst performance in AUC,ACC, specificity and sensitivity among 4 tasks, and task1 showed unstable performance between training and testing and task3 showed low specificity in both training and testing. Task 4 showed the best diagnostic properties and discriminative performance between poor image quality (grade 1, grade 2) and good quality (grade 3, grade 4, grade 5) images. The automated quality assessment of task 4 showed ACC = 0.77, specificity = 0.71, and sensitivity = 0.83, in the train set; ACC = 0.85, specificity = 0.79, and sensitivity = 0.91, in the test set, respectively. The ROC measuring performance of task 4 had an AUC of 0.86 in the train set and 0.91 in the test set. The image QA tool could output basic information of images, scan and reconstruction parameters, typical instances of PET images, and deep learning score.

Conclusions: This study highlights the feasibility of the assessment of image quality in PET images using a deep learning model, which may assist with accelerating clinical research by reliably assessing image quality.

TITLE: QUALIPAED-A retrospective quality control study evaluating pediatric long axial field-of-view low-dose FDG-PET/CT

AUTHORS: Sabrina Honoré d'Este, Flemming Littrup Andersen, Christina Schulze, Eunice Saxtoft, Barbara Malene Fischer, Kim Francis Andersen

JOURNAL: Frontiers in nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Introduction: Pediatric patients have an increased risk of radiation-induced malignancies due to their ongoing development and long remaining life span. Thus, optimization of PET protocols is an important task in pediatric nuclear medicine. Long axial field-of-view (LAFOV) PET/CT has shown a significant increase in sensitivity, which provides an ideal opportunity for reduction of injected tracer activity in the pediatric population. In this study we aim to evaluate the clinical performance of a 2-[18F]FDG-tracer reduction from 3 MBq/kg to 1.5 MBq/kg on the Biograph Vision Quadra LAFOV PET/CT.

Materials and methods: The first 50 pediatric patients referred for clinical whole-body PET/CT with 1.5 MBq/kg 2-[18F]FDG, were included. A standard pediatric protocol was applied. Five reconstructions were created with various time, filter and iteration settings. Image noise was computed as coefficient-of-variance (COV = SD/mean standardized-uptake-value) calculated from a spherical 20-50 mm (diameter) liver volume-of-interest. Sets of reconstructions were reviewed by one nuclear medicine physicians, who reported image lesions on a pre-defined list of sites. Paired comparison analysis was performed with significance at(Bonferroni corrected).

Results: All reconstructions, except one, achieved a COVmean(0.08-0.15) equal to or lower than current clinical acceptable values (COVref≤ 0.15). Image noise significantly improved with increasing acquisition time, lowering iterations (i) from 6i to 4i (both with five subsets) and when applying a 2 mm Gauss filter (). Significant difference in lesion detection was seen from 150s to 300s and from 150s to 600s (). 99% of all lesions rated as malignant could be found on the 150s reconstruction, while 100% was found on the 300s, when compared to the 600s reconstruction.

Conclusion: Injected activity and scan time can be reduced to 1.5 MBq/kg 2-[18F]FDG with 5 min acquisition time on LAFOV PET/CT, while maintaining clinical performance in the pediatric population. These results can help limit radiation exposure to patients and personnel as well as shorten total scan time, which can help increase patient comfort, lessen the need for sedation and provide individually tailored scans.

TITLE: Ultra-low-dose CT reconstructed with the artificial intelligence iterative reconstruction algorithm (AIIR) in 18F-FDG total-body PET/CT examination: a preliminary study

AUTHORS: Yan Hu, Zhe Zheng, Haojun Yu, Jingyi Wang, Xinlan Yang, Hongcheng Shi

JOURNAL: EJNMMI physics

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: To investigate the feasibility of ultra-low-dose CT (ULDCT) reconstructed with the artificial intelligence iterative reconstruction (AIIR) algorithm in total-body PET/CT imaging.

Methods: The study included both the phantom and clinical parts. An anthropomorphic phantom underwent CT imaging with ULDCT (10mAs) and standard-dose CT (SDCT) (120mAs), respectively. ULDCT was reconstructed with AIIR and hybrid iterative reconstruction (HIR) (expressed as ULDCT-AIIRphantomand ULDCT-HIRphantom), respectively, and SDCT was reconstructed with HIR (SDCT-HIRphantom) as control. In the clinical part, 52 patients with malignant tumors underwent the total-body PET/CT scan. ULDCT with AIIR (ULDCT-AIIR) and HIR (ULDCT-HIR), respectively, was reconstructed for PET attenuation correction, followed by the SDCT reconstructed with HIR (SDCT-HIR) for anatomical location. PET/CT images' quality was qualitatively assessed by two readers. The CTmean, as well as the CT standard deviation (CTsd), SUVmax, SUVmean, and the SUV standard deviation (SUVsd), was recorded. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) were calculated and compared.

Results: The image quality of ULDCT-HIRphantomwas inferior to the SDCT-HIRphantom, but no significant difference was found between the ULDCT-AIIRphantomand SDCT-HIRphantom. The subjective score of ULDCT-AIIR in the neck, chest and lower limb was equivalent to that of SDCT-HIR. Besides the brain and lower limb, the change rates of CTmeanin thyroid, neck muscle, lung, mediastinum, back muscle, liver, lumbar muscle, first lumbar spine and sigmoid colon were -2.15, -1.52, 0.66, 2.97, 0.23, 8.91, 0.06, -4.29 and 8.78%, respectively, while all CTsdof ULDCT-AIIR was lower than that of SDCT-HIR. Except for the brain, the CNR of ULDCT-AIIR was the same as the SDCT-HIR, but the SNR was higher. The change rates of SUVmax, SUVmeanand SUVsdwere within [Formula: see text] 3% in all ROIs. For the lesions, the SUVmax, SUVsdand TBR showed no significant difference between PET-AIIR and PET-HIR.

Conclusion: The SDCT-HIR could not be replaced by the ULDCT-AIIR at date, but the AIIR algorithm decreased the image noise and increased the SNR, which can be implemented under special circumstances in PET/CT examination.

TITLE: Optimisation of the air fraction correction for lung PET/CT: addressing resolution mismatch

AUTHORS: Francesca Leek, Cameron Anderson, Andrew P Robinson, Robert M Moss, Joanna C Porter, Helen S Garthwaite, Ashley M Groves, Brian F Hutton, Kris Thielemans

JOURNAL: EJNMMI physics

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Background: Increased pulmonary [Formula: see text]F-FDG metabolism in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and other forms of diffuse parenchymal lung disease, can predict measurements of health and lung physiology. To improve PET quantification, voxel-wise air fractions (AF) determined from CT can be used to correct for variable air content in lung PET/CT. However, resolution mismatches between PET and CT can cause artefacts in the AF-corrected image.

Methods: Three methodologies for determining the optimal kernel to smooth the CT are compared with noiseless simulations and non-TOF MLEM reconstructions of a patient-realistic digital phantom: (i) the point source insertion-and-subtraction method, [Formula: see text]; (ii) AF-correcting with varyingly smoothed CT to achieve the lowest RMSE with respect to the ground truth (GT) AF-corrected volume of interest (VOI), [Formula: see text]; iii) smoothing the GT image to match the reconstruction within the VOI, [Formula: see text]. The methods were evaluated both using VOI-specific kernels, and a single global kernel optimised for the six VOIs combined. Furthermore, [Formula: see text] was implemented on thorax phantom data measured on two clinical PET/CT scanners with various reconstruction protocols.

Results: The simulations demonstrated that at [Formula: see text] iterations (200 i), the kernel width was dependent on iteration number and VOI position in the lung. The [Formula: see text] method estimated a lower, more uniform, kernel width in all parts of the lung investigated. However, all three methods resulted in approximately equivalent AF-corrected VOI RMSEs (<10%) at [Formula: see text]200i. The insensitivity of AF-corrected quantification to kernel width suggests that a single global kernel could be used. For all three methodologies, the computed global kernel resulted in an AF-corrected lung RMSE <10% at [Formula: see text]200i, while larger lung RMSEs were observed for the VOI-specific kernels. The global kernel approach was then employed with the [Formula: see text] method on measured data. The optimally smoothed GT emission matched the reconstructed image well, both within the VOI and the lung background. VOI RMSE was <10%, pre-AFC, for all reconstructions investigated.

Conclusions: Simulations for non-TOF PET indicated that around 200i were needed to approach image resolution stability in the lung. In addition, at this iteration number, a single global kernel, determined from several VOIs, for AFC, performed well over the whole lung. The [Formula: see text] method has the potential to be used to determine the kernel for AFC from scans of phantoms on clinical scanners.

JOURNAL: Annals of nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Objective: Various motion correction (MC) algorithms for positron emission tomography (PET) have been proposed to accelerate the diagnostic performance and research in brain activity and neurology. We have incorporated MC system-based optical motion tracking into the brain-dedicated time-of-flight PET scanner. In this study, we evaluate the performance characteristics of the developed PET scanner when performing MC in accordance with the standards and guidelines for the brain PET scanner.

Methods: We evaluate the spatial resolution, scatter fraction, count rate characteristics, sensitivity, and image quality of PET images. The MC evaluation is measured in terms of the spatial resolution and image quality that affect movement.

Results: In the basic performance evaluation, the average spatial resolution by iterative reconstruction was 2.2 mm at 10 mm offset position. The measured peak noise equivalent count rate was 38.0 kcps at 16.7 kBq/mL. The scatter fraction and system sensitivity were 43.9% and 22.4 cps/(Bq/mL), respectively. The image contrast recovery was between 43.2% (10 mm sphere) and 72.0% (37 mm sphere). In the MC performance evaluation, the average spatial resolution was 2.7 mm at 10 mm offset position, when the phantom stage with the point source translates to ± 15 mm along the y-axis. The image contrast recovery was between 34.2 % (10 mm sphere) and 66.8 % (37 mm sphere).

Conclusions: The reconstructed images using MC were restored to their nearly identical state as those at rest. Therefore, it is concluded that this scanner can observe more natural brain activity.

TITLE: Validation of CARE kV automated tube voltage selection for PET-CT: PET quantification and CT radiation dose reduction in phantoms

AUTHORS: Natalie A Bebbington, Troels Jørgensen, Erik Dupont, Mille A Micheelsen

JOURNAL: EJNMMI physics

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Background: Applied tube voltage (kilovolts, kV) and tube current (milliampere seconds, mAs) affect CT radiation dose and image quality and should be optimised for the individual patient. CARE kV determines the kV and mAs providing the lowest dose to the patient, whilst maintaining user-defined reference image quality. Given that kV changes affect CT values which are used to obtain attenuation maps, the aim was to evaluate the effect of kV changes on PET quantification and CT radiation dose using phantoms.

Method: Four phantoms ('Lungman', 'Lungman plus fat', 'Esser' and 'NEMA image quality' (NEMA IQ)) containing F-18 sources underwent 1 PET and 5 CT scans, with CARE kV on (automatic kV selection and mAs modulation) and in semi mode with specified tube voltages of 140, 120, 100 and 80 kV (mAs modulation only). A CARE kV image quality reference of 120 kV/50 mAs was used. Impact on PET quantification was determined by comparing measured activity concentrations for PET reconstructions from different CT scans with the reconstruction using the 120 kV reference, and dose (DLP, CTDIvol) differences calculated by comparing doses from all kV settings with the 120 kV reference.

Results: CARE kV-determined optimal tube voltage and CARE kV 'on' dose (DLP) savings compared with the 120 kV reference were: Lungman, 100 kV, 2.0%; Lungman plus fat, 120 kV, 0%; Esser, 100 kV, 9.3%; NEMA IQ, 100 kV, 3.4%. Using tube voltages in CARE kV 'semi' mode which were not advised by CARE kV 'on' resulted in dose increases ≤ 65% compared with the 120 kV reference (greatest difference Lungman plus fat, 80 kV). Clinically insignificant differences in PET activity quantification of up to 0.7% (Lungman, 100 kV, mean measured activity concentration) were observed when using the optimal tube voltage advised by CARE kV. Differences in PET quantification of up to 4.0% (Lungman, 140 kV, maximum measured activity concentration) were found over the full selection of tube voltages in semi mode, with the greatest differences seen at the most suboptimal kV for each phantom. However, most differences were within 1%.

Conclusions: CARE kV on can provide CT radiation dose savings without concern over changes in PET quantification.

TITLE: HYPR4D kernel method on TOF PET data with validations including image-derived input function

AUTHORS: Ju-Chieh Kevin Cheng, Connor W J Bevington, Vesna Sossi

JOURNAL: EJNMMI physics

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Background: Positron emission tomography (PET) images are typically noisy especially in dynamic imaging where the PET data are divided into a number of short temporal frames often with a low number of counts. As a result, image features such as contrast and time-activity curves are highly variable. Noise reduction in PET is thus essential. Typical noise reduction methods tend to not preserve image features/patterns (e.g. contrast and size dependent) accurately. In this work, we report the first application of our HYPR4D kernel method on time-of-flight (TOF) PET data (i.e. PSF-HYPR4D-K-TOFOSEM). The proposed HYPR4D kernel method makes use of the mean 4D high frequency features and inconsistent noise patterns over OSEM subsets as well as the low noise property of the early reconstruction updates to achieve prior-free de-noising. The method was implemented and tested on the GE SIGNA PET/MR and was compared to the TOF reconstructions with PSF resolution modeling available on the system, namely PSF-TOFOSEM with and without standard post filter and PSF-TOFBSREM (TOF Q.Clear) with various beta values (regularization strengths).

Results: Results from experimental contrast phantom and human subject data with various PET tracers showed that the proposed method provides more robust and accurate image features compared to other regularization methods. The preservation of contrast for the PSF-HYPR4D-K-TOFOSEM was observed to be better and less dependent on the contrast and size of the target structures as compared to TOF Q.Clear and PSF-TOFOSEM with filter. At the same contrast level, PSF-HYPR4D-K-TOFOSEM achieved better 4D noise suppression than other methods (e.g. >2 times lower noise than TOF Q.Clear at the highest contrast). We also present a novel voxel search method to obtain an image-derived input function (IDIF) and demonstrate that the obtained IDIF is the most quantitative w.r.t. the measured blood samples when the acquired data are reconstructed with PSF-HYPR4D-K-TOFOSEM.

Conclusions: The overall results support superior performance of the PSF-HYPR4D-K-TOFOSEM for TOF PET data and demonstrate that the proposed method is likely suitable for all imaging tasks including the generation of IDIF without requiring any prior information as well as further improving the effective sensitivity of the imaging system.

TITLE: A position-adaptive noise-reduction method using a deep denoising filter bank for dedicated breast positron emission tomography images

AUTHORS: Masahiro Tsukijima, Atsushi Teramoto, Akihiro Kojima, Osamu Yamamuro, Tsuneo Tamaki, Hiroshi Fujita

JOURNAL: Physical and engineering sciences in medicine

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Dedicated breast positron emission tomography (db-PET) is more sensitive than whole-body positron emission tomography and is thus expected to detect early stage breast cancer and determine treatment efficacy. However, it is challenging to decrease the sensitivity of the chest wall side at the edge of the detector, resulting in a relative increase in noise and a decrease in detectability. Longer acquisition times and injection of larger amounts of tracer improve image quality but increase the burden on the patient. Therefore, this study aimed to improve image quality via reconstruction with shorter acquisition time data using deep learning, which has recently been widely used as a noise reduction technique. In our proposed method, a multi-adaptive denoising filter bank structure was introduced by training the training data separately for each detector area because the noise characteristics of db-PET images vary at different locations. Input and ideal images were reconstructed based on 1- and 7-min collection data, respectively, using list mode data. The deep learning model used residual learning with an encoder-decoder structure. The image quality of the proposed method was superior to that of existing noise reduction filters such as Gaussian filters and nonlocal mean filters. Furthermore, there was no significant difference between the maximum standardized uptake values before and after filtering using the proposed method. Taken together, the proposed method is useful as a noise reduction filter for db-PET images, as it can reduce the patient burden, scan time, and radiotracer amount in db-PET examinations.

TITLE: Quality Assessment in FDG-PET/CT Imaging of Head-and-Neck Cancer: One Home Run Is Better Than Two Doubles

AUTHORS: Tim Van den Wyngaert, Stijn De Schepper, Laurens Carp

JOURNAL: Frontiers in oncology

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) is indicated in head-and-neck cancer for the initial workup when clinically indicated (e. g., large tumors, clinically positive neck, cervical adenopathy from an unknown primary, etc.), for the assessment of treatment response 12 weeks after completion of (chemo)radiotherapy, and during follow-up when there is suspicion of relapse. The successful implementation of FDG-PET/CT in routine clinical practice requires an in-depth understanding of the recent advances in physics and engineering that have significantly improved the imaging capabilities of PET/CT scanners (e.g., digital silicon photomultipliers, point-spread function modeling, and time-of-flight, and Bayesian penalized likelihood reconstruction). Moreover, a coordinated harmonization effort from professional societies (e.g., EANM) and international bodies (e.g., IAEA) has resulted in the creation of quality assurance frameworks (e.g., QUANUM, EARL, GMP) and guidelines that collectively cover the entire spectrum from tracer production, hardware calibration, patient preparation, and scan acquisition, to image interpretation (e.g., PERCIST, Hopkins criteria). The ultimate goal is to standardize the PET/CT technique and to guarantee accurate and reproducible imaging results for every patient. This review summarizes the recent technical breakthroughs in PET/CT scan design and describes the existing quality assessment frameworks with a focus on applications in head-and-neck cancer. Strict adherence to these harmonization efforts will enable leveraging the full potential of PET/CT and translate the proven benefits of this technique into tangible improvements in outcome for patients with head-and-neck cancer in routine clinical care.

TITLE: Fast Energy Dependent Scatter Correction for List-Mode PET Data

AUTHORS: Juan Manuel Álvarez-Gómez, Joaquín Santos-Blasco, Laura Moliner Martínez, María José Rodríguez-Álvarez

JOURNAL: Journal of imaging

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Improvements in energy resolution of modern positron emission tomography (PET) detectors have created opportunities to implement energy-based scatter correction algorithms. Here, we use the energy information of auxiliary windows to estimate the scatter component. Our method is directly implemented in an iterative reconstruction algorithm, generating a scatter-corrected image without the need for sinograms. The purpose was to implement a fast energy-based scatter correction method on list-mode PET data, when it was not possible to use an attenuation map as a practical approach for the scatter degradation. The proposed method was evaluated using Monte Carlo simulations of various digital phantoms. It accurately estimated the scatter fraction distribution, and improved the image contrast in the simulated studied cases. We conclude that the proposed scatter correction method could effectively correct the scattered events, including multiple scatters and those originated in sources outside the field of view.

TITLE: Method to determine the statistical technical variability of SUV metrics

AUTHORS: Giulia M R De Luca, Jan B A Habraken

JOURNAL: EJNMMI physics

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Background: The Standardized Uptake Value (SUV) Max, SUVMean, and SUVPeak are metrics used to quantify positron emission tomography (PET) images. In order to assess the significance of a change in these metrics for diagnostic purposes, it is relevant to know their variation. The sources of variation can be biological or technical. In this study, we present a method to determine the statistical technical variation of SUV in PET images.

Results: This method was tested on a NEMA quality phantom with spheres of various diameters with a full-length acquisition time of 150 s per bed position and foreground-to-background activity ratio of F18-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) of 10:1. Our method divides the 150 s acquisition into subsets with statistically independent frames of shorter reconstruction length. SUVMax, Mean and Peak were calculated for each reconstructed image in a subset. The coefficient of variation of SUV within each subset has been used to estimate the expected coefficient of variation at 150 s reconstruction length. We report the largest coefficient of variation of the SUV metrics for the smallest sphere and the smallest variation for the largest sphere. The expected variation at 150 s reconstruction length does not exceed 6% for the smallest sphere and 2% for the largest sphere.

Conclusions: With the presented method, we aim to determine the statistical technical variation of SUV. The method enables the evaluation of the effect of SUV metric choice (Max, Mean, Peak) and lesion size on the technical variation and, therefore, to evaluate its relevance on the total variation of the SUV value between clinical studies.

TITLE: Correction of motion tracking errors for PET head rigid motion correction

AUTHORS: Alan Miranda, Tina Kroll, Vanessa Schweda, Steven Staelens, Jeroen Verhaeghe

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Objective. In positron emission tomography (PET) rigid motion correction, erroneous tracking information translates into reduced quality in motion corrected reconstructions. We aim to improve the accuracy of the motion tracking data, to improve the quality of motion corrected reconstructions.Approach. We developed a method for correction of marker/skin displacement over the skull, for tracking methods which require multiple markers attached on the subject head. Additionally, we correct for small magnitude (∼1-2 mm) residual translation tracking errors that can still be present after other corrections. We performed [18F]FDG scans in awake mice (n= 8) and rats (n= 8), and dynamic [18F]SynVesT-1 scans in awake mice (n= 8). Head tracking was performed with the point source tracking method, attaching 3-4 radioactive fiducial markers on the animals' heads. List-mode even-by-event motion correction reconstruction was performed using tracking data obtained from the point source tracking method (MC), tracking data corrected for marker displacement (MC-DC), and tracking data with additional correction for residual translation tracking errors (MC-DCT). Image contrast, and the image enhancement metric (IEM, with MC as reference) were calculated in these 3 reconstructions.Main results. In mice [18F]FDG scans, the contrast increased on average 3% from MC to MC-DC (IEM: 1.01), and 5% from MC to MC-DCT (IEM: 1.02). For mice [18F]SynVesT-1 scans the contrast increased 6% from MC to MC-DC (IEM: 1.03), and 7% from MC to MC-DCT (IEM: 1.05). In rat [18F]FDG scans contrast increased 5% (IEM: 1.04), and 9% (IEM: 1.05), respectively.Significance. The methods presented here serve to correct motion tracking errors in PET brain scans, which translates into improved image quality in motion corrected reconstructions.

TITLE: The Importance of Time-of-Flight Reconstruction and Point Spread Modeling in the Measurement of Myocardial Blood Flow Parameters

AUTHORS: James A Case

JOURNAL: Current cardiology reports

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Purpose of review: Absolute quantitation of myocardial blood flow has been recognized as one of the most important advances in nuclear cardiology. The addition of absolute myocardial blood flow quantitation has had a significant impact on the determination of normalcy, artifact/defect differentiation, and the true extent of coronary artery disease in patients with known or suspected coronary disease. Time-of-flight reconstruction and point spread function modeling of the potential to greatly improve resolution and signal to background. This combined with absolute blood flow measurements could improve the reliability of regional blood flow estimates and overall image quality.

Recent findings: Recent publications have demonstrated that time-of-flight reconstruction can have an impact on the amount of spillover between the blood pool ROI and the myocardial regions. This may necessitate changes to kinetic models; however, these changes if implemented correctly may result in improved accuracy and reproducibility of blood flow estimates. This may also have the benefit of assessing blood flow in the microvasculature using newer F-18 labeled blood flow tracers. Time of flight and point spread function modeling represent significant improvements in the accuracy and quality of reconstructed myocardial perfusion PET images. This may also have significant implications for the reliability of blood flow estimates. To achieve these benefits, attention must be given to blood flow models to ensure that they have been correctly optimized for the scanner-specific time-of-flight reconstruction properties.

TITLE: AI-enhanced PET/CT image synthesis using CycleGAN for improved ovarian cancer imaging

AUTHORS: Amir Hossein Farshchitabrizi, Mohammad Hossein Sadeghi, Sedigheh Sina, Mehrosadat Alavi, Zahra Nasiri Feshani, Hamid Omidi

JOURNAL: Polish journal of radiology

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Ovarian cancer is the fifth fatal cancer among women. Positron emission tomography (PET), which offers detailed metabolic data, can be effectively used for early cancer screening. However, proper attenuation correction is essential for interpreting the data obtained by this imaging modality. Computed tomography (CT) imaging is commonly performed alongside PET imaging for attenuation correction. This approach may introduce some issues in spatial alignment and registration of the images obtained by the two modalities. This study aims to perform PET image attenuation correction by using generative adversarial networks (GANs), without additional CT imaging.

Material and methods: The PET/CT data from 55 ovarian cancer patients were used in this study. Three GAN architectures: Conditional GAN, Wasserstein GAN, and CycleGAN, were evaluated for attenuation correction. The statistical performance of each model was assessed by calculating the mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE). The radiological performance assessments of the models were performed by comparing the standardised uptake value and the Hounsfield unit values of the whole body and selected organs, in the synthetic and real PET and CT images.

Results: Based on the results, CycleGAN demonstrated effective attenuation correction and pseudo-CT generation, with high accuracy. The MAE and MSE for all images were 2.15 ± 0.34 and 3.14 ± 0.56, respectively. For CT reconstruction, such values were found to be 4.17 ± 0.96 and 5.66 ± 1.01, respectively.

Conclusions: The results showed the potential of deep learning in reducing radiation exposure and improving the quality of PET imaging. Further refinement and clinical validation are needed for full clinical applicability.

JOURNAL: Asia Oceania journal of nuclear medicine & biology

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Objectives: We investigated image quality and standardized uptake values (SUVs) for different lesion sizes using clinical data generated by18F-FDG-prone breast silicon photomultiplier (SiPM)-based positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT).

Methods: We evaluated the effect of point-spread function (PSF) modeling and Gaussian filtering (Gau) and determined the optimal reconstruction conditions. We compared the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), contrast, %coefficient of variation (%CV), SUV, and Likert scale score between ordered-subset expectation maximization (OSEM) time-of-flight (TOF) and OSEM+TOF+PSF in phantom and clinical studies. The conventional image was generated with OSEM+TOF_Gau 6 mm. The National Electrical Manufacturers Association body phantom with 10-mm hot sphere data was acquired for 5 min. Twenty-six patients (40 lesions, ranging from 3.7 to 63.0 mm) were examined using prone breast PET/CT with a breast positioner for breast cancer staging. PET data were acquired 125±9.7 min after intravenous injection of 220±16.1 MBq at 5 min/bed.

Results: In the phantom study, a high SNR was obtained from a 3- to 5-mm Gaussian filter for OSEM+TOF+PSF. The contrast obtained with OSEM+TOF without Gaussian filtering was superior to that obtained with OSEM+TOF+PSF_Gau 4 mm. In the clinical study, the image quality depended on lesion size. The average SNR was significantly higher at 40.8% for lesions >20 mm with OSEM+TOF_Gau 6 mm than with OSEM+TOF without Gaussian filtering. The average contrast for lesions ≤10 mm was significantly higher by 42.0% with OSEM+TOF without Gaussian filtering than with OSEM+TOF_Gau 6 mm. The average SUVmaxof OSEM+TOF without Gaussian filtering significantly increased by 53.3% for lesions ≤10 mm.

Conclusion: OSEM+TOF without Gaussian filtering provided good contrast and quantitative value for small lesions.

TITLE: Post-reconstruction enhancement of [18F]FDG PET images with a convolutional neural network

AUTHORS: John Ly, David Minarik, Jonas Jögi, Per Wollmer, Elin Trägårdh

JOURNAL: EJNMMI research

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Background: The aim of the study was to develop and test an artificial intelligence (AI)-based method to improve the quality of [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) images.

Methods: A convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained by using pairs of excellent (acquisition time of 6 min/bed position) and standard (acquisition time of 1.5 min/bed position) or sub-standard (acquisition time of 1 min/bed position) images from 72 patients. A test group of 25 patients was used to validate the CNN qualitatively and quantitatively with 5 different image sets per patient: 4 min/bed position, 1.5 min/bed position with and without CNN, and 1 min/bed position with and without CNN.

Results: Difference in hotspot maximum or peak standardized uptake value between the standard 1.5 min and 1.5 min CNN images fell short of significance. Coefficient of variation, the noise level, was lower in the CNN-enhanced images compared with standard 1 min and 1.5 min images. Physicians ranked the 1.5 min CNN and the 4 min images highest regarding image quality (noise and contrast) and the standard 1 min images lowest.

Conclusions: AI can enhance [18F]FDG-PET images to reduce noise and increase contrast compared with standard images whilst keeping SUVmax/peakstability. There were significant differences in scoring between the 1.5 min and 1.5 min CNN image sets in all comparisons, the latter had higher scores in noise and contrast. Furthermore, difference in SUVmaxand SUVpeakfell short of significance for that pair. The improved image quality can potentially be used either to provide better images to the nuclear medicine physicians or to reduce acquisition time/administered activity.

JOURNAL: EJNMMI physics

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Background: Organs-on-Chips (OOCs), microdevices mimicking in vivo organs, find growing applications in disease modeling and drug discovery. With the increasing number of uses comes a strong demand for imaging capabilities of OOCs as monitoring physiologic processes within OOCs is vital for the continuous improvement of this technology. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) would be ideal for OOC imaging, however, current PET systems are insufficient for this task due to their inadequate spatial resolution. In this work, we propose the concept of an On-Chip PET system capable of imaging OOCs and optimize its design using a Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS).

Material and methods: The proposed system consists of four detectors arranged around the OOC device. Each detector is made of two monolithic LYSO crystals and covered with Silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) on multiple surfaces. We use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained with data from a MCS to predict the first gamma-ray interaction position inside the detector from the light patterns that are recorded by the SiPMs on the detector's surfaces.

Results: The CNN achieves a mean average prediction error of 0.80 mm in the best configuration. The proposed system achieves a sensitivity of 34.81% for 13 mm thick crystals and does not show a prediction degradation near the boundaries of the detector. We use the trained network to reconstruct an image of a grid of 21 point sources spread across the field-of-view and obtain a mean spatial resolution of 0.55 mm. We show that 25,000 Line of Responses (LORs) are needed to reconstruct a realistic OOC phantom with adequate image quality.

Conclusions: We demonstrate that it is possible to achieve a spatial resolution of almost 0.5 mm in a PET system made of multiple monolithic LYSO crystals by directly predicting the scintillation position from light patterns created with SiPMs. We observe that a thinner crystal performs better than a thicker one, that increasing the SiPM size from 3 mm to 6 mm only slightly decreases the prediction performance, and that certain surfaces encode significantly more information for the scintillation-point prediction than others.

TITLE: Improving diagnostic precision in amyloid brain PET imaging through data-driven motion correction

AUTHORS: Hye Lim Park, Sonya Youngju Park, Mingeon Kim, Soyeon Paeng, Eun Jeong Min, Inki Hong, Judson Jones, Eun Ji Han

JOURNAL: EJNMMI physics

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Background: Head motion during brain positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) imaging degrades image quality, resulting in reduced reading accuracy. We evaluated the performance of a head motion correction algorithm using18F-flutemetamol (FMM) brain PET/CT images.

Methods: FMM brain PET/CT images were retrospectively included, and PET images were reconstructed using a motion correction algorithm: (1) motion estimation through 3D time-domain signal analysis, signal smoothing, and calculation of motion-free intervals using a Merging Adjacent Clustering method; (2) estimation of 3D motion transformations using the Summing Tree Structural algorithm; and (3) calculation of the final motion-corrected images using the 3D motion transformations during the iterative reconstruction process. All conventional and motion-corrected PET images were visually reviewed by two readers. Image quality was evaluated using a 3-point scale, and the presence of amyloid deposition was interpreted as negative, positive, or equivocal. For quantitative analysis, we calculated the uptake ratio (UR) of 5 specific brain regions, with the cerebellar cortex as a reference region. The results of the conventional and motion-corrected PET images were statistically compared.

Results: In total, 108 sets of FMM brain PET images from 108 patients (34 men and 74 women; median age, 78 years) were included. After motion correction, image quality significantly improved (p < 0.001), and there were no images of poor quality. In the visual analysis of amyloid deposition, higher interobserver agreements were observed in motion-corrected PET images for all specific regions. In the quantitative analysis, the UR difference between the conventional and motion-corrected PET images was significantly higher in the group with head motion than in the group without head motion (p = 0.016).

Conclusions: The motion correction algorithm provided better image quality and higher interobserver agreement. Therefore, we suggest that this algorithm be adopted as a routine post-processing protocol in amyloid brain PET/CT imaging and applied to brain PET scans with other radiotracers.

TITLE: Image quality assessment along the one metre axial field-of-view of the total-body Biograph Vision Quadra PET/CT system for 18F-FDG

AUTHORS: Ivo Rausch, Julia G Mannheim, Jürgen Kupferschläger, Christian la Fougère, Fabian P Schmidt

JOURNAL: EJNMMI physics

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Aim: Recently, total-body PET/CT systems with an extended axial field-of-view (aFOV) became commercially available which allow acquiring physiologic information of multiple organs simultaneously. However, the nominal aFOV may clinically not be used effectively due to the inherently reduced sensitivity at the distal ends of the aFOV. The aim of this study was to assess the extent of the useful aFOV of the Biograph Vision Quadra PET/CT system.

Methods: A NEMA image quality (IQ) phantom mimicking a standard [18F]FDG examination was used. Image contrast and noise were assessed across the 106 cm aFOV of the Biograph Vision Quadra PET/CT system (Siemens Healthineers). Phantom acquisitions were performed at different axial positions. PET data were rebinned to simulate different acquisition times for a standard injected activity and reconstructed using different filter settings to evaluate the noise and images along the axial direction.

Results: Image noise and contrast were stable within the central 80 cm of the aFOV. Outside this central area, image contrast variability as well as image noise increased. This degradation of IQ was in particular evident for short acquisition times of less than 30 s. At 10 min acquisition time and in the absence of post-reconstruction filtering, the useful aFOV was 100 cm. For a 2 min acquisition time, a useful aFOV with image noise below 15% was only achievable using Gaussian filtering with axial extents of between 83 and 103 cm when going from 2 to 6 mm full-width-half-maximum, respectively.

Conclusion: Image noise increases substantially towards the ends of the aFOV. However, good IQ in compliance with generally accepted benchmarks is achievable for an aFOV of > 90 cm. When accepting higher image noise or using dedicated protocol settings such as stronger filtering a useful aFOV of around 1 m can be achieved for a 2 min acquisition time.

JOURNAL: Frontiers in oncology

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: This study evaluated the effects of new Bayesian penalized likelihood (BPL) reconstruction algorithm on visualization and quantification of upper abdominal malignant tumors in clinical FDG PET/CT examinations, comparing the results to those obtained by an ordered subset expectation maximization (OSEM) reconstruction algorithm. Metabolic tumor volume (MTV) and texture features (TFs), as well as SUV-related metrics, were evaluated to clarify the BPL effects on quantification.

Materials and methods: A total of 153 upper abdominal lesions (82 liver metastatic and 71 pancreatic cancers) were included in this study. FDG PET/CT images were acquired with a GE Discovery 710 scanner equipped with a time-of-flight system. Images were reconstructed using OSEM and BPL (beta 700) algorithms. In 58 lesions <1.5 cm in greatest diameter (small-lesion group), visual image quality of each lesion was evaluated using a four-point scale. SUVmax was obtained for quantitative metrics. Visual scores and SUVmax were compared between OSEM and BPL images. In 95 lesions >2.0 cm in greatest diameter (larger-lesion group), SUVmax, SUVpeak, MTV, and six TFs were compared between OSEM and BPL images. In addition to the size-based analyses, an increase of SUVmax with BPL was evaluated according to the original SUVmax in OSEM images.

Results: In the small-lesion group, both visual score and SUVmax were significantly higher in the BPL than OSEM images. The increase in visual score was observed in 20 (34%) of all 58 lesions. In the larger-lesion group, no statistical difference was observed in SUVmax, SUVpeak, or MTV between OSEM and BPL images. BPL increased high gray-level zone emphasis and decreased low gray-level zone emphasis among six TFs compared to OSEM with statistical significance. No statistical differences were observed in other TFs. SUVmax-based analysis demonstrated that BPL increased and decreased SUVmax in lesions with low (<5) and high (>10) SUVmax in original OSEM images, respectively.

Conclusion: This study demonstrated that BPL improved conspicuity of small or low-count upper abdominal malignant lesions in clinical FDG PET/CT examinations. Only two TFs represented significant differences between OSEM and BPL images of all quantitative metrics in larger lesions.

TITLE: Optimization of the Acquisition Time and Injected Dose of 18 F-Fluorodeoxyglucose Based on Patient Specifications for High-Sensitive Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography Scanner

AUTHORS: Murtadha Al-Fatlawi, Farideh Pak, Saeed Farzanefar, Yalda Salehi, Abbas Monsef, Peyman Sheikhzadeh

JOURNAL: World journal of nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
BackgroundThis study was aimed to optimize the fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-administered dose and scan time based on patient specifications using a highly sensitive five-ring bismuth germanium oxide (BGO)-based positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scanner (Discovery IQ).MethodsWe retrospectively analyzed 101 whole-body18F-FDG PET/CT images. Patient data were reconstructed using ordered subset expectation maximization with resolution recovery algorithms (OSEM + SharpIR). Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was calculated for each patient, standardized to SNRnorm, and plotted against three body index parameters (weight, body mass index, and lean body mass). Two professional physicians blindly examined image quality at different patient time per bed positions to determine the minimum acceptable quality. To select images of acceptable quality, the noise index parameter was also measured. A new dose-time product (DTP) was established for each patient, and a predicted injected dose was assumed.ResultsWe found an almost linear association between patient weight and normalized SNR, and patient weight had the highest R2in the fitting. The redesigned DTP can reduce results by approximately 74 and 38% compared with ordinary DTP for 80- and 160-s scan durations. The new dose regimen formula was found to be DTP =c/t × m1.24, wheremis the patient weight,tis the scan time per bed position, andcis 1.8 and 4.3 for acceptable and higher confidence states, respectively, in Discovery IQ PET/CT.ConclusionPatient weight is the best clinical parameter for the implementation of18F-FDG PET/CT image quality assessment. A new dose-time regimen based on body weight was proposed for use in highly sensitive five-ring BGO PET-CT scanners to significantly reduce the injection dose and scan times while maintaining sufficient image quality for diagnosis.

TITLE: Improved diagnostic accuracy for coronary artery disease detection with quantitative 3D 82Rb PET myocardial perfusion imaging

AUTHORS: Jennifer M Renaud, Alexis Poitrasson-Rivière, Jonathan B Moody, Tomoe Hagio, Edward P Ficaro, Venkatesh L Murthy

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: To establish requirements for normal databases for quantitative rubidium-82 (82Rb) PET MPI analysis with contemporary 3D PET/CT technology and reconstruction methods for maximizing diagnostic accuracy of total perfusion deficit (TPD), a combined metric of defect extent and severity, versus invasive coronary angiography.

Methods: In total, 1571 patients with82Rb PET/CT MPI on a 3D scanner and stress static images reconstructed with and without time-of-flight (TOF) modeling were identified. An additional eighty low pre-test probability of disease (PTP) patients reported as normal were used to form separate sex-stratified and sex-independent iterative and TOF normal databases. 3D normal databases were applied to matched patient reconstructions to quantify TPD. Per-patient and per-vessel performance of 3D versus 2D PET normal databases was assessed with receiver operator characteristic curve analysis. Diagnostic accuracy was evaluated at optimal thresholds established from PTP patients. Results were compared against logistic regression modeling of TPD adjusted for clinical variables, and standard clinical interpretation.

Results: TPD diagnostic accuracy was significantly higher using 3D PET normal databases (per-patient: 80.1% for 3D databases, versus 74.9% and 77.7% for 2D database applied to iterative and TOF images respectively, p < 0.05). Differences in male and female normal distributions for 3D attenuation-corrected reconstructions were not clinically meaningful; therefore, sex-independent databases were used. Logistic regression modeling including TPD demonstrated improved performance over clinical reads.

Conclusions: Normal databases tailored to 3D PET images provide significantly improved diagnostic accuracy for PET MPI evaluation with automated quantitative TPD. Clinical application of these techniques should be considered to support accurate image interpretation.

TITLE: The role of activity, scan duration and patient's body mass index in the optimization of FDG imaging protocols on a TOF-PET/CT scanner

AUTHORS: Roberta Matheoud, Naema Al-Maymani, Alessia Oldani, Gian Mauro Sacchetti, Marco Brambilla, Alessandro Carriero

JOURNAL: EJNMMI physics

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Background: Time-of-flight (TOF) PET technology determines a reduction in the noise and improves the reconstructed image quality in low count acquisitions, such as in overweight patients, allowing a reduction of administered activity and/or imaging time. However, international guidelines and recommendations on the18F-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG) activity administration scheme are old or only partially account for TOF technology and advanced reconstruction modalities. The aim of this study was to optimize FDG whole-body studies on a TOF-PET/CT scanner by using a multivariate approach to quantify how physical figures of merit related to image quality change with acquisition/reconstruction/patient-dependent parameters in a phantom experiment.

Methods: The NEMA-IQ phantom was used to evaluate contrast recovery coefficient (CRC), background variability (BV) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) as a function of changing emission scan duration (ESD), activity concentration (AC), target internal diameter (ID), target-background activity ratio (TBR) and body mass index (BMI). The phantom was filled with an average concentration of 5.3 kBq/ml of FDG solution and the spheres with TBR of 21.2, 8.8 and 5.0 in 3 different sessions. Images were acquired at varying background activity concentration from 5.1 to 1.3 kBq/ml, and images were reconstructed for ESD of 30-151 s per bed position with and without point spread function (PSF) correction. The parameters were all considered in a single analysis using multiple linear regression methods.

Results: As expected, CRC depended only on sphere ID and on PSF application, while BV depended on sphere ID, ESD, AC and BMI of the phantom, in order of decreasing relevance. Noteworthy, ESD and AC resulted as the most significant predictors of CNR variability with a similar relevance, followed by the BMI of the patient and TBR of the lesion.

Conclusions: AC and ESD proved to be effective tools in modulating CNR. ESD could be increased rather than AC to improve image quality in overweight/obese patients to fulfil ALARA principles.

TITLE: Data-Driven Respiratory Gating Outperforms Device-Based Gating for Clinical 18F-FDG PET/CT

AUTHORS: Matthew D Walker, Andrew J Morgan, Kevin M Bradley, Daniel R McGowan

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
A data-driven method for respiratory gating in PET has recently been commercially developed. We sought to compare the performance of the algorithm with an external, device-based system for oncologic18F-FDG PET/CT imaging.Methods:In total, 144 whole-body18F-FDG PET/CT examinations were acquired, with a respiratory gating waveform recorded by an external, device-based respiratory gating system. In each examination, 2 of the bed positions covering the liver and lung bases were acquired with a duration of 6 min. Quiescent-period gating retaining approximately 50% of coincidences was then able to produce images with an effective duration of 3 min for these 2 bed positions, matching the other bed positions. For each examination, 4 reconstructions were performed and compared: data-driven gating (DDG) (we use the termDDG-retroto distinguish that we did not use the real-time R-threshold-based application of DDG that is available within the manufacturer's product), external device-based gating (real-time position management (RPM)-gated), no gating but using only the first 3 min of data (ungated-matched), and no gating retaining all coincidences (ungated-full). Lesions in the images were quantified and image quality scored by a radiologist who was masked to the method of data processing.Results:Compared with the other reconstruction options, DDG-retro increased the SUVmaxand decreased the threshold-defined lesion volume. Compared with RPM-gated, DDG-retro gave an average increase in SUVmaxof 0.66 ± 0.1 g/mL (n= 87,P< 0.0005). Although the results from the masked image evaluation were most commonly equivalent, DDG-retro was preferred over RPM-gated in 13% of examinations, whereas the opposite occurred in just 2% of examinations. This was a significant preference for DDG-retro (P= 0.008,n= 121). Liver lesions were identified in 23 examinations. Considering this subset of data, DDG-retro was ranked superior to ungated-full in 6 of 23 (26%) cases. Gated reconstruction using the external device failed in 16% of examinations, whereas DDG-retro always provided a clinically acceptable image.Conclusion:In this clinical evaluation, DDG-retro provided performance superior to that of the external device-based system. For most examinations the performance was equivalent, but DDG-retro had superior performance in 13% of examinations, leading to a significant preference overall.

TITLE: Activity Dose Reduction in 64Cu-DOTATATE PET in Patients with Neuroendocrine Neoplasms: Impact on Image Quality and Lesion Detection Ability

AUTHORS: Mathias Loft, Esben A Carlsen, Camilla B Johnbeck, Christoffer V Jensen, Flemming L Andersen, Seppo W Langer, Peter Oturai, Ulrich Knigge, Andreas Kjaer

JOURNAL: Molecular imaging and biology

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Patients with neuroendocrine neoplasms (NEN) engage in lifelong follow-up with frequent somatostatin receptor PET, e.g. [64Cu]Cu-DOTATATE PET, and continued measures to reduce radiation exposures should be in pursued in accordance with the as-low-as-reasonably-achievable (ALARA) principle. We therefore aimed to determine the lowest achievable [64Cu]Cu-DOTATATE dose while maintaining image quality and lesion detection rate.

Procedures: We included scans from 38 patients with NEN referred to routine [64Cu]Cu-DOTATATE PET/CT. Using reconstruction of under-sampled PET list-mode data, we simulated [64Cu]Cu-DOTATATE activity dose-reduced PET equivalents with median [range] 142 MBq [127;157], 95 MBq [85;105], and 48 MBq [42;52], corresponding to 75% (PET75%), 50% (PET50%), and 25% (PET25%) of the full-dose 191 MBq [169;209] (PET100%). Three blinded readers independently assessed image quality (scores 1-5), lesion confidence (scores 0-2), and counted lesions grouped by organs and regions. Number of lesions, proportions of patients with diagnostic image quality (reader-median image quality ≥ 4), diagnostic lesion confidence (reader-median lesion confidence ≥ 1), and per-patient sensitivities and specificities for organ-specific disease on PET75-25%were compared with PET100%.

Results: The median [64Cu]Cu-DOTATATE activity dose could be reduced from 191 to 142 MBq without decline in diagnostic image quality (P = 0.62), diagnostic lesion confidence (P = 1.0), or number of lesions detected in major organs or regions (P = 0.19-0.71). Sensitivity and specificity for detection of liver disease were 100% (26/26 patients) and 100% (12/12), respectively, for both PET75%and PET50%. Overall sensitivity for detection of NEN was 100% (26/26) for both PET75%and PET50%, and overall specificities were 92% (11/12) and 100% (12/12) for PET75and PET50, respectively. Following dose-blinded post hoc review, the PET75%specificity was adjusted to 100% (12/12).

Conclusions: The [64Cu]Cu-DOTATATE activity dose can be reduced from 191 MBq to at least 142 MBq without losing image quality or lesion detection ability and further reduced to 95 MBq without loss of clinically relevant information.

TITLE: Signal separation of simultaneous dual-tracer PET imaging based on global spatial information and channel attention

AUTHORS: Jingwan Fang, Fuzhen Zeng, Huafeng Liu

JOURNAL: EJNMMI physics

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Background: Simultaneous dual-tracer positron emission tomography (PET) imaging efficiently provides more complete information for disease diagnosis. The signal separation has long been a challenge of dual-tracer PET imaging. To predict the single-tracer images, we proposed a separation network based on global spatial information and channel attention, and connected it to FBP-Net to form the FBPnet-Sep model.

Results: Experiments using simulated dynamic PET data were conducted to: (1) compare the proposed FBPnet-Sep model to Sep-FBPnet model and currently existing Multi-task CNN, (2) verify the effectiveness of modules incorporated in FBPnet-Sep model, (3) investigate the generalization of FBPnet-Sep model to low-dose data, and (4) investigate the application of FBPnet-Sep model to multiple tracer combinations with decay corrections. Compared to the Sep-FBPnet model and Multi-task CNN, the FBPnet-Sep model reconstructed single-tracer images with higher structural similarity, peak signal-to-noise ratio and lower mean squared error, and reconstructed time-activity curves with lower bias and variation in most regions. Excluding the Inception or channel attention module resulted in degraded image qualities. The FBPnet-Sep model showed acceptable performance when applied to low-dose data. Additionally, it could deal with multiple tracer combinations. The qualities of predicted images, as well as the accuracy of derived time-activity curves and macro-parameters were slightly improved by incorporating a decay correction module.

Conclusions: The proposed FBPnet-Sep model was considered a potential method for the reconstruction and signal separation of simultaneous dual-tracer PET imaging.

ABSTRACT:
This paper relates the post-analysis of the first edition of the HEad and neCK TumOR (HECKTOR) challenge. This challenge was held as a satellite event of the 23rd International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention (MICCAI) 2020, and was the first of its kind focusing on lesion segmentation in combined FDG-PET and CT image modalities. The challenge's task is the automatic segmentation of the Gross Tumor Volume (GTV) of Head and Neck (H&N) oropharyngeal primary tumors in FDG-PET/CT images. To this end, the participants were given a training set of 201 cases from four different centers and their methods were tested on a held-out set of 53 cases from a fifth center. The methods were ranked according to the Dice Score Coefficient (DSC) averaged across all test cases. An additional inter-observer agreement study was organized to assess the difficulty of the task from a human perspective. 64 teams registered to the challenge, among which 10 provided a paper detailing their approach. The best method obtained an average DSC of 0.7591, showing a large improvement over our proposed baseline method and the inter-observer agreement, associated with DSCs of 0.6610 and 0.61, respectively. The automatic methods proved to successfully leverage the wealth of metabolic and structural properties of combined PET and CT modalities, significantly outperforming human inter-observer agreement level, semi-automatic thresholding based on PET images as well as other single modality-based methods. This promising performance is one step forward towards large-scale radiomics studies in H&N cancer, obviating the need for error-prone and time-consuming manual delineation of GTVs.

TITLE: Quantitative bone SPECT/CT reconstruction utilizing anatomical information

AUTHORS: Tuija S Kangasmaa, Chris Constable, Antti O Sohlberg

JOURNAL: EJNMMI physics

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Background: Bone SPECT/CT has been shown to offer superior sensitivity and specificity compared to conventional whole-body planar scanning. Furthermore, bone SPECT/CT allows quantitative imaging, which is challenging with planar methods. In order to gain better quantitative accuracy, Bayesian reconstruction algorithms, including both image derived and anatomically guided priors, have been utilized in reconstruction in PET/CT scanning, but they have not been widely used in SPECT/CT studies. Therefore, the aim of this work was to evaluate the performance of CT-guided reconstruction in quantitative bone SPECT.

Methods: Three Bayesian reconstruction methods were evaluated against the conventional ordered subsets expectation maximization (OSEM) reconstruction method. One of the studied Bayesian methods was the relative difference prior (RDP), which has recently gained popularity in PET reconstruction. The other two methods, anatomically guided smoothing prior (AMAP-S) and anatomically guided relative difference prior (AMAP-R), utilized anatomical information from the CT scan. The reconstruction methods were evaluated in terms of quantitative accuracy with artificial lesions inserted in clinical patient studies and with 20 real clinical patients. Maximum and mean standardized uptake values (SUVs) of the lesions were defined.

Results: The analyses showed that all studied Bayesian methods performed better than OSEM and the anatomical priors also outperformed RDP. The average relative error in mean SUV for the artificial lesion study for OSEM, RDP, AMAP-S, and AMAP-R was - 53%, - 35%, - 15%, and - 10%, when the CT study had matching lesions. In the patient study, the RDP method gave 16 ± 9% higher maximum SUV values than OSEM, while AMAP-S and AMAP-R offered increases of 36 ± 8% and 36 ± 9%, respectively. Mean SUV increased for RDP, AMAP-S, and AMAP-R by 18 ± 9%, 26 ± 5%, and 33 ± 5% when compared to OSEM.

Conclusions: The Bayesian methods with anatomical prior, especially the relative difference prior-based method (AMAP-R), outperformed OSEM and reconstruction without anatomical prior in terms of quantitative accuracy.

TITLE: Convolutional Encoder-Decoder Networks for Volumetric Computed Tomography Surviews from Single- and Dual-View Topograms

AUTHORS: Nadav Shapira, Siddharth Bharthulwar, Peter B Noël

JOURNAL: Research square

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Computed tomography (CT) is an extensively used imaging modality capable of generating detailed images of a patient's internal anatomy for diagnostic and interventional procedures. High-resolution volumes are created by measuring and combining information along many radiographic projection angles. In current medical practice, single and dual-view two-dimensional (2D) topograms are utilized for planning the proceeding diagnostic scans and for selecting favorable acquisition parameters, either manually or automatically, as well as for dose modulation calculations. In this study, we develop modified 2D to three-dimensional (3D) encoder-decoder neural network architectures to generate CT-like volumes from single and dual-view topograms. We validate the developed neural networks on synthesized topograms from publicly available thoracic CT datasets. Finally, we assess the viability of the proposed transformational encoder-decoder architecture on both common image similarity metrics and quantitative clinical use case metrics, a first for 2D-to-3D CT reconstruction research. According to our findings, both single-input and dual-input neural networks are able to provide accurate volumetric anatomical estimates. The proposed technology will allow for improved (i) planning of diagnostic CT acquisitions, (ii) input for various dose modulation techniques, and (iii) recommendations for acquisition parameters and/or automatic parameter selection. It may also provide for an accurate attenuation correction map for positron emission tomography (PET) with only a small fraction of the radiation dose utilized.

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Objective.Following previous works on virtual sources model with Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), we extend the proof of concept for generating back-to-back pairs of gammas with timing information, typically for Monte Carlo simulation of Positron Emission Tomography(PET) imaging.Approach.A conditional GAN is trained once from a low statistic simulation in a given attenuation phantom and enables the generation of various activity source distributions. GAN training input is a set of gammas exiting a phantom, tracked from a source of positron emitters, described by position, direction and energy. A new parameterization that improves the training is also proposed. An ideal PET reconstruction algorithm is used to evaluate the quality of the GAN.Main results.The proposed method is evaluated on National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) phantoms and with CT patient image showing good agreement with reference simulations. The proportions of 2-gammas, 1-gammas and absorbed-gammas are respected to within one percent, image profiles matched and recovery coefficients were close with less than 5% difference. GAN tends to blur gamma energy peak, e.g. 511 keV.Significance.Once trained, the GAN generator can be used as input source for Monte Carlo simulations of PET imaging systems, decreasing the computational time with speedups up to ×400 according to the configurations.

AUTHORS: Konstantinos G Zeimpekis, Lorenzo Mercolli, Maurizio Conti, Hasan Sari, George Prenosil, Kuangyu Shi, Axel Rominger

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: The image quality characteristics of two NEMA phantoms with yttrium-90 (90Y) were evaluated on a long axial field-of-view (AFOV) PET/CT. The purpose was to identify the optimized reconstruction setup for the imaging of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma after90Y radioembolization.

Methods: Two NEMA phantoms were used, where one had a 1:10 sphere to background activity concentration ratio and the second had cold background. Reconstruction parameters used are as follows: iterations 2 to 8, Gaussian filter 2- to 6-mm full-width-at-half-maximum, reconstruction matrices 440 × 440 and 220 × 220, high sensitivity (HS), and ultra-high sensitivity (UHS) modes. 50-, 40-, 30-, 20-, 10-, and 5-min acquisitions were reconstructed. The measurements included recovery coefficients (RC), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), background variability, and lung error which measures the residual error in the corrections. Patient data were reconstructed with 20-, 10-, 5-, and 1-min time frames and evaluated in terms of SNR.

Results: The RC for the hot phantom was 0.36, 0.45, 0.53, 0.63, 0.68, and 0.84 for the spheres with diameters of 10, 13, 17, 22, 28, and 37 mm, respectively, for UHS 2 iterations, a 220 × 220 matrix, and 50-min acquisition. The RC values did not differ with acquisition times down to 20 min. The SNR was the highest for 2 iterations, measured 11.7, 16.6, 17.6, 19.4, 21.9, and 27.7 while the background variability was the lowest (27.59, 27.08, 27.36, 26.44, 30.11, and 33.51%). The lung error was 18%. For the patient dataset, the SNR was 19%, 20%, 24%, and 31% higher for 2 iterations compared to 4 iterations for 20-, 10-, 5-, and 1-min time frames, respectively.

Conclusions: This study evaluates the NEMA image quality of a long AFOV PET/CT scanner with90Y. It provides high RC for the smallest sphere compared to other standard AFOV scanners at shorter scan times. The maximum patient SNR was for 2 iterations, 20 min, while 5 min delivers images with acceptable SNR.

TITLE: Enhancing Amyloid PET Quantification: MRI-Guided Super-Resolution Using Latent Diffusion Models

AUTHORS: Jay Shah, Yiming Che, Javad Sohankar, Ji Luo, Baoxin Li, Yi Su, Teresa Wu, For The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative

JOURNAL: Life (Basel, Switzerland)

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Amyloid PET imaging plays a crucial role in the diagnosis and research of Alzheimer's disease (AD), allowing non-invasive detection of amyloid-β plaques in the brain. However, the low spatial resolution of PET scans limits the accurate quantification of amyloid deposition due to partial volume effects (PVE). In this study, we propose a novel approach to addressing PVE using a latent diffusion model for resolution recovery (LDM-RR) of PET imaging. We leverage a synthetic data generation pipeline to create high-resolution PET digital phantoms for model training. The proposed LDM-RR model incorporates a weighted combination of L1, L2, and MS-SSIM losses at both noise and image scales to enhance MRI-guided reconstruction. We evaluated the model's performance in improving statistical power for detecting longitudinal changes and enhancing agreement between amyloid PET measurements from different tracers. The results demonstrate that the LDM-RR approach significantly improves PET quantification accuracy, reduces inter-tracer variability, and enhances the detection of subtle changes in amyloid deposition over time. We show that deep learning has the potential to improve PET quantification in AD, effectively contributing to the early detection and monitoring of disease progression.

JOURNAL: EJNMMI physics

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Background: In this study, we investigate the impact of increased PET acquisition time per bed position on lesion detectability, standard uptake value, and image noise in68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/MRI scans.

Methods: Scans of twenty patients were analyzed in this study. Patients were injected with68Ga-PSMA-11 (mean, 5.50 ± 1.49 mCi) and imaged on a 3.0 T time-of-flight PET/MRI. PET images were retrospectively reconstructed using 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 7, and 10 min of PET data. Lesion detectability was evaluated on a 5-point Likert Scale for each lesion in each reconstruction. Quantitative analysis was performed measuring image noise and lesion uptake.

Results: A total of 55 lesions were identified, and lesion detectability increased from 2.07 ± 1.14 for 0.5 min to 4.93 ± 0.26 for 10 min (p < 0.001), with no significant difference detected between 7 and 10 min of scan time. Average SUVmaxdecreased from 9.89 ± 6.62 for 0.5 min to 8.64 ± 6.81 for 10 min. Noise decreased from 0.72 ± 0.22 for 0.5 min to 0.31 ± 0.12 for 10 min (p < 0.001) and were nearly equivalent between 7 and 10 min. Pairwise interaction terms between size, SUVmax, and scan time were all found to be significant, although the interaction term between SUVmaxand scan time was found to be the most significant.

Conclusions: Increased acquisition duration improves image quality by increasing detectability and reducing noise. In patients with biochemical recurrence, increased acquisition time up to 7 min improves lesion detection.

ABSTRACT:
The goal of developing a PET dedicated to the brain (CareMiBrain) has evolved from its initial approach to diagnosis and monitoring of dementias, to the more ambitious of creating a revolutionary clinical pathway for the knowledge and personalized treatment of multiple neurological diseases. The main innovative feature of CareMiBrain is the use of detectors with continuous crystals, which allow a high resolution determination of the depth of annihilation photons interaction within the thickness of the scintillation crystal. The technical validation phase of the equipment consisted of a pilot, prospective and observational study whose objective was to obtain the first images (40 patients), analyze them and make adjustments in the acquisition, reconstruction and correction parameters, comparing the image quality of the CareMiBrain equipment with that of the whole-body PET/CT. Thanks to the team meetings and the joint analysis of the images, it was possible to detect its weak points and some of its causes. The calibration, acquisition and processing processes, as well as the reconstruction, were optimized, the number of iterations was set to achieve the best signal-to-noise ratio, the random correction was optimized and a post-processing algorithm was included in the reconstruction algorithm. The main technical improvements implemented in this phase of technical validation carried out through collaboration of the Services of Nuclear Medicine and Neurology of the Hospital Clínico San Carlos with the Spanish company Oncovision will be exposed in a project financed with funds from the European Union (Horizon 2020 innovation program, 713323).

TITLE: Modification of [18F]-FDG PET/CT imaging protocols in obese oncology patients: A nationwide survey

AUTHORS: R Oliveira, L Figueiredo, P Costa

JOURNAL: Radiography (London, England : 1995)

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Introduction: The use of medical imaging for diagnosis, staging and follow-up in Oncology context is incredibly important, being the use of [18F]-FDG PET/CT particularly advantageous in specific contexts like the case of obese patients. However, imaging the latter can be challenging sometimes, since their own body size may affect overall image quality and adds technical difficulties for the operator(s) performing the examination.

Methods: This research project was developed with the aim of analysing the current personal practices of Portuguese Nuclear Medicine Technologists (NMTs) in the adaptation of18F-FDG PET/CT oncological protocols for obese patients and comparing the results with parameters referenced in literature. A non-experimental research study was conducted using a survey delivered online to NMTs through social media platforms (Facebook® and LinkedIn®) and by sending the link directly to contacts within the research team professional and personal networks.

Results: Answers from a total of 26 participants were obtained, with 88.5% of participants admitting modifying technical protocols in examinations for obese patients. Changes in PET protocols included an increase in the administered activity (60.9%), an increase in scan time per individual bed position (69.6%) and the use of Time-of-Flight (TOF) technology whenever available. Protocol changes in CT included increasing the mA (82.6%), raising the KVp (47.8%), the application of iterative reconstruction (69.6%) and the use of automatic exposure control (AEC) (52.2%). The remaining parameters (pitch, algorithm, slice thickness, display FOV, gantry rotation time and energy acceptance window) were claimed not to be modified by around 90% of professionals.

Conclusion: Portuguese NMTs tend to change the [18F]-FDG PET/CT protocols for obese patients. However, while some of the parameters appear to be contradictory or redundant, others require further optimisation, especially in the CT component.

Implications for practice: Efforts should be made to optimize acquisition protocols used in [18F]-FDG PET/CT scans for obese patients.

TITLE: Spatio-Temporal Positron Emission Tomography Reconstruction with Attenuation and Motion Correction

AUTHORS: Enza Cece, Pierre Meyrat, Enza Torino, Olivier Verdier, Massimiliano Colarieti-Tosti

JOURNAL: Journal of imaging

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
The detection of cancer lesions of a comparable size to that of the typical system resolution of modern scanners is a long-standing problem in Positron Emission Tomography. In this paper, the effect of composing an image-registering convolutional neural network with the modeling of the static data acquisition (i.e., the forward model) is investigated. Two algorithms for Positron Emission Tomography reconstruction with motion and attenuation correction are proposed and their performance is evaluated in the detectability of small pulmonary lesions. The evaluation is performed on synthetic data with respect to chosen figures of merit, visual inspection, and an ideal observer. The commonly used figures of merit-Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio, Recovery Coefficient, and Signal Difference-to-Noise Ration-give inconclusive responses, whereas visual inspection and the Channelised Hotelling Observer suggest that the proposed algorithms outperform current clinical practice.

TITLE: PET imaging and quantification of small animals using a clinical SiPM-based camera

AUTHORS: Cédric Desmonts, Charline Lasnon, Cyril Jaudet, Nicolas Aide

JOURNAL: EJNMMI physics

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Background: Small-animal PET imaging is an important tool in preclinical oncology. This study evaluated the ability of a clinical SiPM-PET camera to image several rats simultaneously and to perform quantification data analysis.

Methods: Intrinsic spatial resolution was measured using 18F line sources, and image quality was assessed using a NEMA NU 4-2018 phantom. Quantification was evaluated using a fillable micro-hollow sphere phantom containing 4 spheres of different sizes (ranging from 3.95 to 7.86 mm). Recovery coefficients were computed for the maximum (Amax) and the mean (A50) pixel values measured on a 50% isocontour drawn on each sphere. Measurements were performed first with the phantom placed in the centre of the field of view and then in the off-centre position with the presence of three scattering sources to simulate the acquisition of four animals simultaneously. Quantification accuracy was finally validated using four 3D-printed phantoms mimicking rats with four subcutaneous tumours each. All experiments were performed for both 18F and 68Ga radionuclides.

Results: Radial spatial resolutions measured using the PSF reconstruction algorithm were 1.80 mm and 1.78 mm for centred and off-centred acquisitions, respectively. Spill-overs in air and water and uniformity computed with the NEMA phantom centred in the FOV were 0.05, 0.1 and 5.55% for 18F and 0.08, 0.12 and 2.81% for 68Ga, respectively. Recovery coefficients calculated with the 18F-filled micro-hollow sphere phantom for each sphere varied from 0.51 to 1.43 for Amax and from 0.40 to 1.01 for A50. These values decreased from 0.28 to 0.92 for Amax and from 0.22 to 0.66 for A50 for 68 Ga acquisition. The results were not significantly different when imaging phantoms in the off-centre position with 3 scattering sources. Measurements performed with the four 3D-printed phantoms showed a good correlation between theoretical and measured activity in simulated tumours, with r2values of 0.99 and 0.97 obtained for 18F and 68Ga, respectively.

Conclusion: We found that the clinical SiPM-based PET system was close to that obtained with a dedicated small-animal PET device. This study showed the ability of such a system to image four rats simultaneously and to perform quantification analysis for radionuclides commonly used in oncology.

TITLE: Clinical Pilot of a Deep Learning Elastic Registration Algorithm to Improve Misregistration Artifact and Image Quality on Routine Oncologic PET/CT

AUTHORS: Jordan H Chamberlin, Joshua Schaefferkoetter, James Hamill, Ismail M Kabakus, Kevin P Horn, Jim O'Doherty, Saeed Elojeimy

JOURNAL: Academic radiology

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Rationale and objectives: Misregistration artifacts between the PET and attenuation correction CT (CTAC) exams can degrade image quality and cause diagnostic errors. Deep learning (DL)-warped elastic registration methods have been proposed to improve misregistration errors.

Materials and methods: 30 patients undergoing routine oncologic examination (2018F-FDG PET/CT and 1064Cu-DOTATATE PET/CT) were retrospectively identified and compared using unmodified CTAC, and a DL-augmented spatial transformation CT attenuation map. Primary endpoints included differences in subjective image quality and standardized uptake values (SUV). Exams were randomized to reduce reader bias, and three radiologists rated image quality across six anatomic sites using a modified Likert scale. Measures of local bias and lesion SUV were also quantitatively evaluated.

Results: The DL attenuation correction methods were associated with higher image quality and reduced misregistration artifacts (Mean18F-FDG quality rating=3.5-3.8 for DL vs 3.2-3.5 for standard reconstruction (STD); Mean64Cu-DOTATATE quality rating= 3.2-3.4 for DL vs 2.1-3.3; P < 0.05 for STD, for all except64Cu-DOTATATE inferior spleen). Percent change in superior liver SUVmeanfor18F-FDG and64Cu-DOTATATE were 5.3 ± 4.9 and 8.2 ± 4.1%, respectively. Measures of signal-to-noise ratio were significantly improved for the DL over STD (Hepatopulmonary index (HPI) [18F-FDG] = 4.5 ± 1.2 vs 4.0 ± 1.1, P < 0.001; HPI [64Cu-DOTATATE] = 16.4 ± 16.9 vs 12.5 ± 5.5, P = 0.039).

Conclusion: Deep learning elastic registration for CT attenuation correction maps on routine oncology PET/CT decreases misregistration artifacts, with a greater impact on PET scans with longer acquisition times.

TITLE: Correcting CT misregistration in data-driven gated (DDG) PET with PET self-gating and deformable image registration

AUTHORS: Peng Sun, M Allan Thomas, Dershan Luo, Tinsu Pan

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Background: Misregistration between CT and PET data can result in mis-localization and inaccurate quantification of functional uptake in whole body PET/CT imaging. This problem is exacerbated when an abnormal inspiration occurs during the free-breathing helical CT (FB CT) used for attenuation correction of PET data. In data-driven gated (DDG) PET, the data selected for reconstruction is typically derived from the end-expiration (EE) phase of the breathing cycle, making this potential issue worse.

Purpose: The objective of this study is to develop a deformable image registration (DIR)-based respiratory motion model to improve the registration and quantification between misregistered FB CT and PET.

Methods: Twenty-two whole-body18F-FDG PET/CT scans encompassing 48 lesions in misregistered regions were analyzed in this study. End-inspiration (EI) and EE PET data were derived from -10% to 15% and 30% to 80% of the breathing cycle, respectively. DIR was used to estimate a motion model from the EE to EI phase of the PET data. The model was then used to generate PET images at any phase of up to four times the amplitude of motion between EE and EI for correlation with the misregistered FB CT. Once a matched phase of the FB CT was determined, FB CT was deformed to a pseudo CT at the EE phase (DIR CT). DIR CT was compared with the ground truth DDG CT for AC and localization of the DDG PET.

Results: Between DDG PET/FB CT and DDG PET/DIR CT, a significant increase in ∆%SUV was observed (p < 0.01), with median values elevating from 26.7% to 42.4%. This new method was most effective for lesions ≤3 cm proximal to the diaphragm (p < 0.001) but showed decreasing efficacy as the distance increased. When FB CT was severely misregistered with DDG PET (>3 cm), DDG PET/DIR CT outperformed DDG PET/FB CT alone (p < 0.05). Even when patients showed varied breathing patterns during the PET/CT scan, DDG PET/DIR CT still surpassed the efficiency of DDG PET/FB CT (p < 0.01). Though DDG PET/DIR CT couldn't match the performance of the DDG PET/CT ground truth (42.4% vs. 53.6%, p < 0.01), it reached 84% of its quantification, demonstrating good agreement and a strong overall correlation (regression coefficient of 0.94, p < 0.0001). In some cases, anatomical distortion and blurring, and misregistration error were observed in DIR CT, rendering it still unable to correct inaccurate localization near the boundaries of two organs.

Conclusions: Based on the motion model derived from gated PET data, DIR CT can significantly improve the quantification and localization of DDG PET. This approach can achieve a performance level of about 84% of the ground truth established by DDG PET/CT. These results show that self-gated PET and DIR CT may offer an alternative clinical solution to DDG PET and FB CT for quantification without the need for additional cine-CT imaging. DIR CT was at times inferior to DDG CT due to some distortion and blurring of anatomy and misregistration error.

TITLE: Low 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose dose positron emission tomography assisted by a deep-learning image-denoising technique in patients with lymphoma

AUTHORS: Lei Yan, Zhao Wang, Dacheng Li, Yangyang Wang, Guangjie Yang, Yujun Zhao, Yan Kong, Rui Wang, Runze Wu, Zhenguang Wang

JOURNAL: Quantitative imaging in medicine and surgery

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Background: Patients with lymphoma receive multiple positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) exams for monitoring of the therapeutic response. With PET imaging, a reduced level of injected fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]FDG) activity can be administered while maintaining the image quality. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of applying a deep learning (DL) denoising-technique on image quality and the quantification of metabolic parameters and Deauville score (DS) of a low [18F]FDG dose PET in patients with lymphoma.

Methods: This study retrospectively enrolled 62 patients who underwent [18F]FDG PET scans. The low-dose (LD) data were simulated by taking a 50% duration of routine-dose (RD) PET list-mode data in the reconstruction, and a U-Net-based denoising neural network was applied to improve the images of LD PET. The visual image quality score (1 = undiagnostic, 5 = excellent) and DS were assessed in all patients by nuclear radiologists. The maximum, mean, and standard deviation (SD) of the standardized uptake value (SUV) in the liver and mediastinum were measured. In addition, lesions in some patients were segmented using a fixed threshold of 2.5, and their SUV, metabolic tumor volume (MTV), and tumor lesion glycolysis (TLG) were measured. The correlation coefficient and limits of agreement between the RD and LD group were analyzed.

Results: The visual image quality of the LD group was improved compared with the RD group. The DS was similar between the RD and LD group, and the negative (DS 1-3) and positive (DS 4-5) results remained unchanged. The correlation coefficients of SUV in the liver, mediastinum, and lesions were all >0.85. The mean differences of SUVmaxand SUVmeanbetween the RD and LD groups, respectively, were 0.22 [95% confidence interval (CI): -0.19 to 0.64] and 0.02 (95% CI: -0.17 to 0.20) in the liver, 0.13 (95% CI: -0.17 to 0.42) and 0.02 (95% CI: -0.12 to 0.16) in the mediastinum, and -0.75 (95% CI: -3.42 to 1.91), and -0.13 (95% CI: -0.57 to 0.31) in lesions. The mean differences in MTV and TLG were 0.85 (95% CI: -2.27 to 3.98) and 4.06 (95% CI: -20.53 to 28.64) between the RD and LD groups.

Conclusions: The DL denoising technique enables accurate tumor assessment and quantification with LD [18F]FDG PET imaging in patients with lymphoma.

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: To generate diagnostic18F-FDG PET images of pediatric cancer patients from ultra-low-dose18F-FDG PET input images, using a novel artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm.

Methods: We used whole-body18F-FDG-PET/MRI scans of 33 children and young adults with lymphoma (3-30 years) to develop a convolutional neural network (CNN), which combines inputs from simulated 6.25% ultra-low-dose18F-FDG PET scans and simultaneously acquired MRI scans to produce a standard-dose18F-FDG PET scan. The image quality of ultra-low-dose PET scans, AI-augmented PET scans, and clinical standard PET scans was evaluated by traditional metrics in computer vision and by expert radiologists and nuclear medicine physicians, using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests and weighted kappa statistics.

Results: The peak signal-to-noise ratio and structural similarity index were significantly higher, and the normalized root-mean-square error was significantly lower on the AI-reconstructed PET images compared to simulated 6.25% dose images (p < 0.001). Compared to the ground-truth standard-dose PET, SUVmaxvalues of tumors and reference tissues were significantly higher on the simulated 6.25% ultra-low-dose PET scans as a result of image noise. After the CNN augmentation, the SUVmaxvalues were recovered to values similar to the standard-dose PET. Quantitative measures of the readers' diagnostic confidence demonstrated significantly higher agreement between standard clinical scans and AI-reconstructed PET scans (kappa = 0.942) than 6.25% dose scans (kappa = 0.650).

Conclusions: Our CNN model could generate simulated clinical standard18F-FDG PET images from ultra-low-dose inputs, while maintaining clinically relevant information in terms of diagnostic accuracy and quantitative SUV measurements.

TITLE: A quantitative clinical evaluation of simultaneous reconstruction of attenuation and activity in time-of-flight PET

AUTHORS: Haiqiong Zhang, Jingnan Wang, Nan Li, Yue Zhang, Jie Cui, Li Huo, Hui Zhang

JOURNAL: BMC medical imaging

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Background: The maximum likelihood activity and attenuation (MLAA) reconstruction algorithm has been proposed to jointly estimate tracer activity and attenuation at the same time, and proven to be a promising solution to the CT attenuation correction (CT-AC) artifacts in PET images. This study aimed to perform a quantitative evaluation and clinical validation of the MLAA method.

Methods: A uniform cylinder phantom filled with18F-FDG solution was scanned to optimize the reconstruction parameters for the implemented MLAA algorithm. 67 patients who underwent whole-body18F-FDG PET/CT scan were retrospectively recruited. PET images were reconstructed using MLAA and clinical standard OSEM algorithm with CT-AC (CT-OSEM). The mean and maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmean and SUVmax) in regions of interest (ROIs) of organs, high uptake lesions and areas affected by metal implants and respiration motion artifacts were quantitatively analyzed.

Results: In quantitative analysis, SUVs in patient's organ ROIs between two methods showed R2ranging from 0.91 to 0.98 and k ranging from 0.90 to 1.06, and the average SUVmax and SUVmean differences between two methods were within 10% range, except for the lung ROI, which was 10.5% and 16.73% respectively. The average SUVmax and SUVmean differences of a total of 117 high uptake lesions were 7.25% and 7.10% respectively. 20 patients were identified to have apparent respiration motion artifacts in the liver in CT-OSEM images, and the SUVs differences between two methods measured at dome of the liver were significantly larger than measured at middle part of the liver. 10 regions with obvious metal artifacts were identified in CT-OSEM images and the average SUVmean and SUVmax differences in metal implants affected regions were reported to be 52.90% and 56.20% respectively.

Conclusions: PET images reconstructed using MLAA are clinically acceptable in terms of image quality as well as quantification and it is a useful tool in clinical practice, especially when CT-AC may cause respiration motion and metal artifacts. Moreover, this study also provides technical reference and data support for the future iteration and development of PET reconstruction technology of SUV accurate quantification.

TITLE: Impacts of acquisition and reconstruction parameters on the absolute technetium quantification of the cadmium-zinc-telluride-based SPECT/CT system: a phantom study

AUTHORS: Ruyi Zhang, Miao Wang, Yaqian Zhou, Shen Wang, Yiming Shen, Ning Li, Peng Wang, Jian Tan, Zhaowei Meng, Qiang Jia

JOURNAL: EJNMMI physics

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Background: The digital cadmium-zinc-telluride (CZT)-based SPECT system has many advantages, including better spatial and energy resolution. However, the impacts of different acquisition and reconstruction parameters on CZT SPECT quantification might still need to be validated. This study aimed to evaluate the impacts of acquisition parameters (the main energy window and acquisition time per frame) and reconstruction parameters (the number of iterations, subsets in iterative reconstruction, post-filter, and image correction methods) on the technetium quantification of CZT SPECT/CT.

Methods: A phantom (PET NEMA/IEC image quality, USA) was filled with four target-to-background (T/B) ratios (32:1, 16:1, 8:1, and 4:1) of technetium. Mean uptake values (the calculated mean concentrations for spheres) were measured to evaluate the recovery coefficient (RC) changes under different acquisition and reconstruction parameters. The corresponding standard deviations of mean uptake values were also measured to evaluate the quantification error. Image quality was evaluated using the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) NU 2-2012 standard.

Results: For all T/B ratios, significant correlations were found between iterations and RCs (r = 0.62-0.96 for 1-35 iterations, r = 0.94-0.99 for 35-90 iterations) as well as between the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the Gaussian filter and RCs (r = - 0.86 to - 1.00, all P values < 0.05). The regression coefficients of 1-35 iterations were higher than those of 35-90 iterations (0.51-1.60 vs. 0.02-0.19). RCs calculated with AC (attenuation correction) + SC (scatter correction) + RR (resolution recovery correction) combination were more accurate (53.82-106.70%) than those calculated with other combinations (all P values < 0.05). No significant statistical differences (all P values > 0.05) were found between the 15% and 20% energy windows except for the 32:1 T/B ratio (P value = 0.023) or between the 10 s/frame and 120 s/frame acquisition times except for the 4:1 T/B ratio (P value = 0.015) in terms of RCs.

Conclusions: CZT-SPECT/CT of technetium resulted in good quantification accuracy. The favourable acquisition parameters might be a 15% energy window and 40 s/frame of acquisition time. The favourable reconstruction parameters might be 35 iterations, 20 subsets, the AC + SC + RR correction combination, and no filter.

TITLE: Enhanced direct joint attenuation and scatter correction of whole-body PET images via context-aware deep networks

AUTHORS: Saeed Izadi, Isaac Shiri, Carlos F Uribe, Parham Geramifar, Habib Zaidi, Arman Rahmim, Ghassan Hamarneh

JOURNAL: Zeitschrift fur medizinische Physik

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
In positron emission tomography (PET), attenuation and scatter corrections are necessary steps toward accurate quantitative reconstruction of the radiopharmaceutical distribution. Inspired by recent advances in deep learning, many algorithms based on convolutional neural networks have been proposed for automatic attenuation and scatter correction, enabling applications to CT-less or MR-less PET scanners to improve performance in the presence of CT-related artifacts. A known characteristic of PET imaging is to have varying tracer uptakes for various patients and/or anatomical regions. However, existing deep learning-based algorithms utilize a fixed model across different subjects and/or anatomical regions during inference, which could result in spurious outputs. In this work, we present a novel deep learning-based framework for the direct reconstruction of attenuation and scatter-corrected PET from non-attenuation-corrected images in the absence of structural information in the inference. To deal with inter-subject and intra-subject uptake variations in PET imaging, we propose a novel model to perform subject- and region-specific filtering through modulating the convolution kernels in accordance to the contextual coherency within the neighboring slices. This way, the context-aware convolution can guide the composition of intermediate features in favor of regressing input-conditioned and/or region-specific tracer uptakes. We also utilized a large cohort of 910 whole-body studies for training and evaluation purposes, which is more than one order of magnitude larger than previous works. In our experimental studies, qualitative assessments showed that our proposed CT-free method is capable of producing corrected PET images that accurately resemble ground truth images corrected with the aid of CT scans. For quantitative assessments, we evaluated our proposed method over 112 held-out subjects and achieved an absolute relative error of 14.30±3.88% and a relative error of -2.11%±2.73% in whole-body.

TITLE: Evaluating two respiratory correction methods for abdominal PET/MRI imaging

AUTHORS: Weiwei Ruan, Fang Liu, Xun Sun, Fan Hu, Tingfan Wu, Yongxue Zhang, Xiaoli Lan

JOURNAL: EJNMMI physics

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Background: To evaluate two respiratory correction methods for abdominal PET/MRI images and further to analyse the effects on standard uptake values (SUVs) of respiratory motion correction, 17 patients with 25 abdominal lesions on18F-FDG PET/CT were scanned with PET/MRI. PET images were reconstructed using end-expiratory respiratory gating and multi-bin respiratory gating. Meanwhile, full data and the first 3 min and 20 s of data acquired both without respiratory gating were reconstructed for evaluation. Five parameters, including the SUVmaxand SUVmeanin the lesions, the SUVmeanand standard deviation (SD) in the background, and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), were calculated and used for statistical comparisons. The differences in multi-bin respiratory gating and reconstruction of full data, relative to the reconstruction of the first 3 min and 20 s of data acquired, were calculated.

Results: Compared with PET/CT, the longer scanning time of abdominal PET/MRI makes respiratory motion correction necessary. The multi-bin respiratory gating correction could reduce the PET image blur and increase the SUVmax(11.98%) and SUVmean(13.12%) of the lesions significantly (p = 0.00), which was much more effective than end-expiratory respiratory gating for abdominal PET/MRI. The added value of SUVmaxcaused by respiratory motion correction has no significant difference compared with that caused by count loss with the correction (p = 0.39), which was rarely reported by previous studies.

Conclusion: Based on the current parameters, the method of multi-bin respiratory gating was more effective for respiratory motion correction in abdominal PET/MRI in comparisons with the method of end-respiratory gating. However, the increased noise in gated images, due to the fact that PET data get discarded, is partly responsible for the increase in SUVmax.

ABSTRACT:
Background: To explore the feasibility of short-time-window Ki imaging using a population-based arterial input function (IF) and optimized Bayesian penalized likelihood (BPL) reconstruction as a practical alternative to long-time-window Ki imaging with an individual patient-based IF. Myocardial Ki images were generated from 73 dynamic18F-FDG-PET/CT scans of 30 patients with cardiac sarcoidosis. For each dynamic scan, the Ki images were obtained using the IF from each individual patient and a long time window (10-60 min). In addition, Ki images were obtained using the normalized averaged population-based IF and BPL algorithms with different beta values (350, 700, and 1000) with a short time window (40-60 min). The visual quality of each image was visually rated using a 4-point scale (0, not visible; 1, poor; 2, moderate; and 3, good), and the Ki parameters (Ki-max, Ki-mean, Ki-volume) of positive myocardial lesions were measured independently by two readers. Wilcoxon's rank sum test, McNemar's test, or linear regression analysis were performed to assess the differences or relationships between two quantitative variables.

Results: Both readers similarly rated 51 scans as positive (scores = 1-3) and 22 scans as negative (score = 0) for all four Ki images. Among the three types of population-based IF Ki images, the proportion of images with scores of 3 was highest with a beta of 1000 (78.4 and 72.5%, respectively) and lowest with a beta of 350 (33.3 and 23.5%) for both readers (all p < 0.001). The coefficients of determination between the Ki parameters obtained with the individual patient-based IF and those obtained with the population-based IF were highest with a beta of 1000 for both readers (Ki-max, 0.91 and 0.92, respectively; Ki-mean, 0.91 and 0.92, respectively; Ki-volume, 0.75 and 0.60, respectively; and all p < 0.001).

Conclusions: Short-time-window Ki images with a population-based IF reconstructed using the BPL algorithm and a high beta value were closely correlated with long-time-window Ki images generated with an individual patient-based IF. Short-time-window Ki images using a population-based IF and BPL reconstruction might represent practical alternatives to long-time-window Ki images generated using an individual patient-based IF.

Methods: This study presents an automatic segmentation of pulmonary lobes using a fully convolutional neural network named dense V-network (DenseVNet) on lung cancer screening LDCT images. A total of 160 LDCT cases for lung cancer screening (100 in the training set, 10 in the validation set, and 50 in the test set) was included in this study. Specifically, the template of pulmonary lobes (the right lung consists of three lobes, and the left lung consists of two lobes) were obtained from pixel-level annotations by semiautomatic segmentation platform. Then, the model was trained under the supervision of the LDCT training set. Finally, the trained model was used to segment the LDCT in the test set. Dice coefficient, Jaccard coefficient, and Hausdorff distance were adopted as evaluation metrics to verify the performance of our segmentation model.

Results: In this study, the model achieved the accurate segmentation of each pulmonary lobe in seconds without the intervention of researchers. The testing set consisted 50 LDCT cases were used to evaluate the performance of the segmentation model. The all-lobes Dice coefficient of the test set was 0.944, the Jaccard coefficient was 0.896, and the Hausdorff distance was 92.908 mm.

Conclusions: The segmentation model based on LDCT can automatically and robustly and efficiently segment pulmonary lobes. It will provide effective location information and contour constraints for pulmonary nodule detection on LDCT images for lung cancer screening, which may have potential clinical application.

TITLE: Low-count whole-body PET with deep learning in a multicenter and externally validated study

ABSTRACT:
More widespread use of positron emission tomography (PET) imaging is limited by its high cost and radiation dose. Reductions in PET scan time or radiotracer dosage typically degrade diagnostic image quality (DIQ). Deep-learning-based reconstruction may improve DIQ, but such methods have not been clinically evaluated in a realistic multicenter, multivendor environment. In this study, we evaluated the performance and generalizability of a deep-learning-based image-quality enhancement algorithm applied to fourfold reduced-count whole-body PET in a realistic clinical oncologic imaging environment with multiple blinded readers, institutions, and scanner types. We demonstrate that the low-count-enhanced scans were noninferior to the standard scans in DIQ (p < 0.05) and overall diagnostic confidence (p < 0.001) independent of the underlying PET scanner used. Lesion detection for the low-count-enhanced scans had a high patient-level sensitivity of 0.94 (0.83-0.99) and specificity of 0.98 (0.95-0.99). Interscan kappa agreement of 0.85 was comparable to intrareader (0.88) and pairwise inter-reader agreements (maximum of 0.72). SUV quantification was comparable in the reference regions and lesions (lowest p-value=0.59) and had high correlation (lowest CCC = 0.94). Thus, we demonstrated that deep learning can be used to restore diagnostic image quality and maintain SUV accuracy for fourfold reduced-count PET scans, with interscan variations in lesion depiction, lower than intra- and interreader variations. This method generalized to an external validation set of clinical patients from multiple institutions and scanner types. Overall, this method may enable either dose or exam-duration reduction, increasing safety and lowering the cost of PET imaging.

TITLE: Variability in PET image quality and quantification measured with a permanently filled 68Ge-phantom: a multi-center study

ABSTRACT:
Background: This study evaluated, as a snapshot, the variability in quantification and image quality (IQ) of the clinically utilized PET [18F]FDG whole-body protocols in Finland using a NEMA/IEC IQ phantom permanently filled with68Ge.

Methods: The phantom was imaged on 14 PET-CT scanners, including a variety of models from two major vendors. The variability of the recovery coefficients (RCmax, RCmeanand RCpeak) of the hot spheres as well as percent background variability (PBV), coefficient of variation of the background (COVBG) and accuracy of corrections (AOC) were studied using images from clinical and standardized protocols with 20 repeated measurements. The ranges of the RCs were also compared to the limits of the EARL18F standards 2 accreditation (EARL2). The impact of image noise on these parameters was studied using averaged images (AVIs).

Results: The largest variability in RC values of the routine protocols was found for the RCmaxwith a range of 68% and with 10% intra-scanner variability, decreasing to 36% when excluding protocols with suspected cross-calibration failure or without point-spread-function (PSF) correction. The RC ranges of individual hot spheres in routine or standardized protocols or AVIs fulfilled the EARL2 ranges with two minor exceptions, but fulfilling the exact EARL2 limits for all hot spheres was variable. RCpeakwas less dependent on averaging and reconstruction parameters than RCmaxand RCmean. The PBV, COVBGand AOC varied between 2.3-11.8%, 9.6-17.8% and 4.8-32.0%, respectively, for the routine protocols. The RC ranges, PBV and COVBGwere decreased when using AVIs. With AOC, when excluding routine protocols without PSF correction, the maximum value dropped to 15.5%.

Conclusion: The maximum variability of the RC values for the [18F]FDG whole-body protocols was about 60%. The RC ranges of properly cross-calibrated scanners with PSF correction fitted to the EARL2 RC ranges for individual sphere sizes, but fulfilling the exact RC limits would have needed further optimization. RCpeakwas the most robust RC measure. Besides COVBG, also RCs and PVB were sensitive to image noise.

TITLE: Application of NEMA protocols to verify GATE models based on the Digital Biograph Vision and the Biograph Vision Quadra scanners

AUTHORS: Miriam Magela Peña-Acosta, Sergio Gallardo, María Lorduy-Alós, Gumersindo Verdú

JOURNAL: Zeitschrift fur medizinische Physik

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: The Monte Carlo method is an effective tool to simulate and verify PET systems. Furthermore, it can help in the design and optimization of new medical imaging devices and algorithms. In this framework, the goal of this work is to verify the GATE toolkit performance when applied to simulate two Siemens Healthineers PET scanners: a standard axial field-of-view Biograph Vision scanner and the new long axial field-of-view Biograph Vision Quadra scanner.

Methods: The simulation toolkit GATE is based on GEANT4, comprising its main functionalities and a set of domain-specific features in the field of medical physics. To accomplish our purpose, the guidelines described in the NEMA NU 2-2018 protocol are reproduced. Then the simulated results are compared to experimental data available in the literature for both PET scanners. The assessment of the models includes different studies of sensitivity, count rate performances, spatial resolution and image quality. These tests are intended to evaluate the image quality of PET devices.

Results: In the spatial resolution test, relative errors lower than 8% are obtained between the experiments and GATE models. The sensitivity is 17.2 cps/kBq (Vision) and 175.9 cps/kBq (Quadra), representing relative differences with the experiment of 6% and 0.3%, respectively. Deviations from peak NECR are less than 9%. In the Image Quality test, the contrast recovery coefficient for hot spheres, with 8 iterations and 5 subsets, ranges between 57-83% for Vision and 54-86% for Quadra. These values represent a maximum deviation between the simulations and the experiments of 10% for the Quadra scanner. In the case of the Vision scanner, the highest difference is observed for the 10 mm sphere (∼38%) due to the higher contrast recovery of the experiment caused by the Gibbs artifact from the use of PSF reconstruction.

Conclusions: The results of the simulations have provided evidence of a good agreement between the experimental data and the results obtained with GATE. Thus, this work supports the capability of this MC toolkit to accurately simulate the models of the Vision and Quadra scanners. This study has laid the basis for further research in this field and has identified several areas that could be explored.

TITLE: Deep progressive learning achieves whole-body low-dose 18F-FDG PET imaging

AUTHORS: Taisong Wang, Wenli Qiao, Ying Wang, Jingyi Wang, Yang Lv, Yun Dong, Zheng Qian, Yan Xing, Jinhua Zhao

JOURNAL: EJNMMI physics

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Objectives: To validate a total-body PET-guided deep progressive learning reconstruction method (DPR) for low-dose18F-FDG PET imaging.

Methods: List-mode data from the retrospective study (n = 26) were rebinned into short-duration scans and reconstructed with DPR. The standard uptake value (SUV) and tumor-to-liver ratio (TLR) in lesions and coefficient of variation (COV) in the liver in the DPR images were compared to the reference (OSEM images with full-duration data). In the prospective study, another 41 patients were injected with 1/3 of the activity based on the retrospective results. The DPR images (DPR_1/3(p)) were generated and compared with the reference (OSEM images with extended acquisition time). The SUV and COV were evaluated in three selected organs: liver, blood pool and muscle. Quantitative analyses were performed with lesion SUV and TLR, furthermore on small lesions (≤ 10 mm in diameter). Additionally, a 5-point Likert scale visual analysis was performed on the following perspectives: contrast, noise and diagnostic confidence.

Results: In the retrospective study, the DPR with one-third duration can maintain the image quality as the reference. In the prospective study, good agreement among the SUVs was observed in all selected organs. The quantitative results showed that there was no significant difference in COV between the DPR_1/3(p) group and the reference, while the visual analysis showed no significant differences in image contrast, noise and diagnostic confidence. The lesion SUVs and TLRs in the DPR_1/3(p) group were significantly enhanced compared with the reference, even for small lesions.

Conclusions: The proposed DPR method can reduce the administered activity of18F-FDG by up to 2/3 in a real-world deployment while maintaining image quality.

ABSTRACT:
Organs-on-Chips (OOCs), microdevices mimicking in vivo organs, find growing applications in disease modeling and drug discovery. With the increasing number of uses comes a strong demand for imaging capabilities of OOCs. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) would be ideal for OOC imaging, however, current PET systems have insufficient spatial resolution for this task. In this work, we propose the concept of an On-Chip PET system capable of imaging OOCs. Our system consists of four detectors arranged around the OOC device. Each detector is made of two monolithic Lutetium-yttrium oxyorthosilicate (LYSO) crystals and covered with Silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) on multiple surfaces. We use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained with data from a Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) to predict the first gamma-ray interaction position inside the detector from the light patterns that are recorded by the SiPMs on the detector's surfaces. With the Line of Responses (LORs) created by the predicted interaction positions, we reconstruct with Simultaneous Algebraic Reconstruction Technique (SART). The CNN achieves a mean average prediction error of 0.78 mm in the best configuration. We use the trained network to reconstruct an image of a grid of 21 point sources spread across the field-of-view and obtain a mean spatial resolution of 0.53 mm. We demonstrate that it is possible to achieve a spatial resolution of almost 0.5 mm in a PET system made of multiple monolithic LYSO crystals by directly predicting the scintillation position from light patterns created with SiPMs. We observe that CNNs from the ResNet family perform better than those from the EfficientNet family and that certain surfaces encode significantly more information for the scintillation-point prediction than others.

TITLE: Multiparametric dynamic whole-body PSMA PET/CT using [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 and [18F]PSMA-1007

AUTHORS: André H Dias, Mads R Jochumsen, Helle D Zacho, Ole L Munk, Lars C Gormsen

JOURNAL: EJNMMI research

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Background: Routine prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positron emission tomography (PET) performed for primary staging or restaging of prostate cancer patients is usually done as a single static image acquisition 60 min after tracer administration. In this study, we employ dynamic whole-body (D-WB) PET imaging to compare the pharmacokinetics of [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 and [18F]PSMA-1007 in various tissues and lesions, and to assess whether Patlak parametric images are quantitative and improve lesion detection and image readability.

Methods: Twenty male patients with prostate cancer were examined using a D-WB PSMA PET protocol. Ten patients were scanned with [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 and ten with [18F]PSMA-1007. Kinetic analyses were made using time-activity curves (TACs) extracted from organs (liver, spleen, bone, and muscle) and lesions. For each patient, three images were produced: SUV + Patlak parametric images (Kiand DV). All images were reviewed visually to compare lesion detection, image readability was quantified using target-to-background ratios (TBR), and Ki and DV values were compared.

Results: The two PSMA tracers exhibited markedly different pharmacokinetics in organs: reversible for [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 and irreversible for [18F]PSMA-1007. For both tracers, lesions kinetics were best described by an irreversible model. All parametric images were of good visual quality using both radiotracers. In general, Ki images were characterized by reduced vascular signal and increased lesion TBR compared with SUV images. No additional malignant lesions were identified on the parametric images.

Conclusion: D-WB PET/CT is feasible for both PSMA tracers allowing for direct reconstruction of parametric Ki images. The use of multiparametric PSMA images increased TBR but did not lead to the detection of more lesions. For quantitative whole-body Ki imaging, [18F]PSMA-1007 should be preferred over [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 due to its irreversible kinetics in organs and lesions.

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Aims: 18F-sodium fluoride (18F-NaF) positron emission tomography (PET) detects active microcalcification and predicts adverse outcomes including bioprosthetic valve deterioration. However, measuring small areas of18F-NaF uptake within moving structures remains challenging, requiring further optimization. We developed a representative cardiac phantom to optimize18F-NaF imaging of bioprosthetic valves.

Methods and results: We placed a bioprosthetic valve with two pockets sutured to the leaflets mimicking valvular lesions and a subvalvular ring mimicking the valve remnant into the phantom and injected each with18F-radionuclide (1 μCi pockets, 4 μCi ring). We injected the cardiac chambers with iohexol and18F-radionuclide (0.176 mCi) for background activity. PET and computed tomography (CT) images were acquired using a Siemens Biograph Vision high-resolution digital PET/CT scanner. We analysed target-to-background ratio (TBR) and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and subjective measures of image quality. We compared results with a human case of transcatheter aortic valve replacement. Initially the SNR and TBR in the phantom greatly exceeded those from human imaging. We reduced the scan duration used for reconstruction to 30 and 15 s, achieving comparable results (30 s vs. 15 s vs. patient: SNR 45.6 vs. 13.9 vs. 44.3, TBRmax6.5 vs. 5.4 vs. 4.1, noise 10.2% vs. 8.8% vs. 12.0%). With motion correction, SNR and image quality improved in the phantom (30 s 135.8 vs. 45.6, 15 s 32.9 vs. 13.9) but remained similar in the human case (47.3 vs. 44.3).

Conclusion: A cardiac phantom can mimic clinical18F-NaF valve bioprosthesis imaging, providing an opportunity to explore acquisition, reconstruction, and post-processing of18F-NaF PET/CT for small mobile cardiac structures.

TITLE: High-Quality Fusion and Visualization for MR-PET Brain Tumor Images via Multi-Dimensional Features

AUTHORS: Jinyu Wen, Asad Khan, Amei Chen, Weilong Peng, Meie Fang, C L Philip Chen, Ping Li

JOURNAL: IEEE transactions on image processing : a publication of the IEEE Signal Processing Society

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
The fusion of magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography can combine biological anatomical information and physiological metabolic information, which is of great significance for the clinical diagnosis and localization of lesions. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive linear fusion method for multi-dimensional features of brain magnetic resonance and positron emission tomography images based on a convolutional neural network, termed as MdAFuse. First, in the feature extraction stage, three-dimensional feature extraction modules are constructed to extract coarse, fine, and multi-scale information features from the source image. Second, at the fusion stage, the affine mapping function of multi-dimensional features is established to maintain a constant geometric relationship between the features, which can effectively utilize structural information from a feature map to achieve a better reconstruction effect. Furthermore, our MdAFuse comprises a key feature visualization enhancement algorithm designed to observe the dynamic growth of brain lesions, which can facilitate the early diagnosis and treatment of brain tumors. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method is superior to existing fusion methods in terms of visual perception and nine kinds of objective image fusion metrics. Specifically, in the results of MR-PET fusion, the SSIM (Structural Similarity) and VIF (Visual Information Fidelity) metrics show improvements of 5.61% and 13.76%, respectively, compared to the current state-of-the-art algorithm. Our project is publicly available at: https://github.com/22385wjy/MdAFuse.

TITLE: Total-body PET/CT - First Clinical Experiences and Future Perspectives

AUTHORS: Quinn Kwan-Tai Ng, Elizabeth Katherine Anna Triumbari, Negar Omidvari, Simon R Cherry, Ramsey D Badawi, Lorenzo Nardo

JOURNAL: Seminars in nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Total-body PET has come a long way from its first conception to today, with both total-body and long axial field of view (> 1m) scanners now being commercially available world-wide. The conspicuous signal collection efficiency gain, coupled with high spatial resolution, allows for higher sensitivity and improved lesion detection, enhancing several clinical applications not readily available on current conventional PET/CT scanners. This technology can provide (a) reduction in acquisition times with preservation of diagnostic quality images, benefitting specific clinical situations (i.e. pediatric patients) and the use of several existing radiotracers that present transient uptake over time and where small differences in acquisition time can greatly impact interpretation of images; (b) reduction in administered activity with minimal impact on image noise, thus reducing effective dose to the patient, improving staff safety, and helping with logistical concerns for short-lived radionuclides or long-lived radionuclides with poor dosimetry profiles that have had limited use on conventional PET scanners until now; (c) delayed scanning, that has shown to increase the detection of even small and previously occult malignant lesions by improved clearance in regions of significant background activity and by reduced visibility of coexisting inflammatory processes; (d) improvement in image quality, as a consequence of higher spatial resolution and sensitivity of total-body scanners, implying better appreciation of small structures and clinical implications with downstream prognostic consequences for patients; (e) simultaneous total-body dynamic imaging, that allows the measurement of full spatiotemporal distribution of radiotracers, kinetic modeling, and creation of multiparametric images, providing physiologic and biologically relevant data of the entire body at the same time. On the other hand, the higher physical and clinical sensitivity of total-body scanners bring along some limitations and challenges. The strong impact on clinical sensitivity potentially increases the number of false positive findings if the radiologist does not recalibrate interpretation considering the new technique. Delayed scanning causes logistical issues and introduces new interpretation questions for radiologists. Data storage capacity, longer processing and reconstruction time issues are other limitations, but they may be overcome in the near future by advancements in reconstruction algorithms and computing hardware.

TITLE: Simulation study of a brain PET scanner using TOF-DOI detectors equipped with first interaction position detection

AUTHORS: Yingying Li, Mitsuo Watanabe, Takashi Isobe, Kibo Ote, Aoi Tokui, Tomohide Omura, Huafeng Liu

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Objective. The aim of this study is to evaluate the performance characteristics of a brain positron emission tomography (PET) scanner composed of four-layer independent read-out time-of-flight depth-of-interaction (TOF-DOI) detectors capable of first interaction position (FIP) detection, using Geant4 application for tomographic emission(GATE). This includes the spatial resolution, sensitivity, count rate capability, and reconstructed image quality.Approach. The proposed TOF-DOI PET detector comprises four layers of a 50 × 50 cerium-doped lutetium-yttrium oxyorthosilicate (LYSO:Ce) scintillator array with 1 mm pitch size, coupled to a 16 × 16 multi-pixel photon counter array with 3.0 mm × 3.0 mm photosensitive segments. Along the direction distant from the center field-of-view (FOV), the scintillator thickness of the four layers is 2.5, 3, 4, and 6 mm. The four layers were simulated with a 150 ps coincidence time resolution and the independent readout make the FIP detection capable. The spatial resolution and imaging performance were compared among the true-FIP, winner-takes-all (WTA) and front-layer FIP (FL-FIP) methods (FL-FIP selects the interaction position located on the front-most interaction layer in all the interaction layers). The National Electrical Manufacturers Association NU 2-2018 procedure was referred and modified to evaluate the performance of proposed scanner.Main results. In detector evaluation, the intrinsic spatial resolutions were 0.52 and 0.76 mm full width at half-maximum (FWHM) at 0° and 30° incidentγ-rays in the first layer pair, respectively. The reconstructed spatial resolution by the filter backprojection (FBP) achieved sub-millimeter FWHM on average over the whole FOV. The maximum true count rate was 207.6 kcps at 15 kBq ml-1and the noise equivalent count rate (NECR_2R) was 54.7 kcps at 6.0 kBq ml-1. Total sensitivity was 45.2 cps kBq-1and 48.4 cps kBq-1at the center and 10 cm off-center FOV, respectively. The TOF and DOI reconstructions significantly improved the image quality in the phantom studies. Moreover, the FL-FIP outperformed the conventional WTA method in terms of the spatial resolution and image quality.Significance. The proposed brain PET scanner could achieve sub-millimeter spatial resolution and high image quality with TOF and DOI reconstruction, which is meaningful to the clinical oncology research. Meanwhile, the comparison among the three positioning methods indicated that the FL-FIP decreased the image degradation caused by Compton scatter more than WTA.

TITLE: Cross-validation study between the HRRT and the PET component of the SIGNA PET/MRI system with focus on neuroimaging

AUTHORS: Julia G Mannheim, Ju-Chieh Kevin Cheng, Nasim Vafai, Elham Shahinfard, Carolyn English, Jessamyn McKenzie, Jing Zhang, Laura Barlow, Vesna Sossi

JOURNAL: EJNMMI physics

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Background: The Siemens high-resolution research tomograph (HRRT - a dedicated brain PET scanner) is to this day one of the highest resolution PET scanners; thus, it can serve as useful benchmark when evaluating performance of newer scanners. Here, we report results from a cross-validation study between the HRRT and the whole-body GE SIGNA PET/MR focusing on brain imaging. Phantom data were acquired to determine recovery coefficients (RCs), % background variability (%BG), and image voxel noise (%). Cross-validation studies were performed with six healthy volunteers using [11C]DTBZ, [11C]raclopride, and [18F]FDG. Line profiles, regional time-activity curves, regional non-displaceable binding potentials (BPND) for [11C]DTBZ and [11C]raclopride scans, and radioactivity ratios for [18F]FDG scans were calculated and compared between the HRRT and the SIGNA PET/MR.

Results: Phantom data showed that the PET/MR images reconstructed with an ordered subset expectation maximization (OSEM) algorithm with time-of-flight (TOF) and TOF + point spread function (PSF) + filter revealed similar RCs for the hot spheres compared to those obtained on the HRRT reconstructed with an ordinary Poisson-OSEM algorithm with PSF and PSF + filter. The PET/MR TOF + PSF reconstruction revealed the highest RCs for all hot spheres. Image voxel noise of the PET/MR system was significantly lower. Line profiles revealed excellent spatial agreement between the two systems. BPNDvalues revealed variability of less than 10% for the [11C]DTBZ scans and 19% for [11C]raclopride (based on one subject only). Mean [18F]FDG ratios to pons showed less than 12% differences.

Conclusions: These results demonstrated comparable performances of the two systems in terms of RCs with lower voxel-level noise (%) present in the PET/MR system. Comparison of in vivo human data confirmed the comparability of the two systems. The whole-body GE SIGNA PET/MR system is well suited for high-resolution brain imaging as no significant performance degradation was found compared to that of the reference standard HRRT.

AUTHORS: Carmen Jimenez-Mesa, Juan E Arco, Francisco Jesus Martinez-Murcia, John Suckling, Javier Ramirez, Juan Manuel Gorriz

JOURNAL: Pharmacological research

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
The integration of positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging techniques with machine learning (ML) algorithms, including deep learning (DL) models, is a promising approach. This integration enhances the precision and efficiency of current diagnostic and treatment strategies while offering invaluable insights into disease mechanisms. In this comprehensive review, we delve into the transformative impact of ML and DL in this domain. Firstly, a brief analysis is provided of how these algorithms have evolved and which are the most widely applied in this domain. Their different potential applications in nuclear imaging are then discussed, such as optimization of image adquisition or reconstruction, biomarkers identification, multimodal fusion and the development of diagnostic, prognostic, and disease progression evaluation systems. This is because they are able to analyse complex patterns and relationships within imaging data, as well as extracting quantitative and objective measures. Furthermore, we discuss the challenges in implementation, such as data standardization and limited sample sizes, and explore the clinical opportunities and future horizons, including data augmentation and explainable AI. Together, these factors are propelling the continuous advancement of more robust, transparent, and reliable systems.

TITLE: [Effect of different respiratory motion correction methods on PET image quality in chest PET/MRI]

AUTHORS: H F Gu, Y Ma, S Luo, J Zhong, L Ma, J Cai, L J Zhang

JOURNAL: Zhonghua yi xue za zhi

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Objective:To investigate the effect of different respiratory motion correction methods on PET images during chest PET/MRI scans.Methods:The data of 35 patients (24 males and 11 females, aged from 29 to 84 year) of pulmonary lesions with significantly high uptake in thoracic PET/MRI scan were retrospective collected from Jingling Hospital. Four different methods were used to reconstruct the PET data. Group A was the full-time 20 min without respiratory motion correction static acquisition (Static) as a control, group B was the end-expiration static collection (Q.Static), and group C was the multi-bins respiratory gating (Gated-Respiratory). In addition, the influence of the time being considered, group D was added for reconstruction in the first 1/3 period (6 min 40 s) of group A. Then, the maximum value (L-SUVmax) and the mean value (L-SUVmean) of the SUV of the lesion, the mean value (B-SUVmean) and the standard deviation (B-SUVsd) of the SUV of the background under each reconstruction results were measured, and for each lesion the signal-to-noise ratio (L-SNR) was calculated. In order to exclude the interference of the background, the mean of the relative SUV (L-dSUVmean) of the L-SUVmeanrelative to the B-SUVmeanwas also calculated. Finally, One-Way Repeated Measures ANOVA was used, and the post-hoc pairwise comparison between groups was tested by Bonferroni's modified test.Results:There was statistically significant difference among group B or group C compared to group A and group D in L-SUVmax, L-SUVmeanand L-dSUVmean[L-SUVmax:group B vs group A or group D was 8.06±3.57 vs 7.73±3.45 or 7.61±3.50, group C vs group A or group D was 8.04±3.56 vs 7.73±3.45 or 7.61±3.50 (allP<0.05); L-SUVmean: group B vs group A or group D was 4.12±1.78 vs 3.98±1.72 or 3.91±1.71, group C vs group A or group D was 4.13±1.78 vs 3.98±1.72 or 3.91±1.71 (allP<0.05); L-dSUVmean: group B vs group A or group D was 3.52±0.16 vs 3.39±0.18 or 3.31±0.18, group C vs group A or group D was 3.53±0.18 vs 3.39±0.18 or 3.31±0.18 (allP<0.05)], but there was no statistically significant difference between group B and group C (allP>0.05). There were statistically significant differences between group D and group A in B-SUVsd(0.07±0.00 vs 0.07±0.00,P=0.023) and L-SNR (69.80±44.57 vs 85.35±68.98,P=0.001). There was no statistically significant difference between group D and group A in L-SUVmax, L-SUVmean, B-SUVmeanand L-dSUVmean(allP>0.05).Conclusions:There was no significant difference in PET image quality between the Q.static and Gated-Respiratory group, both of the two groups were better than the Static group which with no Gated-Respiratory motion correction. If non-respiratory gated Static is used, the PET acquisition time is recommended to be 6 min 40 s.

TITLE: [ 18 F]-PSMA-1007 PET imaging optimization and inter-rater reliability - a comparison of three different reconstructions read by four radiologists

AUTHORS: Olof Jonmarker, Ted Nilsson, Rimma Axelsson, Lovisa Hult Ericson, Thuy A Tran, Antonios Tzortzakakis, Irina Savitcheva, Maria Holstensson

JOURNAL: Nuclear medicine communications

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Objectives: To increase understanding of optimal imaging parameters [ 18 F]PSMA-1007 when imaging patients with prostate cancer and to determine interrater agreement using [ 18 F]PSMA-1007.

Methods: In this observational study, four independent physicians read reconstruction sets using bedtimes of 1, 2 and 3 minutes of patients undergoing [ 18 F]PSMA-1007. positron emission topography. Clear and equivocal lesions and their locations were recorded. Image noise was rated on a four-point scale. Lesion counts were compared using inter-class correlation whereas noise ratings were compared using generalized estimating equations. Repeated cases were used to assess intra-rater agreement.

Results: Sixty reconstruction sets of 16 consecutively examined participants were included. Participants had a mean age of 71.5 years, six of them were examined prior to any treatment, three had a history of radiotherapy and seven of prostatectomy. Median Gleason score of primary tumors was 7. Imaging was performed after a mean of 132 min using a mean 3.95 MBq/Kg body weight of [ 18 F] PSMA-1007. Neither the total number of lesions per location nor the proportion of equivocal lesions varied consistently between bedtimes. Inter-rater reliability scores varied depending on location from 0.40 to 1.0 and were similar for all bedtimes. Intra-rater reliability varied between 0.70 and 0.76 for the three different bedtimes. Noise ratings were significantly lower for 1 minute than 3 minutes per bed.

Conclusion: In the setting of [ 18 F]PSMA-1007 PET CT, 1, 2 and 3 minutes per bed produce similar results unlikely to affect clinical interpretation. Image noise ratings favor 2 and 3 minutes per bed.

TITLE: Generating PET Attenuation Maps via Sim2Real Deep Learning-Based Tissue Composition Estimation Combined with MLACF

ABSTRACT:
Deep learning (DL) has recently attracted attention for data processing in positron emission tomography (PET). Attenuation correction (AC) without computed tomography (CT) data is one of the interests. Here, we present, to our knowledge, the first attempt to generate an attenuation map of the human head via Sim2Real DL-based tissue composition estimation from model training using only the simulated PET dataset. The DL model accepts a two-dimensional non-attenuation-corrected PET image as input and outputs a four-channel tissue-composition map of soft tissue, bone, cavity, and background. Then, an attenuation map is generated by a linear combination of the tissue composition maps and, finally, used as input for scatter+random estimation and as an initial estimate for attenuation map reconstruction by the maximum likelihood attenuation correction factor (MLACF), i.e., the DL estimate is refined by the MLACF. Preliminary results using clinical brain PET data showed that the proposed DL model tended to estimate anatomical details inaccurately, especially in the neck-side slices. However, it succeeded in estimating overall anatomical structures, and the PET quantitative accuracy with DL-based AC was comparable to that with CT-based AC. Thus, the proposed DL-based approach combined with the MLACF is also a promising CT-less AC approach.

TITLE: Impact of point-spread function reconstruction on dynamic and static 18F-DOPA PET/CT quantitative parameters in glioma

AUTHORS: Antoine Girard, Madani François, Nibras Chaboub, Pierre-Jean Le Reste, Anne Devillers, Hervé Saint-Jalmes, Florence Le Jeune, Xavier Palard-Novello

JOURNAL: Quantitative imaging in medicine and surgery

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Background: Quantification of dynamic and static parameters extracted from 3,4-dihydroxy-6-[18F]-fluoro-L-phenylalanine (18F-DOPA, FDOPA) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) plays a critical role for glioma assessment. The objective of the present study was to investigate the impact of point-spread function (PSF) reconstruction on these quantitative parameters.

Methods: Fourteen patients with untreated gliomas and investigated with FDOPA PET/CT were analyzed. The distribution of the 14 cases was as follows: 6 astrocytomas-isocitrate dehydrogenase-mutant; 2 oligodendrogliomas/1p19q-codeleted-isocitrate dehydrogenase-mutant; and 6 isocitrate dehydrogenase-wild-type glioblastomas. A 0-20-min dynamic images (8×15, 2×30, 2×60, and 3×300 s post-injection) and a 0-20-min static image were reconstructed with and without PSF. Tumoral volumes-of-interest were generated on all of the PET series and the background volumes-of-interest were generated on the 0-20-min static image with and without PSF. Static parameters (SUVmax and SUVmean) of the tumoral and the background volumes-of-interest and kinetic parameters (K1 and k2) of the tumoral volumes-of-interest extracted from using full kinetic analysis were provided. PSF and non-PSF quantitative parameters values were compared.

Results: Thirty-three tumor volumes-of-interest and 14 background volumes-of-interest were analyzed. PSF images provided higher tumor SUVmax than non-PSF images for 23/33 VOIs [median SUVmax =3.0 (range, 1.4-10.2) with PSFvs.2.7 (range, 1.4-9.1) without PSF; P<0.001] and higher tumor SUVmean for 13/33 volumes-of-interest [median SUVmean =2.0 (range, 0.8-7.6) with PSFvs.2.0 (range, 0.8-7.4) without PSF; P=0.002]. K1 and k2 were significantly lower with PSF than without PSF [respectively median K1 =0.077 mL/ccm/min (range, 0.043-0.445 mL/ccm/min) with PSFvs.0.101 mL/ccm/min (range, 0.055-0.578 mL/ccm/min) without PSF; P<0.001 and median k2 =0.070 min-1(range, 0.025-0.146 min-1) with PSFvs.0.081 min-1(range, 0.027-0.180 min-1) without PSF; P<0.001]. Background SUVmax and SUVmean were statistically unaffected [respectively median SUVmax =1.7 (range, 1.3-2.0) with PSFvs.1.7 (range, 1.3-1.9) without PSF; P=0.346 and median SUVmean =1.5 (range, 1.0-1.8) with PSFvs.1.5 (range, 1.0-1.7) without PSF; P=0.371].

Conclusions: The present study confirms that PSF significantly increases tumor activity concentrations measured on PET images. PSF algorithms for quantitative PET/CT analysis should be used with caution, especially for quantification of kinetic parameters.

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear medicine technology

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
The 2024 update of the North American consensus guidelines for pediatric administered radiopharmaceutical activities (NAGL) is presented. Under the auspices of the Image Gently Alliance, a working group of 19 pediatric nuclear medicine experts, including clinicians, technologists, and physicists, worked for 2 y to update the 2016 NAGL, its most recent version. Building on previous success, the current recommendations regarding pediatric diagnostic nuclear medicine were reviewed systematically regarding their continued pertinence, the need for modification, and whether any recent protocols should be added. The working group reviewed and approved the 2024 update of the NAGL, and the update was subsequently approved by the Image Gently Alliance in the spring of 2024. None of the 23 protocols listed in the 2016 NAGL were removed; however, 9 were modified, and 6 new protocols (13N-NH3and83Rb for cardiac imaging;18F-DOPA,68Ga-DOTATATE,68Ga-DOTATOC, and Na123I for thyroid cancer imaging) were added. Five of 6 new protocols involve PET imaging, reflecting an increase in the routine use of PET in children in the past decade. This 2024 update addresses the impact of advances in imaging equipment, reconstruction, image processing, and clinical practice and the introduction of new radiopharmaceutical agents into the practice of pediatric nuclear medicine.

TITLE: Investigation of PET image quality with acquisition time/bed and enhancement of lesion quantification accuracy through deep progressive learning

AUTHORS: Hongxing Yang, Shihao Chen, Ming Qi, Wen Chen, Qing Kong, Jianping Zhang, Shaoli Song

JOURNAL: EJNMMI physics

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Objective: To improve the PET image quality by a deep progressive learning (DPL) reconstruction algorithm and evaluate the DPL performance in lesion quantification.

Methods: We reconstructed PET images from 48 oncological patients using ordered subset expectation maximization (OSEM) and deep progressive learning (DPL) methods. The patients were enrolled into three overlapped studies: 11 patients for image quality assessment (study 1), 34 patients for sub-centimeter lesion quantification (study 2), and 28 patients for imaging of overweight or obese individuals (study 3). In study 1, we evaluated the image quality visually based on four criteria: overall score, image sharpness, image noise, and diagnostic confidence. We also measured the image quality quantitatively using the signal-to-background ratio (SBR), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), contrast-to-background ratio (CBR), and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR). To evaluate the performance of the DPL algorithm in quantifying lesions, we compared the maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmax), SBR, CBR, SNR and CNR of 63 sub-centimeter lesions in study 2 and 44 lesions in study 3.

Results: DPL produced better PET image quality than OSEM did based on the visual evaluation methods when the acquisition time was 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 min/bed. However, no discernible differences were found between the two methods when the acquisition time was 2.0, 2.5 and 3.0 min/bed. Quantitative results showed that DPL had significantly higher values of SBR, CBR, SNR, and CNR than OSEM did for each acquisition time. For sub-centimeter lesion quantification, the SUVmax, SBR, CBR, SNR, and CNR of DPL were significantly enhanced, compared with OSEM. Similarly, for lesion quantification in overweight and obese patients, DPL significantly increased these parameters compared with OSEM.

Conclusion: The DPL algorithm dramatically enhanced the quality of PET images and enabled more accurate quantification of sub-centimeters lesions in patients and lesions in overweight or obese patients. This is particularly beneficial for overweight or obese patients who usually have lower image quality due to the increased attenuation.

TITLE: Shortened duration whole body 18F-FDG PET Patlak imaging on the Biograph Vision Quadra PET/CT using a population-averaged input function

JOURNAL: EJNMMI physics

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Background: Excellent performance characteristics of the Vision Quadra PET/CT, e.g. a substantial increase in sensitivity, allow for precise measurements of image-derived input functions (IDIF) and tissue time activity curves. Previously we have proposed a method for a reduced 30 min (as opposed to 60 min) whole body18F-FDG Patlak PET imaging procedure using a previously published population-averaged input function (PIF) scaled to IDIF values at 30-60 min post-injection (p.i.). The aim of the present study was to apply this method using the Vision Quadra PET/CT, including the use of a PIF to allow for shortened scan durations.

Methods: Twelve patients with suspected lung malignancy were included and received a weight-based injection of18F-FDG. Patients underwent a 65-min dynamic PET acquisition which were reconstructed using European Association of Nuclear Medicine Research Ltd. (EARL) standards 2 reconstruction settings. A volume of interest (VOI) was placed in the ascending aorta (AA) to obtain the IDIF. An external PIF was scaled to IDIF values at 30-60, 40-60, and 50-60 min p.i., respectively, and parametric18F-FDG influx rate constant (Ki) images were generated using a t* of 30, 40 or 50 min, respectively. Herein, tumour lesions as well as healthy tissues, i.e. liver, muscle tissue, spleen and grey matter, were segmented.

Results: Good agreement between the IDIF and corresponding PIF scaled to 30-60 min p.i. and 40-60 min p.i. was obtained with 7.38% deviation in Ki. Bland-Altman plots showed excellent agreement in Kiobtained using the PIF scaled to the IDIF at 30-60 min p.i. and at 40-60 min p.i. as all data points were within the limits of agreement (LOA) (- 0.004-0.002, bias: - 0.001); for the 50-60 min p.i. Ki, all except one data point fell in between the LOA (- 0.021-0.012, bias: - 0.005).

Conclusions: Parametric whole body18F-FDG Patlak Kiimages can be generated non-invasively on a Vision Quadra PET/CT system. In addition, using a scaled PIF allows for a substantial (factor 2 to 3) reduction in scan time without substantial loss of accuracy (7.38% bias) and precision (image quality and noise interference).

TITLE: Reproducibility of [18F]FDG PET/CT liver SUV as reference or normalisation factor

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Introduction: Although visual and quantitative assessments of [18F]FDG PET/CT studies typically rely on liver uptake value as a reference or normalisation factor, consensus or consistency in measuring [18F]FDG uptake is lacking. Therefore, we evaluate the variation of several liver standardised uptake value (SUV) measurements in lymphoma [18F]FDG PET/CT studies using different uptake metrics.

Methods: PET/CT scans from 34 lymphoma patients were used to calculate SUVmaxliver, SUVpeakliverand SUVmeanliveras a function of (1) volume-of-interest (VOI) size, (2) location, (3) imaging time point and (4) as a function of total metabolic tumour volume (MTV). The impact of reconstruction protocol on liver uptake is studied on 15 baseline lymphoma patient scans. The effect of noise on liver SUV was assessed using full and 25% count images of 15 lymphoma scans.

Results: Generally, SUVmaxliverand SUVpeakliverwere 38% and 16% higher compared to SUVmeanliver. SUVmaxliverand SUVpeakliverincreased up to 31% and 15% with VOI size while SUVmeanliverremained unchanged with the lowest variability for the largest VOI size. Liver uptake metrics were not affected by VOI location. Compared to baseline, liver uptake metrics were 15-18% and 9-18% higher at interim and EoT PET, respectively. SUVliverdecreased with larger total MTVs. SUVmaxliverand SUVpeakliverwere affected by reconstruction protocol up to 62%. SUVmax and SUVpeak moved 22% and 11% upward between full and 25% count images.

Conclusion: SUVmeanliverwas most robust against VOI size, location, reconstruction protocol and image noise level, and is thus the most reproducible metric for liver uptake. The commonly recommended 3 cm diameter spherical VOI-based SUVmeanlivervalues were only slightly more variable than those seen with larger VOI sizes and are sufficient for SUVmeanlivermeasurements in future studies.

TITLE: Gaussian position-weighted center of gravity algorithm for multiplexed readout

AUTHORS: Harutyun Poladyan, Oleksandr Bubon, Aram Teymurazyan, Sergii Senchurov, Alla Reznik

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Readout signal multiplexing is a commonly used method to reduce the electronics cost in positron emission tomography (PET) systems, and the calculation of the scintillation coordinates typically is done by using a center of gravity (CoG) technique due to its simplicity and ease of implementation. This comes with a drawback, since CoG has a non-linear response at the periphery of the detector due to the lack of weights beyond the detector. Detectors with multiplexed readout that are based on finely segmented scintillators and coarsely segmented photosensors are known to suffer from the so-called edge effect where a pile-up of the reconstructed coordinates from the edge crystals is observed. This may lead to incorrect assignment of the events to crystal pixels and result in the formation of erroneous lines of response causing a degradation of spatial resolution and reduction of image contrast. To overcome the abovementioned limitations in gamma-ray detectors with multiplexed photosensor readout, we propose to use a modified Gaussian position-weighted center of gravity (PW-CoG) technique for the calculation of gamma-ray interaction position. Here, the proposed method is applied to PET detectors with 24 [Formula: see text] 24 LYSO crystals read out by 8 [Formula: see text] 8 SiPM array with 64:16 row/column multiplexing. Furthermore, we compared the modified Gaussian PW-CoG and truncated center of gravity coordinate reconstruction methods. It was observed that both algorithms resolve peaks corresponding to events registered in the crystal pixels on the periphery of the crystal array. However peak-to-valley ratios and crystal resolvability metrics for the PW-CoG algorithm are generally greater.

TITLE: 90Y post-radioembolization clinical assessment with whole-body Biograph Vision Quadra PET/CT: image quality, tumor, liver and lung dosimetry

AUTHORS: Konstantinos G Zeimpekis, Lorenzo Mercolli, Maurizio Conti, Hasan Sari, Axel Rominger, Hendrik Rathke

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Evaluation of90Y liver radioembolization post-treatment clinical data using a whole-body Biograph Vision Quadra PET/CT to investigate the potential of protocol optimization in terms of scan time and dosimetry.

Methods: 17 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma with median (IQR) injected activity 2393 (1348-3298) MBq were included. Pre-treatment dosimetry plan was based on99mTc-MAA SPECT/CT with Simplicit90Y™ and post-treatment validation with Quadra using Simplicit90Y™ and HERMIA independently. Regarding the image analysis, mean and peak SNR, the coefficient of variation (COV) and lesion-to-background ratio (LBR) were evaluated. For the post-treatment dosimetry validation, the mean tumor, whole liver and lung absorbed dose evaluation was performed using Simplicit90Y and HERMES. Images were reconstructed with 20-, 15-, 10-, 5- and 1- min sinograms with 2, 4, 6 and 8 iterations. Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to show statistical significance (p < 0.05).

Results: There was no difference of statistical significance between 20- and 5- min reconstructed times for the peak SNR, COV and LBR. In addition, there was no difference of statistical significance between 20- and 1- min reconstructed times for all dosimetry metrics. Lung dosimetry showed consistently lower values than the expected. Tumor absorbed dose based on Simplicit90Y™ was similar to the expected while HERMES consistently underestimated significantly the measured tumor absorbed dose. Finally, there was no difference of statistical significance between expected and measured tumor, whole liver and lung dose for all reconstruction times.

Conclusion: In this study we evaluated, in terms of image quality and dosimetry, whole-body PET clinical images of patients after having been treated with90Y microspheres radioembolization for liver cancer. Compared to the 20-min standard scan, the simulated 5-min reconstructed images provided equal image peak SNR and noise behavior, while performing also similarly for post-treatment dosimetry of tumor, whole liver and lung absorbed doses.

TITLE: Fast 4D-PET parametric imaging computation at the whole field of view level: Reliability under simulated conditions of PET KinetiX, a dedicated software solution

AUTHORS: Sylvain Faure, Adrien Paillet, Claude Comtat, Florent L Besson

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: The reliability of a new academic software, PET KinetiX, designed for fast parametric 4D-PET imaging computation, is assessed under simulated conditions.

Methods: 4D-PET data were simulated using the XCAT digital phantom and realistic time-activity curves (ground truth). Four hundred analytical simulations were reconstructed using CASToR, an open-source software for tomographic reconstruction, replicating the clinical characteristics of two available PET systems with short and long axial fields of view (SAFOV and LAFOV). A total of 2,800 Patlak and 2TCM kinetic parametric maps of18F-FDG were generated using PET KinetiX. The mean biases and standard deviations of the kinetic parametric maps were computed for each tissue label and compared to the biases of unprocessed SUV data. Additionally, the mean absolute ratio of kinetic-to-SUV contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) was estimated for each tissue structure, along with the corresponding standard deviations.

Results: The Kiand vbparametric maps produced by PET KinetiX faithfully reproduced the predefined multi-tissue structures of the XCAT digital phantom for both Patlak and 2TCM models. Image definition was influenced by the 4D-PET input data: a higher number of iterations resulted in sharper rendering and higher standard deviations in PET signal characteristics. Biases relative to the ground truth varied across tissue structures and hardware configurations, similarly to unprocessed SUV data. In most tissue structures, Patlak kinetic-to-SUV CNR ratios exceeded 1 for both SAFOV and LAFOV configurations. The highest kinetic-to-SUV CNR ratio was observed in 2TCM k₃ maps within tumor regions.

Conclusion: PET KinetiX currently generates Kiand vbparametric maps that are qualitatively comparable to unprocessed SUV data, with improved CNR in most cases. The 2TCM k₃ parametric maps for tumor structures exhibited the highest CNR enhancement, warranting further evaluation across different anatomical regions and radiotracer applications.

TITLE: A deep learning-based whole-body solution for PET/MRI attenuation correction

AUTHORS: Sahar Ahangari, Anders Beck Olin, Marianne Kinggård Federspiel, Bjoern Jakoby, Thomas Lund Andersen, Adam Espe Hansen, Barbara Malene Fischer, Flemming Littrup Andersen

JOURNAL: EJNMMI physics

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Background: Deep convolutional neural networks have demonstrated robust and reliable PET attenuation correction (AC) as an alternative to conventional AC methods in integrated PET/MRI systems. However, its whole-body implementation is still challenging due to anatomical variations and the limited MRI field of view. The aim of this study is to investigate a deep learning (DL) method to generate voxel-based synthetic CT (sCT) from Dixon MRI and use it as a whole-body solution for PET AC in a PET/MRI system.

Materials and methods: Fifteen patients underwent PET/CT followed by PET/MRI with whole-body coverage from skull to feet. We performed MRI truncation correction and employed co-registered MRI and CT images for training and leave-one-out cross-validation. The network was pretrained with region-specific images. The accuracy of the AC maps and reconstructed PET images were assessed by performing a voxel-wise analysis and calculating the quantification error in SUV obtained using DL-based sCT (PETsCT) and a vendor-provided atlas-based method (PETAtlas), with the CT-based reconstruction (PETCT) serving as the reference. In addition, region-specific analysis was performed to compare the performances of the methods in brain, lung, liver, spine, pelvic bone, and aorta.

Results: Our DL-based method resulted in better estimates of AC maps with a mean absolute error of 62 HU, compared to 109 HU for the atlas-based method. We found an excellent voxel-by-voxel correlation between PETCTand PETsCT(R2= 0.98). The absolute percentage difference in PET quantification for the entire image was 6.1% for PETsCTand 11.2% for PETAtlas. The regional analysis showed that the average errors and the variability for PETsCTwere lower than PETAtlasin all regions. The largest errors were observed in the lung, while the smallest biases were observed in the brain and liver.

Conclusions: Experimental results demonstrated that a DL approach for whole-body PET AC in PET/MRI is feasible and allows for more accurate results compared with conventional methods. Further evaluation using a larger training cohort is required for more accurate and robust performance.

TITLE: Evaluation of a method based on synthetic data inserted into raw data prior to reconstruction for the assessment of PET scanners

AUTHORS: Quentin Maronnier, Frédéric Courbon, Olivier Caselles

JOURNAL: EJNMMI physics

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Background: Performance assessment of positron emission tomography (PET) scanners is crucial to guide clinical practice with efficiency. Even though clinical data are the final target, their use to characterize systems response is constrained by the lack of ground truth. Phantom tests overcome this limitation by controlling the object of study, but remain simple and are not representative of patient complexity. The objective of this study is to evaluate the accuracy of a simulation method using synthetic spheres inserted into acquired raw data prior to reconstruction, simulating multiple scenarios in comparison with equivalent physical experiments.

Methods: We defined our experimental framework using the National Electrical Manufacturers Association NU-2 2018 Image Quality standard, but replaced the standard sphere set with more appropriate sizes (4, 5, 6, 8, 10 and 13 mm) better suited to current PET scanner performance. Four experiments, with different spheres-to-background ratios (2:1, 4:1, 6:1 and 8:1), were performed. An additional dataset was acquired with a radioactive background but no activity within the spheres (water only) to establish a baseline. Then, we artificially simulated radioactive spheres to reproduce other experiments using synthetic data inserted into the original sinogram. Images were reconstructed following standard guidelines using ordered subset expectation maximization algorithm along with a Bayesian penalized likelihood algorithm. We first visually compared experimental and simulated images. Afterward, we measured the activity concentration values into the spheres to calculate the mean and maximum recovery coefficients (RCmeanand RCmax) which we used in a quantitative analysis.

Results: No significant visual differences were identified between experimental and simulated series. Mann-Whitney U tests comparing simulated and experimental distributions showed no statistical differences for both RCmean(P value = 0.611) and RCmax(P value = 0.720). Spearman tests revealed high correlation for RCmean(ρ = 0.974, P value < 0.001) and RCmax(ρ = 0.974, P value < 0.001) between both datasets. From Bland-Altman plots, we highlighted slight shifts in RCmeanand RCmaxof, respectively, 2.1 ± 16.9% and 3.3 ± 22.3%.

Conclusions: We evaluated the efficiency of our hybrid method in faithfully mimicking practical situations producing satisfactory results compared to equivalent experimental data.

TITLE: Ultra-low-dose CT for attenuation correction: dose savings and effect on PET quantification for protocols with and without tin filter

AUTHORS: Natalie Anne Bebbington, Kenneth Boye Christensen, Lone Lange Østergård, Paw Christian Holdgaard

JOURNAL: EJNMMI physics

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Background: Ultra-low-dose (ULD) computed tomography (CT) scans should be used when CT is performed only for attenuation correction (AC) of positron emission tomography (PET) data. A tin filter can be used in addition to the standard aluminium bowtie filter to reduce CT radiation dose to patients. The aim was to determine how low CT doses can be, when utilised for PET AC, with and without the tin filter, whilst providing adequate PET quantification.

Methods: A water-filled NEMA image quality phantom was imaged in three configurations with18F-FDG: (1) water only (0HU); (2) with cylindrical insert containing homogenous mix of sand, flour and water (SFW, approximately 475HU); (3) with cylindrical insert containing sand (approximately 1100HU). Each underwent one-bed-position (26.3 cm) PET-CT comprising 1 PET and 13 CT acquisitions. CT acquisitions with tube current modulation were performed at 120 kV/50 mAs-ref (reference standard), 100 kV/7 mAs-ref (standard ULDCT for PET AC protocol), Sn140kV (mAs range 7-50-ref) and Sn100kV (mAs range 12-400-ref). PET data were reconstructed with μ-maps provided by each CT dataset, and PET activity concentration measured in each reconstruction. Differences in CT dose length product (DLP) and PET quantification were determined relative to the reference standard.

Results: At each tube voltage, changes in PET quantification were greater with increasing density and reducing mAs. Compared with the reference standard, differences in PET quantification for the standard ULDCT protocol for the three phantoms were ≤ 1.7%, with the water phantom providing a DLP of 7mGy.cm. With tin filter at Sn100kV, differences in PET quantification were negligible (≤ 1.2%) for all phantoms down to 50mAs-ref, proving a DLP of 2.8mGy.cm, at 60% dose reduction compared with standard ULDCT protocol. Below 50mAs-ref, differences in PET quantification were > 2% for at least one phantom (2.3% at 25mAs-ref in SFW; 6.4% at 12mAs-ref in sand). At Sn140kV/7mAs-ref, quantification differences were ≤ 0.6% in water, giving 3.8mGy.cm DLP, but increased to > 2% at bone-equivalent densities.

Conclusions: CT protocols for PET AC can provide ultra-low doses with adequate PET quantification. The tin filter can allow 60-87% lower dose than the standard ULDCT protocol for PET AC, depending on tissue density and accepted change in PET quantification.

TITLE: 18F-NaF PET/CT of Obese Patients on a Lutetium-Yttrium Oxyorthosilicate PET/CT System: Patient Dosimetry, Optimization of Injected Activity, and Acquisition Time

AUTHORS: Sharjeel Usmani, Najeeb Ahmed, Gopinath Gnanasegaran, Ahmed Musbah, Fareeda Al Kandari, Tim Van den Wyngaert

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear medicine technology

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
18F-NaF PET/CT has a rapid single-pass extraction and fast clearance from soft tissues, resulting in a good target-to-background ratio. This study aimed to establish the optimum acquisition time and dosimetry for18F-NaF PET/CT to evaluate bone metastases in obese patients. A secondary objective was to evaluate the impact of acquisition time on image quality, lesion detection rate, noise level, and radiation burden in this patient group.Methods:In total, 60 patients were included in the study (20 patients with a body mass index (BMI) of 30.0-34.9 kg/m2, 20 with a BMI of 35-39.9 kg/m2, and 20 with a BMI of >40 kg/m2). Images were acquired after intravenous injection of a 2.2 MBq/kg (0.06 mCi/kg) dose of18F-NaF. Data were acquired in list mode using ordered-subset expectation maximization reconstruction. The raw data were rebinned to simulate scans with acquisition times of 2, 2.5, and 3 min per bed position. The scans were visually analyzed by 2 observers and scored by rank against a panel of parameters (overall image quality, noise level, background soft tissue, and lesion detectability), and the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) was calculated.Results:The mean CNR was 20.19 ± 8.39 for a 2-min acquisition, 21.03 ± 8.35 for 2.5 min, and 22.16 ± 8.37 for 3 min. There were no statistically significant differences in CNR among the 3 different acquisition durations (P> 0.05). Lesion delineation was excellent and independent of the acquisition time. All relevant lesions could be identified with all 3 acquisition times. A mean activity of 215.4 ± 31.3 MBq was injected, with estimated mean effective absorbed doses of 4.09 ± 0.59 mSv for18F-NaF PET and 7.88 ± 1.66 mSv for CT alone.Conclusion:18F-NaF PET/CT can be beneficial in obese patients because of its good pharmacokinetics. Optimal osseous staging can be achieved with relatively low doses and radiation burden. Lesion delineation was excellent regardless of acquisition time. However, it is recommended that an acquisition of 3 min per bed position be used in patients with a BMI of more than 40.

TITLE: Clinical Evaluation of a Data-Driven Respiratory Gating Algorithm for Whole-Body PET with Continuous Bed Motion

AUTHORS: Florian Büther, Judson Jones, Robert Seifert, Lars Stegger, Paul Schleyer, Michael Schäfers

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Respiratory gating is the standard to prevent respiration effects from degrading image quality in PET. Data-driven gating (DDG) using signals derived from PET raw data is a promising alternative to gating approaches requiring additional hardware (e.g., pressure-sensitive belt gating [BG]). However, continuous-bed-motion (CBM) scans require dedicated DDG approaches for axially extended PET, compared with DDG for conventional step-and-shoot scans. In this study, a CBM-capable DDG algorithm was investigated in a clinical cohort and compared with BG using optimally gated (OG) and fully motion-corrected (elastic motion correction [EMOCO]) reconstructions.Methods:Fifty-six patients with suspected malignancies in the thorax or abdomen underwent whole-body18F-FDG CBM PET/CT using DDG and BG. Correlation analyses were performed on both gating signals. Besides static reconstructions, OG and EMOCO reconstructions were used for BG and DDG. The metabolic volume, SUVmax, and SUVmeanof lesions were compared among the reconstructions. Additionally, the quality of lesion delineation in the different PET reconstructions was independently evaluated by 3 experts.Results:The global correlation coefficient between BG and DDG signals was 0.48 ± 0.11, peaking at 0.89 ± 0.07 when scanning the kidney and liver region. In total, 196 lesions were analyzed. SUV measurements were significantly higher in BG-OG, DDG-OG, BG-EMOCO, and DDG-EMOCO than in static images (P< 0.001; median SUVmax: static, 14.3 ± 13.4; BG-EMOCO, 19.8 ± 15.7; DDG-EMOCO, 20.5 ± 15.6; BG-OG, 19.6 ± 17.1; and DDG-OG, 18.9 ± 16.6). No significant differences between BG-OG and DDG-OG or between BG-EMOCO and DDG-EMOCO were found. Visual lesion delineation was significantly better in BG-EMOCO and DDG-EMOCO than in static reconstructions (P< 0.001); no significant difference was found when comparing BG and DDG for either EMOCO or OG reconstruction.Conclusion:DDG-based motion compensation of CBM PET acquisitions outperforms static reconstructions, delivering qualities comparable to BG approaches. The new algorithm may be a valuable alternative for CBM PET systems.

TITLE: Quantitative and Visual Benefits of Data-Driven Motion Correction on Oncologic PET/CT: A Prospective Cross-sectional Study

AUTHORS: Semra Ince, M Allan Thomas, Malak Itani, Christopher Swingle, Richard Laforest, Adeel Haq, Genevieve Muñoz, Saeed Ashrafinia, Paul Schleyer, Richard L Wahl, Tyler J Fraum

JOURNAL: Academic radiology

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Rationale and objective: Conventional positron emission tomography (PET) respiratory gating utilizes a fraction of acquired PET counts (i.e., optimal gate [OG]), whereas elastic motion correction with deblurring (EMCD) utilizes all PET counts to reconstruct motion-corrected images without increasing image noise. Our aim was to assess the quantitative and visual impacts of EMCD-based motion correction on FDG-PET and DOTATATE-PET images relative to OG and ungated (UG) images.

Materials and methods: This prospective, single-center study enrolled adults undergoing FDG or DOTATATE oncologic PET/CT between June 2020 and October 2022. Subjects underwent a standard-of-care (SOC) PET acquisition while wearing a respiratory gating belt. UG, belt-gating-derived optimal gate (BG-OG), EMCD utilizing belt gating (BG-EMCD), and EMCD utilizing data-driven gating (DDG-EMCD) images were reconstructed. Tracer-avid lesions in the lower chest or upper abdomen were segmented. Quantitative metrics were extracted. Two independent, blinded readers assessed image quality via a 4-point scale and counted lesions on each reconstruction. Differences between reconstructions were assessed via the Wilcoxon signed-rank test (alpha, 0.05).

Results: This study enrolled 78 subjects; 36 subjects (mean age, 64.8 years; 20 males) with 136 tracer-avid lesions were analyzed. Data provided are medians across all tracers. Lesion SUV-max was significantly higher (P<0.001) on motion-corrected images (BG-OG: 10.77, BG-EMCD: 10.75, DDG-EMCD: 10.74) than UG images (9.00). Lesion contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs) were significantly lower (P<0.001) for BG-OG (6.31) and UG images (7.89) than BG-EMCD (9.14) and DDG-EMCD (8.89) images. FDG and DOTATATE subgroup analyses produced similar results. Among motion-corrected images, both readers preferred EMCD-based images to BG-OG images for all tracers (P<0.001) and both subgroups. EMCD-based images occasionally demonstrated more tracer-avid lesions than BG-OG or UG images.

Conclusion: EMCD-based motion correction beneficially impacts lesion quantitation (including higher SUVs and CNRs) and overall image quality.

Clinical impact: When employed on capable scanners, EMCD can improve the quality of oncologic PET imaging.

TITLE: High Physiological 18 F-FDG Uptake in Normal Pituitary Gland on Digital PET Scanner

AUTHORS: Anjali Jain, Sharjeel Usmani, Khulood Al Riyami, Avni Mittal, Sofiullah Abubakar, Asiya Al Busaidi, Subhash Chand Kheruka, Rashid Al Sukaiti

JOURNAL: World journal of nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
PurposeRecently developed digital positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scanners (digital PET [dPET]) have given new dimensions to molecular imaging. dPET scanner has very high sensitivity, spatial resolution, and image contrast that leads to increased uptake of signal in small-volume structures like pituitary gland (PG) making them visible on PET/CT scan even in absence of any pathology. Adequate knowledge of physiological fluoro-2 deoxy D glucose uptake in PG is required in interpretation of dPET for correct diagnosis and reducing unnecessary additional imaging. The aim of this study is to evaluate the frequency of physiological PG uptake on dPET.Material and MethodsEighty-eight subjects (mean age, 54.44 ± 14.18 years; range, 26-84 years; 63 females and 25 males) with normal PG on magnetic resonance imaging brain and imaged within 6 months on dPET were included in this research study. Out of 88 patients, 20 control subjects (mean age, 58.15 ± 11.08 years: 15 females and 5 males) underwent PET/CT on conventional PET. All images were acquired with similar and standard acquisition protocol and reconstruction done with Time of flight with Point spread function. PG uptake was compared visually and quantitatively.ResultsPG uptake was seen in 43 patients (48.8%). Out of 43 patients, 31 (72%) showed low uptake, 11 (26%) showed intermediate grade of uptake, and 1 patient (2%) showed intermediate-to-high uptake and was categorized as high-grade uptake. In the control group of 20 patients, 3 (15%) showed low uptake, while none of them showed intermediate or high uptake.ConclusionPhysiological PG uptake is commonly seen on dPET. Low-to-intermediate grade of PG uptake on dPET in an asymptomatic patient is physiological and does not require further evaluation and should be reported with caution.

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
The reference standard for amyloid-PET quantification requires structural MRI (sMRI) for preprocessing in both multi-site research studies and clinical trials. Here we describe rPOP (robust PET-Only Processing), a MATLAB-based MRI-free pipeline implementing non-linear warping and differential smoothing of amyloid-PET scans performed with any of the FDA-approved radiotracers (18F-florbetapir/FBP,18F-florbetaben/FBB or18F-flutemetamol/FLUTE). Each image undergoes spatial normalization based on weighted PET templates and data-driven differential smoothing, then allowing users to perform their quantification of choice. Prior to normalization, users can choose whether to automatically reset the origin of the image to the center of mass or proceed with the pipeline with the image as it is. We validate rPOP with n = 740 (514 FBP, 182 FBB, 44 FLUTE) amyloid-PET scans from the Imaging Dementia-Evidence for Amyloid Scanning - Brain Health Registry sub-study (IDEAS-BHR) and n = 1,518 scans from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (n = 1,249 FBP, n = 269 FBB), including heterogeneous acquisition and reconstruction protocols. After running rPOP, a standard quantification to extract Standardized Uptake Value ratios and the respective Centiloids conversion was performed. rPOP-based amyloid status (using an independent pathology-based threshold of ≥24.4 Centiloid units) was compared with either local visual reads (IDEAS-BHR, n = 663 with complete valid data and reads available) or with amyloid status derived from an MRI-based PET processing pipeline (ADNI, thresholds of >20/>18 Centiloids for FBP/FBB). Finally, within the ADNI dataset, we tested the linear associations between rPOP- and MRI-based Centiloid values. rPOP achieved accurate warping for N = 2,233/2,258 (98.9%) in the first pass. Of the N = 25 warping failures, 24 were rescued with manual reorientation and origin reset prior to warping. We observed high concordance between rPOP-based amyloid status and both visual reads (IDEAS-BHR, Cohen's k = 0.72 [0.7-0.74], ∼86% concordance) or MRI-pipeline based amyloid status (ADNI, k = 0.88 [0.87-0.89], ∼94% concordance). rPOP- and MRI-pipeline based Centiloids were strongly linearly related (R2:0.95, p<0.001), with this association being significantly modulated by estimated PET resolution (β= -0.016, p<0.001). rPOP provides reliable MRI-free amyloid-PET warping and quantification, leveraging widely available software and only requiring an attenuation-corrected amyloid-PET image as input. The rPOP pipeline enables the comparison and merging of heterogeneous datasets and is publicly available at https://github.com/leoiacca/rPOP.

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
An avalanche photodiode (APD)-based small animal positron emission tomography (PET)-insert was fully evaluated for its PET performance, as well as potential influences on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performance. This PET-insert has an extended axial field of view (FOV) compared with the previous design to increase system sensitivity, as well as an updated cooling and temperature regulation to enable stable and reproducible PET acquisitions. The PET performance was evaluated according to the National Electrical Manufacturers Association NU4-2008 protocol. The energy and timing resolution's full width at half maximum were 16.1% and 4.7 ns, respectively. The reconstructed radial spatial resolution of the PET-insert was 1.8 mm full width at half maximum at the center FOV using filtered back projection for reconstruction and sensitivity was 3.68%. The peak noise equivalent count rates were 70 kcps for a rat-like and 350 kcps for a mouse-like phantom, respectively. Image quality phantom values and contrast recovery were comparable to state-of-the art PET-inserts and standalone systems. Regarding MR compatibility, changes in the mean signal-to-noise ratio for turbo spin echo and echo-planar imaging sequences were below 8.6%, for gradient echo sequences below 1%. Degradation of the mean homogeneity was below 2.3% for all tested sequences. The influence of the PET-insert on theB0maps was negligible and no influence on functional MRI sequences was detected. A mouse and rat imaging study demonstrated the feasibility ofin vivosimultaneous PET/MRI.

TITLE: Standardization of PET/CT Performance Requirements for Whole-Body Quantitative Imaging: An International Proposal

AUTHORS: John J Sunderland, Ronald Boellaard, John C Dickson, Stephen A Graves, Dale L Bailey

JOURNAL: Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Currently, PET scanner validation phantoms, methods, and acceptance criteria for clinical trials are not standardized. This situation generates substantial inefficiencies with many scanners being tested multiple times for different trials. Herein we propose a standardized PET scanner validation paradigm for clinical trials.Methods:At present, active PET scanner validation programs administered by the European Association of Nuclear Medicine Research Ltd. (EARL), the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging Clinical Trials Network (CTN), and Australia New Zealand Society of Nuclear Medicine Australasian Radiopharmaceutical Trials Network are reviewed in detail to identify similarities, differences, strengths, and weaknesses. PET criteria that help define the quantitative performance characteristics most critical for clinical trials are identified. Historical quantitative scanner performance capabilities are reviewed, including increasing availability of primary and secondary standard activity measurements for calibration purposes. Methodologies for these phantom-based measurements are reviewed, and standardized approaches are recommended.Results:Phantom requirements, acquisitions, reconstruction, analysis, and acceptance criteria have all been developed to be reasonably aligned with current standard scanner validation approaches, while at the same time recommending improvements and clarifications where programmatic differences were identified. A scanner validation program based on the measurement of radionuclide specific scanner calibration and harmonized recovery coefficient performance is proposed. Quarterly calibration verification of18F and annual calibration of other radionuclides are recommended. Accuracy of ±5% for18F calibration and ±10% for other radionuclides are proposed acceptance criteria. Annual verification of EARL 2-concordant recovery coefficient performance using a National Electrical Manufacturers Association NU2 image quality phantom or CTN5 phantom imaged at an 8:1 target-to-background contrast is recommended, although contrast recovery coefficients, rather than recovery coefficients, are advised.Conclusion:An internationally standardized PET scanner validation paradigm is proposed. International adoption of such a system combined with a data-sharing system would create a more efficient, robust, uniform, and trustworthy scanner validation environment for clinical trials while improving clinical trial qualification efficiency, decreasing costs and mitigating duplication of testing.

JOURNAL: EJNMMI physics

YEAR: 2025

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: To evaluate variations in acquisition and processing protocols for four of the most common PET/CT examinations in Dutch hospitals: FDG-WB, [18F]F-PSMA, [68Ga]Ga-PSMA, and FDG-Brain.

Methods: All nuclear medicine departments in the Netherlands with a PET/CT scanner were invited to participate in a survey about acquisition and processing protocols for FDG-WB, [18F]F-PSMA, [68Ga]Ga-PSMA, and FDG-Brain PET/CT examinations. The survey collected data on injected activity, acquisition times, and reconstruction/post-processing settings. From these data, we analyzed the weight-dependent injected activity, acquisition count statistics, and correlations with scanner performance (NEMA sensitivity).

Results: A total of 42 hospitals responded (including all Dutch University Medical Centers), providing data from 58 PET/CT systems spanning 11 different models from 4 vendors. Injected activity and scan duration varied widely across hospitals, even for the same scanner model and examination type. A moderate negative correlation was observed between scanner sensitivity and the normalized injected activity × scan duration product for FDG-WB (R2= 0.50, slope = - 186.5) and FDG-brain (R2= 0.33, slope = - 180.8), suggesting that hospitals using higher-sensitivity scanners tend to reduce either injected activity or scan duration to maintain comparable acquisition counts. For [18F]F-PSMA (R2= 0.24, slope = - 62.6), the trend was less pronounced, indicating greater variability in how PET/CT centers adjust injected activity and scan duration for these tracers. In contrast, for [68Ga]Ga-PSMA (R2= 0.04, slope = - 28.3), no significant correlation was found, suggesting that scanner sensitivity plays a minimal role in protocol selection for these examinations. The observed variations in injected activity led to differences in patient radiation dose by a factor of 4 for FDG-WB, more than a factor of 10 for PSMA, and a factor of 5 for FDG-brain scans. These differences persist even after accounting for scan duration, scanner sensitivity, and overlap between scanning positions, highlighting substantial inconsistencies in PET/CT imaging protocols across Dutch hospitals.

Conclusion: The main objective of this survey was to determine the current state of practice in the Netherlands for three common PET/CT examinations. We observed variations in the injected activity for all PET/CT exam types, even within the same scanner model, that cannot be explained by taking into account differences in scanning times or uptake times. The direct implication of the observed variation in injected activity is a similar variation in radiation dose to the patient. We observed differences in dose to the patient of up to a factor 4 for FDG-WB, more than a factor of 5for [18F]F-PSMA, a factor of 4 for [68Ga]Ga-PSMA, and up to a factor of 5 for FDG-brain scans. Variations in count statistics, reconstruction, and processing settings for similar-weight patients on comparable PET/CT systems should be further investigated for their impact on lesion detectability.

TITLE: Design and Performance Evaluation of SiPM-based High-resolution Dedicated Brain Positron Emission Tomography Scanner: A Simulation Study

AUTHORS: Tahereh Zare, Peyman Sheikhzadeh, Behnoosh Teimourian Fard, Pardis Ghafarian, Mohammad Reza Ay

JOURNAL: Journal of medical physics

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Purpose/aim: The increasing population age highlights the critical need for early brain disease diagnosis, especially in disorders such as dementia. Consequently, a notable focus has been on developing dedicated brain positron emission tomography (PET) scanners, which offer higher resolution and sensitivity than whole-body PET scanners. This study aims to design and performance evaluation of an LYSO-based dedicated brain PET scanner.

Materials and methods: We developed a dedicated brain PET using Monte Carlo simulation based on cylindrical geometry. Each detector block consisted of a 23 × 23 array of 2 mm × 2 mm × 15 mm LYSO crystals coupled with SiPM. The performance of this scanner was evaluated based on the NEMA NU-2-2018 standard, focusing on analyzing various energy windows and coincidence time windows (CTWs).

Results: The results demonstrated that the noise equivalent count rate (NECR) peaked at each CTW in the 408-680 keV energy window. In addition, increasing the CTWs from 3 ns to 10 ns resulted in a decrease of 9% in sensitivity and an increase of 63% in NECR. Furthermore, the study findings highlight that using a time-of-flight (TOF) resolution of 250 ps can substantially improve image contrast relative to non-TOF reconstruction.

Conclusions: We conclude that employing a broader energy window and a narrower CTW can significantly enhance the scanner's performance regarding sensitivity and NECR. Furthermore, incorporating LYSO pixelated crystals with TOF information will facilitate the generation of high-resolution and high-contrast images.

TITLE: From a PMT-based to a SiPM-based PET system: a study to define matched acquisition/reconstruction parameters and NEMA performance of the Biograph Vision 450

AUTHORS: Thomas Carlier, Ludovic Ferrer, Maurizio Conti, Caroline Bodet-Milin, Caroline Rousseau, Yanic Bercier, Bernard Bendriem, Françoise Kraeber-Bodéré

JOURNAL: EJNMMI physics

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Background: The purpose of this work was to propose an approach based on noise measurement to adapt present clinical acquisition and reconstruction parameters adapted to a PMT-based system (Biograph mCT) to a SiPM-based system (Biograph Vision 450) sharing identical geometrical properties. The NEMA performance (NEMA) of the recently released Biograph Vision 450 PET/CT (Vision) was also derived.

Methods: All measurements were conducted on Vision and Biograph mCT with TrueV (mCT). A full NEMA-based performance was derived for Vision only. The adaptation of acquisition and reconstruction parameters from mCT to Vision was done using the NEMA image quality phantom. The noise level reached using mCT was set as the reference value for six different numbers of net true coincidences. The noise level computed using Vision was matched to the reference noise level (within 0.01%) using a different reconstruction set-up to determine the potential reduction of count numbers for the same noise level.

Results: Vision sensitivity was 9.1 kcps/MBq for a timing resolution of 213 ps at 5.3 kBq/mL. The NEMA-based CR for the 10-mm sphere was better than 75% regardless the reconstruction set-up studied. The mCT reference noise properties could be achieved using Vision with a scan time reduction (STR) of 1.34 with four iterations and a 440 × 440 matrix size (or STR = 1.89 with a 220 × 220 matrix size) together with a 3D CR improvement of 53% for the 10-mm sphere (24% using 220 × 220).

Conclusion: The Vision exhibited improved NEMA performances compared to mCT. Using the proposed approach, the time acquisition could be divided by almost two, while keeping the same noise properties as that of mCT with a marked improvement of contrast recovery.

TITLE: Phasic pressure measurements for coronary and valvular interventions using fluid-filled catheters: Errors, automated correction, and clinical implications

AUTHORS: Daniel T Johnson, Stephane Fournier, Richard L Kirkeeide, Bernard De Bruyne, K Lance Gould, Nils P Johnson

JOURNAL: Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Objectives: We sought to develop an automatic method for correcting common errors in phasic pressure tracings for physiology-guided interventions on coronary and valvular stenosis.

Background: Effective coronary and valvular interventions rely on accurate hemodynamic assessment. Phasic (subcycle) indexes remain intrinsic to valvular stenosis and are emerging for coronary stenosis. Errors, corrections, and clinical implications of fluid-filled catheter phasic pressure assessments have not been assessed in the current era of ubiquitous, high-fidelity pressure wire sensors.

Methods: We recruited patients undergoing invasive coronary physiology assessment. Phasic aortic pressure signals were recorded simultaneously using a fluid-filled guide catheter and 0.014″ pressure wire before and after standard calibration as well as after pullback. We included additional subjects undergoing hemodynamic assessment before and after transcatheter aortic valve implantation. Using the pressure wire as reference standard, we developed an automatic algorithm to match phasic pressures.

Results: Removing pressure offset and temporal shift produced the largest improvements in root mean square (RMS) error between catheter and pressure wire signals. However, further optimization <1 mmHg RMS error was possible by accounting for differential gain and the oscillatory behavior of the fluid-filled guide. The impact of correction was larger for subcycle (like systole or diastole) versus whole-cycle metrics, indicating a key role for valvular stenosis and emerging coronary pressure ratios.

Conclusions: When calibrating phasic aortic pressure signals using a pressure wire, correction requires these parameters: offset, timing, gain, and oscillations (frequency and damping factor). Automatically eliminating common errors may improve some clinical decisions regarding physiology-based intervention.

ABSTRACT:
Background: Image optimization is a key step in clinical nuclear medicine, and phantoms play an essential role in this process. However, most phantoms do not accurately reflect the complexity of human anatomy, and this presents a particular challenge when imaging endocrine glands to detect small (often subcentimeter) tumors. To address this, we developed a novel phantom for optimization of positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of the human pituitary gland. Using radioactive 3D printing, phantoms were created which mimicked the distribution of11C-methionine in normal pituitary tissue and in a small tumor embedded in the gland (i.e., with no inactive boundary, thereby reproducing the in vivo situation). In addition, an anatomical phantom, replicating key surrounding structures [based on computed tomography (CT) images from an actual patient], was created using material extrusion 3D printing with specialized filaments that approximated the attenuation properties of bone and soft tissue.

Results: The phantom enabled us to replicate pituitary glands harboring tumors of varying sizes (2, 4 and 6 mm diameters) and differing radioactive concentrations (2 ×, 5 × and 8 × the normal gland). The anatomical phantom successfully approximated the attenuation properties of surrounding bone and soft tissue. Two iterative reconstruction algorithms [ordered subset expectation maximization (OSEM); Bayesian penalized likelihood (BPL)] with a range of reconstruction parameters (e.g., 3, 5, 7 and 9 OSEM iterations with 24 subsets; BPL regularization parameter (β) from 50 to 1000) were tested. Images were analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively by eight expert readers. Quantitatively, signal was the highest using BPL with β = 50; noise was the lowest using BPL with β = 1000; contrast was the highest using BPL with β = 100. The qualitative review found that accuracy and confidence were the highest when using BPL with β = 400.

Conclusions: The development of a bespoke phantom has allowed the identification of optimal parameters for molecular pituitary imaging: BPL reconstruction with TOF, PSF correction and a β value of 400; in addition, for small (< 4 mm) tumors with low contrast (2:1 or 5:1), sensitivity may be improved using a β value of 100. Together, these findings should increase tumor detection and confidence in reporting scans.

TITLE: CT-based radiomics model using stability selection for predicting the World Health Organization/International Society of Urological Pathology grade of clear cell renal cell carcinoma

AUTHORS: Haijie Zhang, Fu Yin, Menglin Chen, Anqi Qi, Liyang Yang, Ge Wen

JOURNAL: The British journal of radiology

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Objectives: This study aimed to develop a model to predict World Health Organization/International Society of Urological Pathology (WHO/ISUP) low-grade or high-grade clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) using 3D multiphase enhanced CT radiomics features (RFs).

Methods: CT data of 138 low-grade and 60 high-grade ccRCC cases were included. RFs were extracted from four CT phases: non-contrast phase (NCP), corticomedullary phase, nephrographic phase, and excretory phase (EP). Models were developed using various combinations of RFs and subjected to cross-validation.

Results: There were 107 RFs extracted from each phase of the CT images. The NCP-EP model had the best overall predictive value (AUC = 0.78), but did not significantly differ from that of the NCP model (AUC = 0.76). By considering the predictive ability of the model, the level of radiation exposure, and model simplicity, the overall best model was the Conventional image and clinical features (CICFs)-NCP model (AUC = 0.77; sensitivity 0.75, specificity 0.69, positive predictive value 0.85, negative predictive value 0.54, accuracy 0.73). The second-best model was the NCP model (AUC = 0.76).

Conclusions: Combining clinical features with unenhanced CT images of the kidneys seems to be optimal for prediction of WHO/ISUP grade of ccRCC. This noninvasive method may assist in guiding more accurate treatment decisions for ccRCC.

Advances in knowledge: This study innovatively employed stability selection for RFs, enhancing model reliability. The CICFs-NCP model's simplicity and efficacy mark a significant advancement, offering a practical tool for clinical decision-making in ccRCC management.

JOURNAL: European radiology experimental

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
This review aims to take a journey into the transformative impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. To this scope, a broad overview of AI applications in the field of nuclear medicine and a thorough exploration of deep learning (DL) implementations in cancer diagnosis and therapy through PET imaging will be presented. We firstly describe the behind-the-scenes use of AI for image generation, including acquisition (event positioning, noise reduction though time-of-flight estimation and scatter correction), reconstruction (data-driven and model-driven approaches), restoration (supervised and unsupervised methods), and motion correction. Thereafter, we outline the integration of AI into clinical practice through the applications to segmentation, detection and classification, quantification, treatment planning, dosimetry, and radiomics/radiogenomics combined to tumour biological characteristics. Thus, this review seeks to showcase the overarching transformation of the field, ultimately leading to tangible improvements in patient treatment and response assessment. Finally, limitations and ethical considerations of the AI application to PET imaging and future directions of multimodal data mining in this discipline will be briefly discussed, including pressing challenges to the adoption of AI in molecular imaging such as the access to and interoperability of huge amount of data as well as the "black-box" problem, contributing to the ongoing dialogue on the transformative potential of AI in nuclear medicine.Relevance statementAI is rapidly revolutionising the world of medicine, including the fields of radiology and nuclear medicine. In the near future, AI will be used to support healthcare professionals. These advances will lead to improvements in diagnosis, in the assessment of response to treatment, in clinical decision making and in patient management.Key points• Applying AI has the potential to enhance the entire PET imaging pipeline.• AI may support several clinical tasks in both PET diagnosis and prognosis.• Interpreting the relationships between imaging and multiomics data will heavily rely on AI.

TITLE: Characterization of the partial volume effect along the axial field-of-view of the Biograph Vision Quadra total-body PET/CT system for multiple isotopes

AUTHORS: Julia G Mannheim, Ivo Rausch, Maurizio Conti, Christian la Fougère, Fabian P Schmidt

JOURNAL: EJNMMI physics

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Background: Total-body PET scanners with axial field of views (FOVs) longer than 1 m enable new applications to study multiple organs (e.g., the brain-gut-axis) simultaneously. As the spatial resolution and the associated partial volume effect (PVE) can vary significantly along the FOV, detailed knowledge of the contrast recovery coefficients (CRCs) is a prerequisite for image analysis and interpretation of quantitative results. The aim of this study was to determine the CRCs, as well as voxel noise, for multiple isotopes throughout the 1.06 m axial FOV of the Biograph Vision Quadra PET/CT system (Siemens Healthineers).

Materials and methods: Cylindrical phantoms equipped with three different sphere sizes (inner diameters 7.86 mm, 28 and 37 mm) were utilized for the PVE evaluation. The 7.86 mm sphere was filled with F-18 (8:1 and 4:1), Ga-68 (8:1) and Zr-89 (8:1). The 28 mm and 37 mm spheres were filled with F-18 (8:1). Background concentration in the respective phantoms was of ~ 3 kBq/ml. The phantoms were measured at multiple positions in the FOV (axial: 0, 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 cm, transaxial: 0, 10, 20 cm). The data were reconstructed with the standard clinical protocol, including PSF correction and TOF information with up to 10 iterations for maximum ring differences (MRDs) of 85 and 322; CRCs, as well as voxel noise levels, were determined for each position.

Results: F-18 CRCs (SBR 8:1 and 4:1) of the 7.86 mm sphere decreased up to 18% from the center FOV (cFOV) toward the transaxial edge and increased up to 17% toward the axial edge. Noise levels were below 15% for the default clinical reconstruction parameters. The larger spheres exhibited a similar pattern. Zr-89 revealed ~ 10% lower CRCs than F-18 but larger noise (9.1% (F-18), 19.1% (Zr-89); iteration 4, cFOV) for the default reconstruction. Zr-89 noise levels in the cFOV significantly decreased (~ 28%) when reconstructing the data with MRD322 compared with MRD85 along with a slight decrease in CRC values. Ga-68 exhibited the lowest CRCs for the three isotopes and noise characteristics comparable to those of F-18.

Conclusions: Distinct differences in the PVE within the FOV were detected for clinically relevant isotopes F-18, Ga-68 and Zr-89, as well as for different sphere sizes. Depending on the positions inside the FOV, the sphere-to-background ratios, count statistics and isotope used, this can result in an up to 50% difference between CRCs. Hence, these changes in PVE can significantly affect the quantitative analysis of patient data. MRD322 resulted in slightly lower CRC values, especially in the center FOV, whereas the voxel noise significantly decreased compared with MRD85.

TITLE: Radiomics feature reliability assessed by intraclass correlation coefficient: a systematic review

AUTHORS: Cindy Xue, Jing Yuan, Gladys G Lo, Amy T Y Chang, Darren M C Poon, Oi Lei Wong, Yihang Zhou, Winnie C W Chu

JOURNAL: Quantitative imaging in medicine and surgery

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Radiomics research is rapidly growing in recent years, but more concerns on radiomics reliability are also raised. This review attempts to update and overview the current status of radiomics reliability research in the ever expanding medical literature from the perspective of a single reliability metric of intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). To conduct this systematic review, Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed. After literature search and selection, a total of 481 radiomics studies using CT, PET, or MRI, covering a wide range of subject and disease types, were included for review. In these highly heterogeneous studies, feature reliability to image segmentation was much more investigated than reliability to other factors, such as image acquisition, reconstruction, post-processing, and feature quantification. The reported ICCs also suggested high radiomics feature reliability to image segmentation. Image acquisition was found to introduce much more feature variability than image segmentation, in particular for MRI, based on the reported ICC values. Image post-processing and feature quantification yielded different levels of radiomics reliability and might be used to mitigate image acquisition-induced variability. Some common flaws and pitfalls in ICC use were identified, and suggestions on better ICC use were given. Due to the extremely high study heterogeneities and possible risks of bias, the degree of radiomics feature reliability that has been achieved could not yet be safely synthesized or derived in this review. More future researches on radiomics reliability are warranted.

TITLE: A proof-of-concept study of an in-situ partial-ring time-of-flight PET scanner for proton beam verification

AUTHORS: Srilalan Krishnamoorthy, Boon-Keng K Teo, Wei Zou, James McDonough, Joel S Karp, Suleman Surti

JOURNAL: IEEE transactions on radiation and plasma medical sciences

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Development of a PET system capable ofin-situimaging requires a design that can accommodate the proton treatment beam nozzle. Among the several PET instrumentation approaches developed thus far, the dual-panel PET scanner is often used as it is simpler to develop and integrate within the proton therapy gantry. Partial-angle coverage of these systems can however lead to limited-angle artefacts in the reconstructed PET image. We have previously demonstrated via simulations that time-of-flight (TOF) reconstruction reduces the artifacts accompanying limited-angle data, and permits proton range measurement with 1-2 mm accuracy and precision. In this work we show measured results from a small proof-of-concept dual-panel PET system that uses TOF information to reconstruct PET data acquired after proton irradiation. The PET scanner comprises of two detector modules, each comprised of an array of 4×4×30 mm3lanthanum bromide scintillator. Measurements are performed with an oxygen-rich gel-water, an adipose tissue equivalent material, andin vitrotissue phantoms. For each phantom measurement, 2 Gy dose was deposited using 54 - 100 MeV proton beams. For each phantom, a Monte Carlo simulation generating the expected distribution of PET isotope from the corresponding proton irradiation was also performed. Proton range was calculated by drawing multiple depth-profiles over a central region encompassing the proton dose deposition. For each profile, proton range was calculated using two techniques (a) 50% pick-off from the distal edge of the profile, and (b) comparing the measured and Monte Carlo profile to minimize the absolute sum of differences over the entire profile. A 10 min PET acquisition acquired with minimal delay post proton-irradiation is compared with a 10 min PET scan acquired after a 20 min delay. Measurements show that PET acquisition with minimal delay is necessary to collect15O signal, and maximize11C signal collection with a short PET acquisition. In comparison with the 50% pick-off technique, the shift technique is more robust and offers better precision in measuring the proton range for the different phantoms. Range measurements from PET images acquired with minimal delay, and the shift technique demonstrate the ability to achieve <1.5 mm accuracy and precision in estimating proton range.

TITLE: Aortitis: An Unusual Inflammatory Complication of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus

AUTHORS: Juan Camilo Santacruz, John Dario Londoño, Uriel Panqueva, Francy Cuervo

JOURNAL: Cureus

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease that can involve any organ system. Vasculitides are classified according to the predominant vessel involved such as large vessel, medium vessel, or small vessel vasculitis. Of these, Takayasu arteritis, Behcet's disease, relapsing polychondritis, and immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4)-related disease predominantly involve large vessels. The most common form of vasculitis seen in SLE is small vessel vasculitis. Aortitis in SLE is an extremely rare complication. This is a case report of a 21-year-old female patient with a history of SLE with overlap syndrome of primary biliary cirrhosis and autoimmune hepatitis associated with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), who presented with a one-week history of left-back burning lumbar pain, radiating to the flank, which increased with changes in position associated with intermittent claudication. In the angiography images and the positron emission tomography (PET) scan, a hypometabolic left para-aortic oval image was noted, corresponding to the presence of a contained hematoma in an abdominal aorta rupture. Later, she underwent vascular surgery and hemodynamics, performing thoracoabdominal aortic reconstruction together with aortorenal bypass and left nephrectomy. Pathology fundings of the left kidney correspond with class IV lupus nephritis, and the resection sample of the thoracoabdominal aneurysm showed a marked thinning and fragmentation of elastic fibers, areas of fibrosis of the wall with severe IgG4 negative lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate in the immunohistochemical study, establishing the diagnosis of aortitis.

TITLE: NEMA characterization of the SAFIR prototype PET insert

AUTHORS: Parisa Khateri, Werner Lustermann, Christian Ritzer, Charalampos Tsoumpas, Günther Dissertori

JOURNAL: EJNMMI physics

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Background: The SAFIR prototype insert is a preclinical Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scanner built to acquire dynamic images simultaneously with a 7 T Bruker Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scanner. The insert is designed to perform with an excellent coincidence resolving time of 194 ps Full Width Half Maximum (FWHM) and an energy resolution of 13.8% FWHM. These properties enable it to acquire precise quantitative images at activities as high as 500 MBq suitable for studying fast biological processes within short time frames (< 5 s). In this study, the performance of the SAFIR prototype insert is evaluated according to the NEMA NU 4-2008 standard while the insert is inside the MRI without acquiring MRI data.

Results: Applying an energy window of 391-601 keV and a coincidence time window of 500 ps the following results are achieved. The average spatial resolution at 5 mm radial offset is 2.6 mm FWHM when using the Filtered Backprojection 3D Reprojection (FBP3DRP) reconstruction method, improving to 1.2 mm when using the Maximum Likelihood Expectation Maximization (MLEM) method. The peak sensitivity at the center of the scanner is 1.06%. The Noise Equivalent count Rate (NECR) is 799 kcps at the highest measured activity of 537 MBq for the mouse phantom and 121 kcps at the highest measured activity of 624 MBq for the rat phantom. The NECR peak is not yet reached for any of the measurements. The scatter fractions are 10.9% and 17.8% for the mouse and rat phantoms, respectively. The uniform region of the image quality phantom has a 3.0% STD, with a 4.6% deviation from the expected number of counts per voxel. The spill-over ratios for the water and air chambers are 0.18 and 0.17, respectively.

Conclusions: The results satisfy all the requirements initially considered for the insert, proving that the SAFIR prototype insert can obtain dynamic images of small rodents at high activities ([Formula: see text] 500 MBq) with a high sensitivity and an excellent count-rate performance.

TITLE: Phantom study and clinical application of total-body 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging: How to use small voxel imaging better?

AUTHORS: Chi Qi, Xiuli Sui, Haojun Yu, Siyang Wang, Yan Hu, Hongyan Sun, Xinlan Yang, Yihan Wang, Yun Zhou, Hongcheng Shi

JOURNAL: EJNMMI physics

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Background: Conventional PET/CT imaging reconstruction is typically performed using voxel size of 3.0-4.0 mm in three axes. It is hypothesized that a smaller voxel sizes could improve the accuracy of small lesion detection. This study aims to explore the advantages and conditions of small voxel imaging on clinical application.

Methods: Both NEMA IQ phantom and 30 patients with an injected dose of 3.7 MBq/kg were scanned using a total-body PET/CT (uEXPLORER). Images were reconstructed using matrices of 192 × 192, 512 × 512, and 1024 × 1024 with scanning duration of 3 min, 5 min, 8 min, and 10 min, respectively.

Results: In the phantom study, the contrast recovery coefficient reached the maximum in matrix group of 512 × 512, and background variability increased as voxel size decreased. In the clinical study, SUVmax, SD, and TLR increased, while SNR decreased as the voxel size decreased. When the scanning duration increased, SNR increased, while SUVmax, SD, and TLR decreased. The SUVmeanwas more reluctant to the changes in imaging matrix and scanning duration. The mean subjective scores for all 512 × 512 groups and 1024 × 1024 groups (scanning duration ≥ 8 min) were over three points. One false-positive lesion was found in groups of 512 × 512 with scanning duration of 3 min, 1024 × 1024 with 3 min and 5 min, respectively. Meanwhile, the false-negative lesions found in group of 192 × 192 with duration of 3 min and 5 min, 512 × 512 with 3 min and 1024 × 1024 with 3 min and 5 min were 5, 4, 1, 4, and 1, respectively. The reconstruction time and storage space occupation were significantly increased as the imaging matrix increased.

Conclusions: PET/CT imaging with smaller voxel can improve SUVmaxand TLR of lesions, which is advantageous for the diagnosis of small or hypometabolic lesions if with sufficient counts. With an18F-FDG injection dose of 3.7 MBq/kg, uEXPLORER PET/CT imaging using matrix of 512 × 512 with 5 min or 1024 × 1024 with 8 min can meet the image requirements for clinical use.

TITLE: Theranostics: The Role of Quantitative Nuclear Medicine Imaging

AUTHORS: Arda Könik, Joseph A O'Donoghue, Richard L Wahl, Michael M Graham, Annick D Van den Abbeele

JOURNAL: Seminars in radiation oncology

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Theranostics is a precision medicine discipline that integrates diagnostic nuclear medicine imaging with radionuclide therapy in a manner that provides both a tumor phenotype and personalized therapy to patients with cancer using radiopharmaceuticals aimed at the same target-specific biological pathway or receptor. The aim of quantitative nuclear medicine imaging is to plan the alpha or beta-emitting therapy based on an accurate 3-dimensional representation of the in-vivo distribution of radioactivity concentration within the tumor and normal organs/tissues in a noninvasive manner. In general, imaging may be either based on positron emission tomography (PET) or single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) invariably in combination with X-ray CT (PET/CT; SPECT/CT) or, to a much lesser extent, MRI. PET and SPECT differ in terms of the radionuclides and physical processes that give rise to the emission of high energy photons, as well as the sets of technologies involved in their detection. Using a variety of standardized quantitative parameters, system calibration, patient preparation, imaging acquisition and reconstruction protocols, and image analysis protocols, an accurate quantification of the tracer distribution can be obtained, which helps prescribe the therapeutic dose for each patient.

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: To develop a deep learning approach that enables ultra-low-dose, 1% of the standard clinical dosage (3 MBq/kg), ultrafast whole-body PET reconstruction in cancer imaging.

Materials and methods: In this Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-compliant study, serial fluorine 18-labeled fluorodeoxyglucose PET/MRI scans of pediatric patients with lymphoma were retrospectively collected from two cross-continental medical centers between July 2015 and March 2020. Global similarity between baseline and follow-up scans was used to develop Masked-LMCTrans, a longitudinal multimodality coattentional convolutional neural network (CNN) transformer that provides interaction and joint reasoning between serial PET/MRI scans from the same patient. Image quality of the reconstructed ultra-low-dose PET was evaluated in comparison with a simulated standard 1% PET image. The performance of Masked-LMCTrans was compared with that of CNNs with pure convolution operations (classic U-Net family), and the effect of different CNN encoders on feature representation was assessed. Statistical differences in the structural similarity index measure (SSIM), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), and visual information fidelity (VIF) were assessed by two-sample testing with the Wilcoxon signed rankttest.

Results: The study included 21 patients (mean age, 15 years ± 7 [SD]; 12 female) in the primary cohort and 10 patients (mean age, 13 years ± 4; six female) in the external test cohort. Masked-LMCTrans-reconstructed follow-up PET images demonstrated significantly less noise and more detailed structure compared with simulated 1% extremely ultra-low-dose PET images. SSIM, PSNR, and VIF were significantly higher for Masked-LMCTrans-reconstructed PET (P< .001), with improvements of 15.8%, 23.4%, and 186%, respectively.

Conclusion: Masked-LMCTrans achieved high image quality reconstruction of 1% low-dose whole-body PET images.Keywords:Pediatrics, PET, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Dose ReductionSupplemental material is available for this article.© RSNA, 2023.

JOURNAL: The Prostate

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Objectives: PET-based radiomic metrics are increasingly utilized as predictive image biomarkers. However, the repeatability of radiomic features on PET has not been assessed in a test-retest setting. The prostate-specific membrane antigen-targeted compound18F-DCFPyL is a high-affinity, high-contrast PET agent that we utilized in a test-retest cohort of men with metastatic prostate cancer (PC).

Methods: Data of 21 patients enrolled in a prospective clinical trial with histologically proven PC underwent two18F-DCFPyL PET scans within 7 days, using identical acquisition and reconstruction parameters. Sites of disease were segmented and a set of 29 different radiomic parameters were assessed on both scans. We determined repeatability of quantification by using Pearson's correlations, within-subject coefficient of variation (wCOV), and Bland-Altman analysis.

Results: In total, 230 lesions (177 bone, 38 lymph nodes, 15 others) were assessed on both scans. For all investigated radiomic features, a broad range of inter-scan correlation was found (r, 0.07-0.95), with acceptable reproducibility for entropy and homogeneity (wCOV, 16.0% and 12.7%, respectively). On Bland-Altman analysis, no systematic increase or decrease between the scans was observed for either parameter (±1.96 SD: 1.07/-1.30, 0.23/-0.18, respectively). The remaining 27 tested radiomic metrics, however, achieved unacceptable high wCOV (≥21.7%).

Conclusion: Many common radiomic features derived from a test-retest PET study had poor repeatability. Only Entropy and homogeneity achieved good repeatability, supporting the notion that those image biomarkers may be incorporated in future clinical trials. Those radiomic features based on high frequency aspects of images appear to lack the repeatability on PET to justify further study.

TITLE: Ultra-low-activity total-body dynamic PET imaging allows equal performance to full-activity PET imaging for investigating kinetic metrics of 18F-FDG in healthy volunteers

AUTHORS: Guobing Liu, Pengcheng Hu, Haojun Yu, Hui Tan, Yiqiu Zhang, Hongyan Yin, Yan Hu, Jianying Gu, Hongcheng Shi

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: To investigate the feasibility of ultra-low-activity total-body positron emission tomography (PET) dynamic imaging for quantifying kinetic metrics of 2-[18F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (18F-FDG) in normal organs and to verify its clinical relevance with full-activity imaging.

Methods: Dynamic total-body PET imaging was performed in 20 healthy volunteers, with eight using full activity (3.7 MBq/kg) of18F-FDG and 12 using 10× activity reduction (0.37 MBq/kg). Image contrast, in terms of liver-to-muscle ratio (LMR), liver-to-blood ratio (LBR), and blood-to-muscle ratio (BMR) of radioactivity concentrations were assessed. A two-tissue compartment model was fitted to the time-to-activity curves in organs based on regions of interest (ROIs) delineation using PMOD, and constant rates (k1, k2, and k3) were generated. Kinetic constants, corresponding coefficients of variance (CoVs), image contrast, radiation dose, prompt counts, and data size were compared between full- and low-activity groups.

Results: All constant rates, corresponding CoVs, and image contrast in different organs were comparable with none significant differences between full- and ultra-low-activity groups. PET images in the ultra-low-activity group generated significantly lower effective radiation dose (median, 0.419 vs. 4.886 mSv, P < 0.001), reduced prompt counts (median, 2.79 vs. 55.68 billion, P < 0.001), and smaller data size (median, 71.11 vs. 723.18 GB, P < 0.001).

Conclusion: Total-body dynamic PET imaging using 10× reduction of injected activity could achieve relevant kinetic metrics of18F-FDG and comparable image contrast with full-activity imaging. Activity reduction results in significant decrease of radiation dose and data size, rendering it more acceptable and easier for data reconstruction, transmission, and storage for clinical practice.

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Approaches and techniques used for diagnostic prostate biopsy have undergone considerable evolution over the past few decades: from the original finger-guided techniques to the latest MRI-directed strategies, from aspiration cytology to tissue core sampling, and from transrectal to transperineal approaches. In particular, increased adoption of transperineal biopsy approaches have led to reduced infectious complications and improved antibiotic stewardship. Furthermore, as image fusion has become integral, these novel techniques could be incorporated into prostate biopsy methods in the future, enabling 3D-ultrasonography fusion reconstruction, molecular targeting based on PET imaging and autonomous robotic-assisted biopsy.

Phantom data were acquired using 16 PET/CT scanners (including 3 PET/CT scanners with a silicon photomultiplier detector). PET images obtained using 30-min/bed scans for optimum harmonization filter calculations and using 90-180-s/bed scans for SUV validation under clinical conditions were obtained. Time of flight and a reconstruction method with point-spread function correction were allowed. The optimal full width at half maximum of the 3D-Gaussian filter that minimizes the root mean square error with the median value of the JSNM harmonization range was calculated semi-automatically. The SUVmax and the SUVpeak of the hot spheres were measured, and the inter-scanner coefficient of variation (COV) was calculated before and after harmonization. The harmonization filter was applied to 11 of the 15 PET/CT scanners in which the SUV calibration accuracy had been verified, but not in the remaining 4 scanners. Under noiseless conditions before harmonization, the inter-scanner COVs of the SUVmax and the SUVpeak were as high as 21.57% and 12.20%, respectively, decreasing to 8.79% and 5.73% after harmonization, respectively. Harmonization brought the SUVmax of all the hot spheres to within the harmonization range. Even under clinical conditions affected by image noise, the inter-scanner COVs for the SUVmax and SUVpeak were as high as 8.83% and 5.18% after harmonization, respectively. By applying an optimal harmonization filter that is calculated semi-automatically, the harmonization of SUVs according to the JSNM strategy is possible in multicenter studies, thereby reducing inter-scanner COVs.

TITLE: Clinical feasibility and impact of fully automated multiparametric PET imaging using direct Patlak reconstruction: evaluation of 103 dynamic whole-body 18F-FDG PET/CT scans

AUTHORS: André H Dias, Mette F Pedersen, Helle Danielsen, Ole L Munk, Lars C Gormsen

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Functional imaging by standard whole-body (WB)18F-flurodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) is an integrated part of disease diagnostics. Recently, a clinical dynamic whole-body (D-WB) FDG PET/CT scanning protocols has been developed allowing for quantitative imaging of tissue metabolic rate of FDG (MRFDG). It was the purpose of this retrospective study to evaluate whether MRFDGimaging is feasible in a clinical setting and whether it improves lesion detectability.

Methods: One hundred nine patients representing a broad range of referral indications for FDG PET/CT were invited to undergo a D-WB FDG PET/CT scan. Two sets of images were produced: parametric images and standard static SUV images. Both sets of images were reviewed visually, and 310 individual lesions were quantitatively analysed using the target-to-background (TBR) and contrast-to-noise (CNR) metrics.

Results: One hundred three out of 109 patients completed the D-WB FDG PET/CT scan. There was no difference in the number of pathological lesions identified visually on the MRFDGand the SUV images, whereas MRFDGimages yielded 4 fewer false positives than the SUV images. Quantitatively, MRFDGTBR was significantly higher than SUV TBR in 299/310 lesions, and better MRFDGCNR was found to facilitate the challenging reading of lesions with low SUV TBR.

Conclusion: D-WB FDG PET/CT is feasible in a clinical setting and produces MRFDGimages of good visual quality and superior lesion contrast. In addition, MRFDGimages complement the standard SUV images providing better quantification and enhanced image reading. However, although MRFDGalso reduced the number of false-positive findings, no additional malignant lesions were identified. The technique therefore appears to be best suited for select patient groups or possibly treatment response evaluation.

ABSTRACT:
Meta-[123I]iodobenzylguanidine ([123I]MIBG) scintigraphy with SPECT/CT is the standard of care for diagnosing and monitoring neuroblastoma. Replacing [123I]MIBG with the new PET tracer meta-[18F]fluorobenzylguanidine ([18F]MFBG) and further improving sensitivity and reducing noise in a new long-axial-field-of-view (LAFOV) PET/CT scanner enable increased image quality and a faster acquisition time, allowing examinations to be performed without sedation or general anesthesia (GA). Focusing on feasibility, we present our first experience with [18F]MFBG LAFOV PET/CT and compare it with [123I]MIBG scintigraphy plus SPECT/CT for imaging in neuroblastoma in children.Methods:A pilot of our prospective, single-center study recruited children with neuroblastoma who were referred for [123I]MIBG scintigraphy with SPECT/CT. Within 1 wk of [123I]MIBG scintigraphy and SPECT/low-dose CT, [18F]MFBG LAFOV PET/ultra-low-dose CT was performed 1 h after injection (1.5-3 MBq/kg) without sedation or GA, in contrast to the 24-h postinjection interval needed for scanning with [123I]MIBG, the 2- to 2.5-h acquisition time, and the GA often needed in children less than 6 y old. Based on the spirocyclic iodonium-ylide precursor, [18F]MFBG was produced in a fully automated good manufacturing practice-compliant procedure. We present the feasibility of the study.Results:In the first paired scans of the first 10 children included (5 at diagnosis, 2 during treatment, 2 during surveillance, and 1 at relapse), [18F]MFBG PET/CT scan showed a higher number of radiotracer-avid lesions in 80% of the cases and an equal number of lesions in 20% of the cases. The SIOPEN score was higher in 50% of the cases, and the Curie score was higher in 70% of the cases. In particular, intraspinal, retroperitoneal lymph node, and bone marrow involvement was diagnosed with much higher precision. None of the children (median age, 1.6 y; range, 0.1-7.9 y) had sedation or GA during the PET procedure, whereas 80% had GA during [123I]MIBG scintigraphy with SPECT/CT. A PET acquisition time of only 2 min without motion artifacts was the data requirement of the 10-min acquisition time for reconstruction to provide a clinically useful image.Conclusion:This pilot study demonstrates the feasibility of performing [18F]MFBG LAFOV PET/CT for imaging of neuroblastoma. Further, an increased number of radiotracer-avid lesions, an increased SIOPEN score, and an increased Curie score were seen on [18F]MFBG LAFOV PET/CT compared with [123I]MIBG scintigraphy with SPECT/CT, and GA and sedation was avoided in all patients. Thus, with a 1-d protocol, a significantly shorter scan time, a higher sensitivity, and the avoidance of GA and sedation, [18F]MFBG LAFOV PET/CT shows promise for future staging and response assessment and may also have a clinical impact on therapeutic decision-making for children with neuroblastoma.

ABSTRACT:
Background: Positron emission tomography (PET) has had a transformative impact on oncological and neurological applications. However, still much of PET's potential remains untapped with limitations primarily driven by low spatial resolution, which severely hampers accurate quantitative PET imaging via the partial volume effect (PVE).

Purpose: We present experimental results of a practical and cost-effective ultra-high resolution brain-dedicated PET scanner, using our depth-encoding Prism-PET detectors arranged along a compact and conformal gantry, showing substantial reduction in PVE and accurate radiotracer uptake quantification in small regions.

Methods: The decagon-shaped prototype scanner has a long diameter of 38.5 cm, a short diameter of 29.1 cm, and an axial field-of-view (FOV) of 25.5 mm with a single ring of 40 Prism-PET detector modules. Each module comprises a 16 × 16 array of 1.5 × 1.5 × 20-mm3lutetium yttrium oxyorthosillicate (LYSO) scintillator crystals coupled 4-to-1 to an 8 × 8 array of silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) pixels on one end and to a prismatoid light guide array on the opposite end. The scanner's performance was evaluated by measuring depth-of-interaction (DOI) resolution, energy resolution, timing resolution, spatial resolution, sensitivity, and image quality of ultra-micro Derenzo and three-dimensional (3D) Hoffman brain phantoms.

Results: The full width at half maximum (FWHM) DOI, energy, and timing resolutions of the scanner are 2.85 mm, 12.6%, and 271 ps, respectively. Not considering artifacts due to mechanical misalignment of detector blocks, the intrinsic spatial resolution is 0.89-mm FWHM. Point source images reconstructed with 3D filtered back-projection (FBP) show an average spatial resolution of 1.53-mm FWHM across the entire FOV. The peak absolute sensitivity is 1.2% for an energy window of 400-650 keV. The ultra-micro Derenzo phantom study demonstrates the highest reported spatial resolution performance for a human brain PET scanner with perfect reconstruction of 1.00-mm diameter hot-rods. Reconstructed images of customized Hoffman brain phantoms prove that Prism-PET enables accurate radiotracer uptake quantification in small brain regions (2-3 mm).

Conclusions: Prism-PET will substantially strengthen the utility of quantitative PET in neurology for early diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases, and in neuro-oncology for improved management of both primary and metastatic brain tumors.

TITLE: An extended bore length solid-state digital-BGO PET/CT system: design, preliminary experience, and performance characteristics

AUTHORS: John A Kennedy, Tala Palchan-Hazan, Quentin Maronnier, Olivier Caselles, Frédéric Courbon, Moshe Levy, Zohar Keidar

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: A solid-state PET/CT system uses bismuth germanium oxide (BGO) scintillating crystals coupled to silicon photomultipliers over an extended 32 cm axial field-of-view (FOV) to provide high spatial resolution and very high sensitivity. Performance characteristics were determined for this digital-BGO system, including NEMA and EARL standards.

Methods: Spatial resolution, scatter fraction (SF), noise equivalent count rate (NECR), sensitivity, count rate accuracy, and image quality (IQ) were evaluated for the digital-BGO system as per NEMA NU 2-2018, at 2 sites of first clinical install. System energy resolution was measured. Bayesian penalized-likelihood reconstruction (BPL) was used for IQ. EARL Standards 2 studies were reconstructed by BPL combined with a contrast-enhancing deep learning algorithm. An Esser PET phantom was evaluated. Three patient examples were obtained with low-dose radiotracer activity: 2 MBq/kg of [18F]FDG ([18F]-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose), 2.3 MBq/kg [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-TATE ([dodecane tetra-acetic acid,Tyr3]-octreotate), and 14.5 MBq/kg [82Rb]RbCl ([82Rb]-rubidium-chloride). Total scan times were ≤ 8 min.

Results: NEMA sensitivity was 47.6 cps/kBq at the axial center. Spatial resolution at 1 cm from the center axis was ≤4.5 mm (filtered back projection) and ≤3.8 mm (ordered subset expectation maximization). SF was 35.6%, count rate accuracy was 2.16%, and peak NECR was 485.2 kcps at 16.9 kBq/mL. Contrast for IQ was 61.1 to 90.7% (smallest to largest sphere) with background variations from 7.6 to 2.1%, and a "lung" error of 4.7%. The average detector energy resolution was 9.67%. Image quality for patient scans was good. EARL Standards 2 criteria were robustly met and Esser phantom features ≥4.8 mm were resolved at 2 min per bed position.

Conclusion: A solid-state 32 cm axial FOV digital-BGO PET/CT system provides good spatial and energy resolution, high count rates, and superior NEMA sensitivity in its class, enabling fast clinical acquisitions with low-dose radiotracer activity.

TITLE: Quantitative accuracy of radiomic features of low-dose 18F-FDG PET imaging

AUTHORS: Xin Gao, Ivan W K Tham, Jianhua Yan

JOURNAL: Translational cancer research

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Background: 18F-FDG PET based radiomics is promising for precision oncology imaging. This work aims to explore quantitative accuracies of radiomic features (RFs) for low-dose18F-FDG PET imaging.

Methods: Twenty lung cancer patients were prospectively enrolled and underwent18F-FDG PET/CT scans. Low-dose PET situations (true counts: 20×106, 15×106, 10×106, 7.5×106, 5×106, 2×106, 1×106, 0.5×106, 0.25×106) were simulated by randomly discarding counts from the acquired list-mode data. Each PET image was created using the scanner default reconstruction parameters. Each lesion volume of interest (VOI) was obtained via an adaptive contouring method with a threshold of 50% peak standardized uptake value (SUVpeak) in the PET images with full count data and VOIs were copied to the PET images at the reduced count level. Conventional SUV measures, features calculated from first-order statistics (FOS) and texture features (TFs) were calculated. Texture based RF include features calculated from gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), gray-level run length matrix (GLRLM), gray-level size zone matrix (GLSZM), neighboring gray-level dependence matrix (NGLDM) and neighbor gray-tone difference matrix (NGTDM). Bias percentage (BP) at different count levels for each RF was calculated.

Results: Fifty-seven lesions with a volume greater than 1.5 cm3were found (mean volume, 25.7 cm3, volume range, 1.5-245.4 cm3). In comparison with normal total counts, mean SUV (SUVmean) in the lesions, normal lungs and livers, Entropy and sum entropy from GLCM, busyness from NGTDM and run-length non-uniformity from GLRLM were the most robust features, with a BP of 5% at the count level of 1×106(equivalent to an effective dose of 0.04 mSv) RF including cluster shade from GLCM, long-run low grey-level emphasis, high grey-level run emphasis and short-run low grey-level emphasis from GLRM exhibited the worst performance with 50% of bias with 20×106counts (equivalent to an effective dose of 0.8 mSv).

Conclusions: In terms of the lesions included in this study, SUVmean, entropy and sum entropy from GLCM, busyness from NGTDM and run-length non-uniformity from GLRLM were the least sensitive features to lowering count.

TITLE: Optimization of Y-90 Radioembolization Imaging for Post-Treatment Dosimetry on a Long Axial Field-of-View PET/CT Scanner

AUTHORS: Pia M Linder, Wenhong Lan, Nils F Trautwein, Julia Brosch-Lenz, Sebastian von Beschwitz, Jürgen Kupferschläger, Gerald Reischl, Gerd Grözinger, Helmut Dittmann, Christian la Fougère, Fabian P Schmidt

JOURNAL: Diagnostics (Basel, Switzerland)

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Background: PET imaging after yttrium-90 (Y-90) radioembolization is challenging because of the low positron fraction of Y-90 (32 × 10-6). The resulting low number of events can be compensated by the high sensitivity of long axial field-of-view (LAFOV) PET/CT scanners. Nevertheless, the reduced event statistics require optimization of the imaging protocol to achieve high image quality (IQ) and quantification accuracy sufficient for post-treatment dosimetry.

Methods: Two phantoms (NEMA IEC and AbdoMan phantoms, mimicking human liver) filled with Y-90 and a 4:1 sphere (tumor)-to-background ratio were scanned for 24 h with the Biograph Vision Quadra (Siemens Healthineers). Eight patients were scanned after Y-90 radioembolization (1.3-4.7 GBq) using the optimized protocol (obtained by phantom studies). The IQ, contrast recovery coefficients (CRCs) and noise were evaluated for their limited and full acceptance angles, different rebinned scan durations, numbers of iterations and post-reconstruction filters. The s-value-based absorbed doses were calculated to assess their suitability for dosimetry.

Results: The phantom studies demonstrate that two iterations, five subsets and a 4 mm Gaussian filter provide a reasonable compromise between a high CRC and low noise. For a 20 min scan duration, an adequate CRC of 56% (vs. 24 h: 62%, 20 mm sphere) was obtained, and the noise was reduced by a factor of 1.4, from 40% to 29%, using the full acceptance angle. The patient scan results were consistent with those from the phantom studies, and the impacts on the absorbed doses were negligible for all of the studied parameter sets, as the maximum percentage difference was -3.89%.

Conclusions: With 2i5s, a 4 mm filter and a scan duration of 20 min, IQ and quantification accuracy that are suitable for post-treatment dosimetry of Y-90 radioembolization can be achieved.

JOURNAL: Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
The aim of this study is to evaluate the performance of the Radialis organ-targeted positron emission tomography (PET) Camera with standardized tests and through assessment of clinical-imaging results. Sensitivity, count-rate performance, and spatial resolution were evaluated according to the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) NU-4 standards, with necessary modifications to accommodate the planar detector design. The detectability of small objects was shown with micro hotspot phantom images. The clinical performance of the camera was also demonstrated through breast cancer images acquired with varying injected doses of 2-[fluorine-18]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (18F-FDG) and qualitatively compared with sample digital full-field mammography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and whole-body (WB) PET images. Micro hotspot phantom sources were visualized down to 1.35 mm-diameter rods. Spatial resolution was calculated to be 2.3 ± 0.1 mm for the in-plane resolution and 6.8 ± 0.1 mm for the cross-plane resolution using maximum likelihood expectation maximization (MLEM) reconstruction. The system peak noise equivalent count rate was 17.8 kcps at a18F-FDG concentration of 10.5 kBq/mL. System scatter fraction was 24%. The overall efficiency at the peak noise equivalent count rate was 5400 cps/MBq. The maximum axial sensitivity achieved was 3.5%, with an average system sensitivity of 2.4%. Selected results from clinical trials demonstrate capability of imaging lesions at the chest wall and identifying false-negative X-ray findings and false-positive MRI findings, even at up to a 10-fold dose reduction in comparison with standard18F-FDG doses (i.e., at 37 MBq or 1 mCi). The evaluation of the organ-targeted Radialis PET Camera indicates that it is a promising technology for high-image-quality, low-dose PET imaging. High-efficiency radiotracer detection also opens an opportunity to reduce administered doses of radiopharmaceuticals and, therefore, patient exposure to radiation.

ABSTRACT:
Recent advancements in medical imaging have brought forth various techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography (PET), and ultrasound, each contributing to improved diagnostic capabilities. Most recently, magnetic particle imaging (MPI) has become a rapidly advancing imaging modality with profound implications for medical diagnostics and therapeutics. By directly detecting the magnetization response of magnetic tracers, MPI surpasses conventional imaging modalities in sensitivity and quantifiability, particularly in stem cell tracking applications. Herein, this comprehensive review explores the fundamental principles, instrumentation, magnetic nanoparticle tracer design, and applications of MPI, offering insights into recent advancements and future directions. Novel tracer designs, such as zinc-doped iron oxide nanoparticles (Zn-IONPs), exhibit enhanced performance, broadening MPI's utility. Spatial encoding strategies, scanning trajectories, and instrumentation innovations are elucidated, illuminating the technical underpinnings of MPI's evolution. Moreover, integrating machine learning and deep learning methods enhances MPI's image processing capabilities, paving the way for more efficient segmentation, quantification, and reconstruction. The potential of superferromagnetic iron oxide nanoparticle chains (SFMIOs) as new MPI tracers further advanced the imaging quality and expanded clinical applications, underscoring the promising future of this emerging imaging modality.

TITLE: Development of scalable lymphatic system in the 4D XCAT phantom: Application to quantitative evaluation of lymphoma PET segmentations

AUTHORS: Roberto Fedrigo, William P Segars, Patrick Martineau, Claire Gowdy, Ingrid Bloise, Carlos F Uribe, Arman Rahmim

JOURNAL: Medical physics

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Background: Digital anthropomorphic phantoms, such as the 4D extended cardiac-torso (XCAT) phantom, are actively used to develop, optimize, and evaluate a variety of imaging applications, allowing for realistic patient modeling and knowledge of ground truth. The XCAT phantom defines the activity and attenuation for a simulated patient, which includes a complete set of organs, muscle, bone, and soft tissue, while also accounting for cardiac and respiratory motion. However, the XCAT phantom does not currently include the lymphatic system, critical for evaluating medical imaging tasks such as sentinel node detection, node density measurement, and radiation dosimetry.

Purpose: In this study, we aimed to develop a scalable lymphatic system in the XCAT phantom, to facilitate improved research of the lymphatic system in medical imaging. Using this scalable lymphatic system, we modeled the lymph node conglomerate pathology that is characteristically observed in primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL). As an extended application, we evaluated positron emission tomography (PET) image quantification of metabolic tumor volume (MTV) and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) of these simulated lymphomas, though the phantoms may be applied to other imaging modalities and study design paradigms (e.g., image quality, detection).

Methods: A template model for the lymphatic system was developed based on anatomical data from the Visible Human Project of the National Library of Medicine. The segmented nodes and vessels were fit with non-uniform rational basis spline surfaces, and multichannel large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping was used to propagate the template to different XCAT anatomies. To model conglomerates observed in PMBCL, lymph nodes were enlarged, converged within the mediastinum, and tracer concentration was increased. We used the phantoms as inputs to a PET simulation tool, which generated images using ordered subsets expectation maximization reconstruction with 2-8 mm Gaussian filters. Fixed thresholding (FT) and gradient segmentation were used to determine MTV and TLG. Percent bias (%Bias) and coefficient of variation (COV) were computed as measures of accuracy and precision, respectively, for each MTV and TLG measurement.

Results: Using the methodology described above, we introduced a scalable lymphatic system in the XCAT phantom, which allows for the radioactivity and attenuation ground truth to be generated in 116 ± 2.5 s using a 2.3 GHz processor. Within the Rhinoceros interface, lymph node anatomy and function were modified to create a cohort of 10 phantoms with lymph node conglomerates. Using the lymphoma phantoms to evaluate PET quantification of MTV, mean %Bias values were -9.3%, -41.3%, and 20.9%, while COV values were 4.08%, 7.6%, and 3.4% using 25% FT, 40% FT, and gradient segmentations, respectively. Comparatively for TLG, mean %Bias values were -27.4%, -45.8%, and -16.0%, while COV values were 1.9%, 5.7%, and 1.4%, for the 25% FT, 40% FT, and gradient segmentations, respectively.

Conclusions: In this work, we upgraded the XCAT phantom to include a lymphatic system, comprised of a network of 276 scalable lymph nodes and corresponding vessels. As an application, we created a cohort of phantoms with lymph node conglomerates to evaluate lymphoma quantification in PET imaging, which highlights an important application of this work.

TITLE: Generation of Digital Brain Phantom for Machine Learning Application of Dopamine Transporter Radionuclide Imaging

AUTHORS: Wenyi Shao, Kevin H Leung, Jingyan Xu, Jennifer M Coughlin, Martin G Pomper, Yong Du

JOURNAL: Diagnostics (Basel, Switzerland)

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
While machine learning (ML) methods may significantly improve image quality for SPECT imaging for the diagnosis and monitoring of Parkinson's disease (PD), they require a large amount of data for training. It is often difficult to collect a large population of patient data to support the ML research, and the ground truth of lesion is also unknown. This paper leverages a generative adversarial network (GAN) to generate digital brain phantoms for training ML-based PD SPECT algorithms. A total of 594 PET 3D brain models from 155 patients (113 male and 42 female) were reviewed and 1597 2D slices containing the full or a portion of the striatum were selected. Corresponding attenuation maps were also generated based on these images. The data were then used to develop a GAN for generating 2D brain phantoms, where each phantom consisted of a radioactivity image and the corresponding attenuation map. Statistical methods including histogram, Fréchet distance, and structural similarity were used to evaluate the generator based on 10,000 generated phantoms. When the generated phantoms and training dataset were both passed to the discriminator, similar normal distributions were obtained, which indicated the discriminator was unable to distinguish the generated phantoms from the training datasets. The generated digital phantoms can be used for 2D SPECT simulation and serve as the ground truth to develop ML-based reconstruction algorithms. The cumulated experience from this work also laid the foundation for building a 3D GAN for the same application.

ABSTRACT:
Objective.Time-of-flight (TOF) capability and high sensitivity are essential for brain-dedicated positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, as they improve the contrast and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) enabling a precise localization of functional mechanisms in the different brain regions.Approach.We present a new brain PET system with transverse and axial field-of-view (FOV) of 320 mm and 255 mm, respectively. The system head is an array of 6 × 6 detection elements, each consisting of a 3.9 × 3.9 × 20 mm3lutetium-yttrium oxyorthosilicate crystal coupled with a 3.93 × 3.93 mm2SiPM. The SiPMs analog signals are individually digitized using the multi-voltage threshold (MVT) technology, employing a 1:1:1 coupling configuration.Main results.The brain PET system exhibits a TOF resolution of 249 ps at 5.3 kBq ml-1, an average sensitivity of 22.1 cps kBq-1, and a noise equivalent count rate (NECR) peak of 150.9 kcps at 8.36 kBq ml-1. Furthermore, the mini-Derenzo phantom study demonstrated the system's ability to distinguish rods with a diameter of 2.0 mm. Moreover, incorporating the TOF reconstruction algorithm in an image quality phantom study optimizes the background variability, resulting in reductions ranging from 44% (37 mm) to 75% (10 mm) with comparable contrast. In the human brain imaging study, the SNR improved by a factor of 1.7 with the inclusion of TOF, increasing from 27.07 to 46.05. Time-dynamic human brain imaging was performed, showing the distinctive traits of cortex and thalamus uptake, as well as of the arterial and venous flow with 2 s per time frame.Significance.The system exhibited a good TOF capability, which is coupled with the high sensitivity and count rate performance based on the MVT digital sampling technique. The developed TOF-enabled brain PET system opens the possibility of precise kinetic brain PET imaging, towards new quantitative predictive brain diagnostics.

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: This study aimed to compare the image quality of the Siemens Biograph mCT40 (photomultiplier-based system - PMT) and the Siemens Vision600 (silicon photomultiplier-based system - SiPM) using a modified NEMA IEC Body phantom (Data Spectrum).

Methods: SiPM-based Vision600 has a smaller crystal size (3.2 × 3.2 mm vs. 4.0 × 4.0 mm in the PMT-based mCT40), resulting in better spatial resolution. Enhanced time-of-flight (TOF) timing and higher sensitivity leads to nearly four times higher effective sensitivity. The standard NEMA IEC Body phantom was modified with a 3D-printed holder to accommodate also Hollow and Micro Hollow Spheres of 15.4 mm, 12.4 mm, 7.9 mm, 6.2 mm, 5.0 mm, and 4.0 mm. Each of the three acquisition sessions per scanner included 18 time points and spanned 5.6 half-lives to assess system performance at varying activity concentrations in the field of view.

Results: Recovery curves for both systems were similar when identical post-reconstruction filters were applied. The SiPM-based Vision600 system detected smaller sources at significantly lower activity concentrations, and the variations in standardized uptake value (SUVmax, SUVA50) measurements were generally smaller compared to those of the PMT-based system. The two smallest sources became undetectable below 63 MBq and 16 MBq on the PMT system, versus 20 MBq and 6.5 MBq on the SiPM system.

Conclusions: SiPM technology demonstrated superior performance compared to PMT in detecting small sources in low-activity scenarios and provided more robust quantification results. It is recommended to use averaged SUV metrics, such as SUVA50or SUVpeak.

TITLE: A transfer learning approach to facilitate ComBat-based harmonization of multicentre radiomic features in new datasets

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: To facilitate the demonstration of the prognostic value of radiomics, multicenter radiomics studies are needed. Pooling radiomic features of such data in a statistical analysis is however challenging, as they are sensitive to the variability in scanner models, acquisition protocols and reconstruction settings, which is often unavoidable in a multicentre retrospective analysis. A statistical harmonization strategy called ComBat was utilized in radiomics studies to deal with the "center-effect". The goal of the present work was to integrate a transfer learning (TL) technique within ComBat-and recently developed alternate versions of ComBat with improved flexibility (M-ComBat) and robustness (B-ComBat)-to allow the use of a previously determined harmonization transform to the radiomic feature values of new patients from an already known center.

Material and methods: The proposed TL approach were incorporated in the four versions of ComBat (standard, B, M, and B-M ComBat). The proposed approach was evaluated using a dataset of 189 locally advanced cervical cancer patients from 3 centers, with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) images, with the clinical endpoint of predicting local failure. The impact performance of the TL approach was evaluated by comparing the harmonization achieved using only parts of the data to the reference (harmonization achieved using all the available data). It was performed through three different machine learning pipelines.

Results: The proposed TL technique was successful in harmonizing features of new patients from a known center in all versions of ComBat, leading to predictive models reaching similar performance as the ones developed using the features harmonized with all the data available.

Conclusion: The proposed TL approach enables applying a previously determined ComBat transform to new, previously unseen data.

ABSTRACT:
Background: Correct classification of estrogen receptor (ER) status is essential for prognosis and treatment planning in patients with breast cancer (BC). Therefore, it is recommended to sample tumor tissue from an accessible metastasis. However, ER expression can show intra- and intertumoral heterogeneity. 16α-[18F]fluoroestradiol ([18F]FES) Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (PET/CT) allows noninvasive whole-body (WB) identification of ER distribution and is usually performed as a single static image 60 min after radiotracer injection. Using dynamic whole-body (D-WB) PET imaging, we examine [18F]FES kinetics and explore whether Patlak parametric images () are quantitative and improve lesion visibility.

Results: This prospective study included eight patients with metastatic ER-positive BC scanned using a D-WB PET acquisition protocol. The kinetics of [18F]FES were best characterized by the irreversible two-tissue compartment model in tumor lesions and in the majority of organ tissues.values from Patlak parametric images correlated withvalues from the full kinetic analysis, r2= 0.77, and with the semiquantitative mean standardized uptake value (SUVmean), r2= 0.91. Furthermore, parametricimages had the highest target-to-background ratio (TBR) in 162/164 metastatic lesions and the highest contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) in 99/164 lesions compared to conventional SUV images. TBR was 2.45 (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.25-2.68) and CNR 1.17 (95% CI: 1.08-1.26) times higher inimages compared to SUV images. These quantitative differences were seen as reduced background activity in theimages.

Conclusion: [18F]FES uptake is best described by an irreversible two-tissue compartment model. D-WB [18F]FES PET/CT scans can be used for direct reconstruction of parametricimages, with superior lesion visibility andvalues comparable tovalues found from full kinetic analyses. This may aid correct ER classification and treatment decisions. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov:NCT04150731, https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04150731.

TITLE: CT-less Direct Correction of Attenuation and Scatter in the Image Space Using Deep Learning for Whole-Body FDG PET: Potential Benefits and Pitfalls

AUTHORS: Jaewon Yang, Jae Ho Sohn, Spencer C Behr, Grant T Gullberg, Youngho Seo

JOURNAL: Radiology. Artificial intelligence

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: To demonstrate the feasibility of CT-less attenuation and scatter correction (ASC) in the image space using deep learning for whole-body PET, with a focus on the potential benefits and pitfalls.

Materials and methods: In this retrospective study, 110 whole-body fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/CT studies acquired in 107 patients (mean age ± standard deviation, 58 years ± 18; age range, 11-92 years; 72 females) from February 2016 through January 2018 were randomly collected. A total of 37.3% (41 of 110) of the studies showed metastases, with diverse FDG PET findings throughout the whole body. A U-Net-based network was developed for directly transforming noncorrected PET (PETNC) into attenuation- and scatter-corrected PET (PETASC). Deep learning-corrected PET (PETDL) images were quantitatively evaluated by using the standardized uptake value (SUV) of the normalized root mean square error, the peak signal-to-noise ratio, and the structural similarity index, in addition to a joint histogram for statistical analysis. Qualitative reviews by radiologists revealed the potential benefits and pitfalls of this correction method.

Results: The normalized root mean square error (0.21 ± 0.05 [mean SUV ± standard deviation]), mean peak signal-to-noise ratio (36.3 ± 3.0), mean structural similarity index (0.98 ± 0.01), and voxelwise correlation (97.62%) of PETDLdemonstrated quantitatively high similarity with PETASC. Radiologist reviews revealed the overall quality of PETDL. The potential benefits of PETDLinclude a radiation dose reduction on follow-up scans and artifact removal in the regions with attenuation correction- and scatter correction-based artifacts. The pitfalls involve potential false-negative results due to blurring or missing lesions or false-positive results due to pseudo-low-uptake patterns.

Conclusion: Deep learning-based direct ASC at whole-body PET is feasible and potentially can be used to overcome the current limitations of CT-based approaches, benefiting patients who are sensitive to radiation from CT.Supplemental material is available for this article.© RSNA, 2020.

TITLE: SAFIR-I: first NEMA NU 4-2008-based performance characterization

AUTHORS: Pascal Bebié, Werner Lustermann, Jan Debus, Christian Ritzer, Günther Dissertori, Bruno Weber

JOURNAL: EJNMMI physics

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Background: Small Animal Fast Insert for MRI detector I (SAFIR-I) is a novel Positron Emission Tomography insert for a [Formula: see text] Bruker BioSpec 70/30 Ultra Shield Refrigerated Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) system. It facilitates truly simultaneous quantitative imaging in mice and rats at injected activities as high as [Formula: see text]. Exploitation of the resulting high count rates enables quick image formation at few seconds per frame. In this investigation, key performance parameters of SAFIR-I have been determined according to the evaluations outlined in the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) Standards Publication NU 4-2008 (NEMA-NU4) protocol.

Results: Using an energy window of 391 to [Formula: see text] and a Coincidence Timing Window of [Formula: see text], the following performance was observed: The average spatial resolution at [Formula: see text] radial offset (Full Width at Half Maximum) is [Formula: see text] when using Filtered Backprojection, 3D Reprojection reconstruction. For the mouse- and rat-like phantoms, the maximal Noise-Equivalent Count Rates (NECRs) are [Formula: see text] at the highest tested average effective concentration of [Formula: see text], and [Formula: see text] at the highest tested average effective concentration of [Formula: see text], respectively. The NECR peak is not yet reached for either of these cases. The peak sensitivity is [Formula: see text]. The Image Quality phantom uniformity standard deviation is [Formula: see text]. The Recovery Coefficient for the [Formula: see text] rod is [Formula: see text]. The Spill-Over Ratios are [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text], for the water- and air-filled cylinder, respectively. An accuracy of [Formula: see text] was achieved for the quantitative calibration of reconstructed voxel values.

Conclusions: The measured performance parameters indicate that the various design goals have been achieved. SAFIR-I offers excellent performance, especially at the high activities it was designed for. This facilitates planned experiments with fast tracer kinetics in small animals. Ways to potentially improve performance can still be explored. Simultaneously, further performance gains can be expected for a forthcoming insert featuring 2.7 times longer axial coverage named Small Animal Fast Insert for MRI detector II (SAFIR-II).

JOURNAL: NeuroImage

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Aim: β-amyloid (Aβ) small animal PET facilitates quantification of fibrillar amyloidosis in Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse models. Thus, the methodology is receiving growing interest as a monitoring tool in preclinical drug trials. In this regard, harmonization of data from different scanners at multiple sites would allow the establishment large collaborative cohorts and may facilitate efficacy comparison of different treatments. Therefore, we objected to determine the level of agreement of Aβ-PET quantification by a head-to-head comparison of three different state-of-the-art small animal PET scanners, which could help pave the way for future multicenter studies.

Methods: Within a timeframe of 5 ± 2 weeks, transgenic APPPS1 (n = 9) and wild-type (WT) (n = 8) mice (age range: 13-16 months) were examined three times by Aβ-PET ([18F]florbetaben) using a Siemens Inveon DPET, a MedisonanoScan PET/MR, and a MedisonanoScan PET/CT with harmonized reconstruction protocols. Cortex-to-white-matter 30-60 min p.i. standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRCTX/WM) were calculated to compare binding differences, effect sizes (Cohen's d) and z-score values of APPPS1 relative to WT mice. Correlation coefficients (Pearson's r) were calculated for the agreement of individual SUVR between different scanners. Voxel-wise analysis was used to determine the agreement of spatial pathology patterns. For validation of PET imaging against the histological gold standard, individual SUVR values were subject to a correlation analysis with area occupancy of methoxy‑X04 staining.

Results: All three small animal PET scanners yielded comparable group differences between APPPS1 and WT mice (∆PET=20.4 % ± 2.9 %, ∆PET/MR=18.4 % ± 4.5 %, ∆PET/CT=18.1 % ± 3.3 %). Voxel-wise analysis confirmed a high degree of congruency of the spatial pattern (Dice coefficient (DC)PETvs.PET/MR=83.0 %, DCPETvs.PET/CT=69.3 %, DCPET/MRvs.PET/CT=81.9 %). Differences in the group level variance of the three scanners resulted in divergent z-scores (zPET=11.5 ± 1.6; zPET/MR=5.3 ± 1.3; zPET/CT=3.4 ± 0.6) and effect sizes (dPET=8.5, dPET/MR=4.5, dPET/CT=4.1). However, correlations at the individual mouse level were still strong between scanners (rPETvs.PET/MR=0.96, rPETvs.PET/CT=0.91, rPET/MRvs.PET/CT=0.87; all p ≤ 0.0001). Methoxy-X04 staining exhibited a significant correlation across all three PET machines combined (r = 0.76, p < 0.0001) but also at individual level (PET: r = 0.81, p = 0.026; PET/MR: r = 0.89, p = 0.0074; PET/CT: r = 0.93, p = 0.0028).

Conclusions: Our comparison of standardized small animal Aβ-PET acquired by three different scanners substantiates the possibility of moving towards a multicentric approach in preclinical AD research. The alignment of image acquisition and analysis methods achieved good overall comparability between data sets. Nevertheless, differences in variance of sensitivity and specificity of different scanners may limit data interpretation at the individual mouse level and deserves methodological optimization.

TITLE: Tumor dosimetry using 177Lu: influence of background activity, measurement method and reconstruction algorithm

AUTHORS: Peter Frøhlich Staanum

JOURNAL: EJNMMI physics

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Background: Image-based tumor dosimetry after radionuclide therapy, using the isotope177Lu, finds application e.g., for tumor-to-organ dose comparison and for dose response evaluation. When the tumor extent is not much larger than the image resolution, and when177Lu is found in nearby organs or other tumors, an accurate determination of tumor dose is particularly challenging. Here a quantitative evaluation of three different methods for determining the177Lu activity concentration in a phantom is performed, and the dependence on a variety of parameters is described. The phantom (NEMA IEC body phantom) has spheres of different size in a background volume, and sphere-to-background177Lu activity concentration ratios of infinity, 9.5, 5.0 and 2.7 are applied. The methods are simple to implement and well-known from the literature. They are based on (1) a large VOI encompassing the whole sphere, without background activity and with volume information from other sources, (2) a small VOI located in the sphere center, and (3) a VOI consisting of voxels with voxel value above a certain percentage of the maximum voxel value.

Results: The determined activity concentration varies significantly with sphere size, sphere-to-background ratio, SPECT reconstruction method and method for determining the concentration. Based on the phantom study, criteria are identified under which the activity concentration can be determined with a maximal error of 40% even in the presence of background activity.

Conclusions: Tumor dosimetry is feasible in the presence of background activity using the above-mentioned methods, provided appropriate SPECT reconstructions are applied and tumors are selected for dosimetry analysis according to the following criteria for the three methods: (1) solitary tumor with diameter > 15 mm, (2) tumor diameter > 30 mm and tumor-to-background ratio > 2, and (3) tumor diameter > 30 mm and tumor-to-background ratio > 3.

JOURNAL: European urology focus

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Background: Positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) with68Ga-labeled prostate-specific membrane antigen ligand (68Ga-PSMA) may represent the most promising alternative to multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) for prostate cancer (PCa) diagnosis.

Objective: To test the diagnostic performance of68Ga-PSMA PET/CT in this clinical context.

Design, setting, and participants: From January 2017 to December 2018 we prospectively enrolled 97 patients with persistently elevated prostate-specific antigen and/or Prostate Health Index score, negative digital rectal examination, and previous negative biopsy. We also included patients with either negative mpMRI or contraindications to or positive mpMRI but previous negative biopsy.

Intervention: Patients underwent 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT with additional pelvic reconstruction.

Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: The primary endpoint of the study was the diagnostic performance of68Ga-PSMA PET/CT in detecting malignant lesions and clinically significant PCa (Gleason score [GS] ≥7).

Results and limitations: 68Ga-PSMA PET/transrectal ultrasound fusion biopsy was performed in 64 of 97 patients (66%) for 114 regions of interest (ROIs). Forty patients (41%) had already undergone mpMRI with either a negative result for PCa (n = 15; 22 ROIs) or a positive mpMRI result but a previous negative biopsy. According to pathology, 23 patients (36%) had evidence of PCa: eight (16 ROIs) with GS 6, 13 (21 ROIs) with GS 7 (3 + 4 or 4 + 3), one (2 ROIs) with GS 8, and one (2 ROIs) with GS 10. Clinically significant PCa was identified in four patients with previous negative mpMRI (25%). PET/CT demonstrated PCa in seven patients (14 ROIs) with previous positive mpMRI and negative biopsy. The median maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) and median SUV ratio were significantly higher for PCa lesions than for benign lesions (p < 0.001). Optimal cutoff points obtained for SUVmax (>5.4) and SUV ratio (>2.2) could identify clinically significant PCa with accuracy of 81% and 90%, respectively.

Conclusions: In our cohort of patients with high suspicion of cancer,68Ga-PSMA PET/CT was capable of detecting malignancy and accurately identifying clinically relevant PCa.

Patient summary: Positron emission tomography/computed tomography with a68Ga-labeled ligand for prostate-specific membrane antigen is capable of detecting prostate cancer in patients with a high suspicion of cancer and a previous negative biopsy.

TITLE: Imaging for Target Delineation in Head and Neck Cancer Radiotherapy

AUTHORS: Kenneth Jensen, Gina Al-Farra, Danijela Dejanovic, Jesper G Eriksen, Annika Loft, Christian R Hansen, Frank A Pameijer, Ruta Zukauskaite, Cai Grau

JOURNAL: Seminars in nuclear medicine

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
The definition of tumor involved volumes in patients with head and neck cancer poses great challenges with the increasing use of highly conformal radiotherapy techniques eg, volumetric modulated arc therapy and intensity modulated proton therapy. The risk of underdosing the tumor might increase unless great care is taken in the process. The information gained from imaging is increasing with both PET and MRI becoming readily available for the definition of targets. The information gained from these techniques is indeed multidimensional as one often acquire data on eg, metabolism, diffusion, and hypoxia together with anatomical and structural information. Nevertheless, much work remains to fully exploit the available information on a patient-specific level. Multimodality target definition in radiotherapy is a chain of processes that must be individually scrutinized, optimized and quality assured. Any uncertainties or errors in image acquisition, reconstruction, interpretation, and delineation are systematic errors and hence will potentially have a detrimental effect on the entire radiotherapy treatment and hence; the chance of cure or the risk of unnecessary side effects. Common guidelines and procedures create a common minimum standard and ground for evaluation and development. In Denmark, the treatment of head and neck cancer is organized within the multidisciplinary Danish Head and Neck Cancer Group (DAHANCA). The radiotherapy quality assurance group of DAHANCA organized a workshop in January 2020 with participants from oncology, radiology, and nuclear medicine from all centers in Denmark, treating patients with head and neck cancer. The participants agreed on a national guideline on imaging for target delineation in head and neck cancer radiotherapy, which has been approved by the DAHANCA group. The guidelines are available in the Supplementary. The use of multimodality imaging is being recommended for the planning of all radical treatments with a macroscopic tumor. 2-[18F]FDG-PET/CT should be available, preferable in the treatment position. The recommended MRI sequences are T1, T2 with and without fat suppression, and T1 with contrast enhancement, preferable in the treatment position. The interpretation of clinical information, including thorough physical examination as well as imaging, should be done in a multidisciplinary setting with an oncologist, radiologist, and nuclear medicine specialist.

TITLE: Utilization of Imaging Modalities in the Diagnosis of Melanoma: A Scoping Review

AUTHORS: Lucas Shapiro, Mahi Basra, Hemangi Patel, Collin Payne, Brett Brazen, Alejandro Biglione

JOURNAL: Cureus

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Melanomas arise de novo or in the context of a precursor lesion. Lesions typically grow radially and then undergo a vertical growth phase proceeding to local invasion and metastasis. This review describes the utility of different imaging modalities in diagnosis and melanocytic lesion monitoring. A literature search was performed in November 2023 utilizing EMBASE, Medline, and PubMed. The PRISMA diagram demonstrates the review process. Reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) utilizes near-infrared light to help diagnose dermatologic lesions. RCM was found to demonstrate nearly two times the positive predictive value compared to dermoscopy. The introduction of the Berlin Ultrasound (US) Morphology Criteria permitted a 65-80% improvement in diagnostic sensitivity. US with fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) accurately predicts the necessity for sentinel lymph node biopsy and lymphadenectomy, sparing patients with metastasis and prompting biopsy for equivocal lesions. Single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) is an adjunctive tool to anatomically and functionally assess lymphatic invasion. SPECT/CT improves the detection of sentinel nodes while decreasing operating time and improving cosmetic outcomes. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) with small voxel reconstruction demonstrated increased specificity and sensitivity for detecting in-transit metastases of melanomas, specifically in the limbs. Dermoscopy allows providers to cost-effectively recognize common lesion patterns. Multiphoton microscopy assigns a weight-based score based on malignant features. Optical coherence angiography captures images of vessels to help diagnose equivocal lesions. Utilization of imaging techniques may increase diagnostic accuracy, reduce unnecessary procedures, and help guide treatment plans. Additional research is needed to further characterize the utility of these techniques in order to improve the diagnosis and treatment of melanomas.

TITLE: Reduced Acquisition Time per Bed Position for PET/MRI Using 68Ga-RM2 or 68Ga-PSMA-11 in Patients With Prostate Cancer: A Retrospective Analysis

AUTHORS: Heying Duan, Lucia Baratto, Negin Hatami, Tie Liang, Craig S Levin, Mohammad Mehdi Khalighi, Andrei Iagaru

JOURNAL: AJR. American journal of roentgenology

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
BACKGROUND.Growing clinical adoption of PET/MRI for prostate cancer (PC) evaluation has increased interest in reducing PET/MRI scanning times. Reducing acquisition time per bed position below current times of at least 5 minutes would allow shorter examination lengths.OBJECTIVE.The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of different reduced PET acquisition times in patients with PC who underwent68Ga-PSMA-11 or68Ga-RM2 PET/MRI using highly sensitive silicon photomultiplier-based PET detectors.METHODS.This study involved retrospective review of men with PC who underwent PET/MRI as part of one of two prospective trials. Fifty men (mean [± SD] age, 69.9 ± 6.8 years) who underwent68Ga-RM2 PET/MRI and 50 men (mean age, 66.6 ± 5.7 years) who underwent68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/MRI were included. PET/MRI used a time-of-flight-enabled system with silicon photomultiplier-based detectors. The acquisition time was 4 minutes per bed position. PET data were reconstructed using acquisition times of 30 seconds, 1 minute, 2 minutes, 3 minutes, and 4 minutes. Three readers independently assessed image quality for each reconstruction using a 5-point Likert scale (with 1 denoting nondiagnostic and 5 indicating excellent quality). One reader measured SUVmaxfor up to six lesions per patient. Two readers independently assessed lesion conspicuity using a a 3-point Likert scale (with 1 indicating that lesions were not visualized and 3 denoting that they were definitely visualized).RESULTS.Mean image quality across readers at 30 seconds, 1 minutes, 2 minutes, 3 minutes, and 4 minutes was, for68Ga-RM2 PET/MRI, from 1.0 ± 0.2 to 1.7 ± 0.7, 2.0 ± 0.3 to 2.6 ± 0.8, 3.1 ± 0.5 to 3.9 ± 0.8, 4.6 ± 0.6 to 4.7 ± 0.6, and 4.8 ± 0.4 to 4.8 ± 0.5, respectively, and for68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/MRI it was from 1.2 ± 0.4 to 1.8 ± 0.6, 2.2 ± 0.4 to 2.8 ± 0.7, 3.6 ± 0.6 to 4.1± 0.8, 4.8 ± 0.4 to 4.9 ± 0.4, and 4.9 ± 0.3 to 5.0 ± 0.2, respectively. The mean lesion SUVmaxfor68Ga-RM2 PET/MRI was 11.1 ± 12.4, 10.2 ± 11.7, 9.6 ± 11.3, 9.5 ± 11.6, and 9.4 ± 11.6, respectively, and for68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/MRI it was 14.7 ± 8.2, 12.9 ± 7.4, 12.1 ± 7.8, 11.7 ± 7.9, and 11.6 ± 7.9, respectively. Mean lesion conspicuity (reader 1/reader 2) was, for68Ga-RM2 PET/MRI, 2.4 ± 0.5/2.7 ± 0.5, 2.9 ± 0.3/2.9 ± 0.3, 3.0 ± 0.0/3.0 ± 0.0, 3.0 ± 0.0/3.0 ± 0.0, and 3.0 ± 0.0/3.0 ± 0.0, respectively, and for68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/MRI it was 2.6 ± 0.5/2.8 ± 0.4, 3.0 ± 0.2/2.9 ± 0.3, 3.0 ± 0.1/3.0 ± 0.2, 3.0 ± 0.0/3.0 ± 0.0, and 3.0 ± 0.0/3.0 ± 0.0, respectively.CONCLUSION.Our data support routine 3-minute acquisitions, which provided results very similar to those for 4-minute acquisitions. Two-minute acquisitions, although they lowered quality somewhat, provided acceptable performance and warrant consideration.CLINICAL IMPACT.When PC is evaluated using modern PET/MRI equipment, time per bed position may be reduced compared with historically used times.TRIAL REGISTRATION.ClinicalTrials.govNCT02624518andNCT02678351.

TITLE: Investigating the efficacy of uncrosslinked porcine collagen coated vascular grafts for neointima formation and endothelialization

AUTHORS: Chao Yang, Chao Su, Jie Zou, Binru Zhong, Lin Wang, Bailang Chen, Jianmo Li, Minxin Wei

JOURNAL: Frontiers in bioengineering and biotechnology

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Introduction: This study evaluates the efficacy of uncrosslinked porcine collagen coated vascular grafts (UPCCVG) in facilitating neointima formation and endothelialization.

Methods: Prior to coating, the uncrosslinked porcine collagen underwent comprehensive characterization employing SDS-PAGE, image analysis, circular dichroism and immunogenicity. The PET substrate of the vascular graft was coated with collagen solution utilizing the dip-coating method. Water permeability, blood leakage resistance, radial compliance, hemolysis, cytotoxicity and cell proliferation of UPCCVGin vitrowere studied. Subsequentin vivoevaluation involved the implantation of UPCCVG as a substitute for the porcine abdominal aorta. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) was employed to evaluate UPCCVG patency post-implantation, while histology, immunohistochemistry, and scanning electron microscopy were utilized to assess neointima formation and endothelialization. Thein vivothrombosis of UPCCVG was analyzed simultaneously to further characterize its blood compatibility.

Results: The uncrosslinked collagen demonstrated high purity, maintaining its triple helix structure and molecular weight akin to the type I bovine collagen standard substrate, indicative of preserved biological activity and low immunogenicity. UPCCVG exhibited water permeability, blood leakage resistance, radial compliance and blood compatibility comparable to commercial grafts. DSA revealed satisfactory patency of UPCCVG without evidence of stenosis or swelling at the 3-week post-implantation mark. Histological analysis illustrated well-developed neointima with appropriate thickness and controlled proliferation. Immunohistochemistry confirmed the presence of endothelial cells (VWF positive) and smooth muscle cells (α-SMA positive) within the neointima, indicating successful endothelialization. Moreover, the morphology of the neointima surface closely resembled that of the natural artery tunica intima, oriented along the direction of blood flow.

Discussion: UPCCVG, composed of uncrosslinked porcine collagen, demonstrates promising potential in fostering neointima formation and endothelialization while mitigating intimal hyperplasia. This biocompatible uncrosslinked porcine collagen merits further investigation for its clinical applications in vascular reconstruction.

AUTHORS: Jiahong Ouyang, Ehsan Adeli, Kilian M Pohl, Qingyu Zhao, Greg Zaharchuk

JOURNAL: Information processing in medical imaging : proceedings of the ... conference

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Multi-modal MRIs are widely used in neuroimaging applications since different MR sequences provide complementary information about brain structures. Recent works have suggested that multi-modal deep learning analysis can benefit from explicitly disentangling anatomical (shape) and modality (appearance) information into separate image presentations. In this work, we challenge mainstream strategies by showing that they do not naturally lead to representation disentanglement both in theory and in practice. To address this issue, we propose a margin loss that regularizes the similarity in relationships of the representations across subjects and modalities. To enable robust training, we further use a conditional convolution to design a single model for encoding images of all modalities. Lastly, we propose a fusion function to combine the disentangled anatomical representations as a set of modality-invariant features for downstream tasks. We evaluate the proposed method on three multi-modal neuroimaging datasets. Experiments show that our proposed method can achieve superior disentangled representations compared to existing disentanglement strategies. Results also indicate that the fused anatomical representation has potential in the downstream task of zero-dose PET reconstruction and brain tumor segmentation.

TITLE: The Most Common Lesions Detected by Neuroimaging as Causes of Epilepsy

JOURNAL: Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder characterized by chronic, unprovoked and recurrent seizures, which are the result of rapid and excessive bioelectric discharges in nerve cells. Neuroimaging is used to detect underlying structural abnormalities which may be associated with epilepsy. This paper reviews the most common abnormalities, such as hippocampal sclerosis, malformations of cortical development and vascular malformation, detected by neuroimaging in patients with epilepsy to help understand the correlation between these changes and the course, treatment and prognosis of epilepsy. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reveals structural changes in the brain which are described in this review. Recent studies indicate the usefulness of additional imaging techniques. The use of fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) improves surgical outcomes in MRI-negative cases of focal cortical dysplasia. Some techniques, such as quantitative image analysis, magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), functional MRI (fMRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and fibre tract reconstruction, can detect small malformations-which means that some of the epilepsies can be treated surgically. Quantitative susceptibility mapping may become the method of choice in vascular malformations. Neuroimaging determines appropriate diagnosis and treatment and helps to predict prognosis.

TITLE: Biofunctional Glycol-Modified Polyethylene Terephthalate and Thermoplastic Polyurethane Implants by Extrusion-Based Additive Manufacturing for Medical 3D Maxillofacial Defect Reconstruction

AUTHORS: Matthias Katschnig, Juergen Wallner, Thomas Janics, Christoph Burgstaller, Wolfgang Zemann, Clemens Holzer

JOURNAL: Polymers

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
This work addresses the topic of extrusion-based additive manufacturing (filament-based material extrusion) of patient-specific biofunctional maxillofacial implants. The technical approach was chosen to overcome the shortcomings of medically established fabrication processes such as a limited availability of materials or long manufacturing times. The goal of the work was a successful fabrication of basic implants for defect reconstruction. The underlying vision is the implants' clinic-internal and operation-accompanying application. Following a literature search, a material selection was conducted. Digitally prepared three-dimensional (3D) models dealing with two representative mandible bone defects were printed based on the material selection. An ex-vivo model of the implant environment evaluated dimensional and fitting traits of the implants. Glycol-modified PET (PETG) and thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) were finally selected. These plastics had high cell acceptance, good mechanical properties, and optimal printability. The subsequent fabrication process yielded two different implant strategies: the standard implant made of PETG with a build-up rate of approximately 10 g/h, and the biofunctional performance implant with a TPU shell and a PETG core with a build-up rate of approximately 4 g/h. The standard implant is meant to be intraoperatively applied, as the print time is below three hours even for larger skull defects. Standard implants proved to be well fitting, mechanically stable and cleanly printed. In addition, the hybrid implant showed particularly cell-friendly behavior due to the chemical constitution of the TPU shell and great impact stability because of the crack-absorbing TPU/PETG combination. This biofunctional constellation could be used in specific reconstructive patient cases and is suitable for pre-operative manufacturing based on radiological image scans of the defect. In summary, filament-based material extrusion has been identified as a suitable manufacturing method for personalized implants in the maxillofacial area. A further clinical and mechanical study is recommended.

JOURNAL: EJNMMI physics

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Patient-specific dosimetry is required to ensure the safety of molecular radiotherapy and to predict response. Dosimetry involves several steps, the first of which is the determination of the activity of the radiopharmaceutical taken up by an organ/lesion over time. As uncertainties propagate along each of the subsequent steps (integration of the time-activity curve, absorbed dose calculation), establishing a reliable activity quantification is essential. The MRTDosimetry project was a European initiative to bring together expertise in metrology and nuclear medicine research, with one main goal of standardizing quantitative177Lu SPECT/CT imaging based on a calibration protocol developed and tested in a multicentre inter-comparison. This study presents the setup and results of this comparison exercise.

Methods: The inter-comparison included nine SPECT/CT systems. Each site performed a set of three measurements with the same setup (system, acquisition and reconstruction): (1) Determination of an image calibration for conversion from counts to activity concentration (large cylinder phantom), (2) determination of recovery coefficients for partial volume correction (IEC NEMA PET body phantom with sphere inserts), (3) validation of the established quantitative imaging setup using a 3D printed two-organ phantom (ICRP110-based kidney and spleen). In contrast to previous efforts, traceability of the activity measurement was required for each participant, and all participants were asked to calculate uncertainties for their SPECT-based activities.

Results: Similar combinations of imaging system and reconstruction lead to similar image calibration factors. The activity ratio results of the anthropomorphic phantom validation demonstrate significant harmonization of quantitative imaging performance between the sites with all sites falling within one standard deviation of the mean values for all inserts. Activity recovery was underestimated for total kidney, spleen, and kidney cortex, while it was overestimated for the medulla.

Conclusion: This international comparison exercise demonstrates that harmonization of quantitative SPECT/CT is feasible when following very specific instructions of a dedicated calibration protocol, as developed within the MRTDosimetry project. While quantitative imaging performance demonstrates significant harmonization, an over- and underestimation of the activity recovery highlights the limitations of any partial volume correction in the presence of spill-in and spill-out between two adjacent volumes of interests.

AUTHORS: M Hatt, A K Krizsan, A Rahmim, T J Bradshaw, P F Costa, A Forgacs, R Seifert, A Zwanenburg, I El Naqa, P E Kinahan, F Tixier, A K Jha, D Visvikis

JOURNAL: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: The purpose of this guideline is to provide comprehensive information on best practices for robust radiomics analyses for both hand-crafted and deep learning-based approaches.

Methods: In a cooperative effort between the EANM and SNMMI, we agreed upon current best practices and recommendations for relevant aspects of radiomics analyses, including study design, quality assurance, data collection, impact of acquisition and reconstruction, detection and segmentation, feature standardization and implementation, as well as appropriate modelling schemes, model evaluation, and interpretation. We also offer an outlook for future perspectives.

Conclusion: Radiomics is a very quickly evolving field of research. The present guideline focused on established findings as well as recommendations based on the state of the art. Though this guideline recognizes both hand-crafted and deep learning-based radiomics approaches, it primarily focuses on the former as this field is more mature. This guideline will be updated once more studies and results have contributed to improved consensus regarding the application of deep learning methods for radiomics. Although methodological recommendations in the present document are valid for most medical image modalities, we focus here on nuclear medicine, and specific recommendations when necessary are made for PET/CT, PET/MR, and quantitative SPECT.

TITLE: Super-resolution visualization of chromatin loop folding in human lymphoblastoid cells using interferometric photoactivated localization microscopy

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
The three-dimensional (3D) genome structure plays a fundamental role in gene regulation and cellular functions. Recent studies in 3D genomics inferred the very basic functional chromatin folding structures known as chromatin loops, the long-range chromatin interactions that are mediated by protein factors and dynamically extruded by cohesin. We combined the use of FISH staining of a very short (33 kb) chromatin fragment, interferometric photoactivated localization microscopy (iPALM), and traveling salesman problem-based heuristic loop reconstruction algorithm from an image of the one of the strongest CTCF-mediated chromatin loops in human lymphoblastoid cells. In total, we have generated thirteen good quality images of the target chromatin region with 2-22 nm oligo probe localization precision. We visualized the shape of the single chromatin loops with unprecedented genomic resolution which allowed us to study the structural heterogeneity of chromatin looping. We were able to compare the physical distance maps from all reconstructed image-driven computational models with contact frequencies observed by ChIA-PET and Hi-C genomic-driven methods to examine the concordance between single cell imaging and population based genomic data.

TITLE: Direct Patlak Reconstruction of [68Ga]Ga-PSMA PET for the Evaluation of Primary Prostate Cancer Prior Total Prostatectomy: Results of a Pilot Study

ABSTRACT:
To investigate the use of kinetic parameters derived from direct Patlak reconstructions of [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) to predict the histological grade of malignancy of the primary tumor of patients with prostate cancer (PCa). Thirteen patients (mean age 66 ± 10 years) with a primary, therapy-naïve PCa (median PSA 9.3 [range: 6.3-130 µg/L]) prior radical prostatectomy, were recruited in this exploratory prospective study. A dynamic whole-body [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT scan was performed for all patients. Measured quantification parameters included Patlak slope (Ki: absolute rate of tracer consumption) and Patlak intercept (Vb: degree of tracer perfusion in the tumor). Additionally, the mean and maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmean and SUVmax) of the tumor were determined from a static PET 60 min post tracer injection. In every patient, initial PSA (iPSA) values that were also the PSA level at the time of the examination and final histology results with Gleason score (GS) grading were correlated with the quantitative readouts. Collectively, 20 individual malignant prostate lesions were ascertained and histologically graded for GS with ISUP classification. Six lesions were classified as ISUP 5, two as ISUP 4, eight as ISUP 3, and four as ISUP 2. In both static and dynamic PET/CT imaging, the prostate lesions could be visually distinguished from the background. The average values of the SUVmean, slope, and intercept of the background were 2.4 (±0.4), 0.015 1/min (±0.006), and 52% (±12), respectively. These were significantly lower than the corresponding parameters extracted from the prostate lesions (allp< 0.01). No significant differences were found between these values and the various GS and ISUP (allp> 0.05). Spearman correlation coefficient analysis demonstrated a strong correlation between static and dynamic PET/CT parameters (all r ≥ 0.70,p< 0.01). Both GS and ISUP grading revealed only weak correlations with the mean and maximum SUV and tumor-to-background ratio derived from static images and dynamic Patlak slope. The iPSA demonstrated no significant correlation with GS and ISUP grading or with dynamic and static PET parameter values. In this cohort of mainly high-risk PCa, no significant correlation between [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 perfusion and consumption and the aggressiveness of the primary tumor was observed. This suggests that the association between SUV values and GS may be more distinctive when distinguishing clinically relevant from clinically non-relevant PCa.

TITLE: Multislice Spiral CT Imaging Localization and Nursing Care of Catheter Fracture of Scalp Vein Indwelling Needle

AUTHORS: Wei Liu, Yanhong Zhang, Lifen Zhang

JOURNAL: Contrast media & molecular imaging

YEAR: 2021

ABSTRACT:
In order to improve the success rate of scalp venous indwelling needles in infants, image positioning and nursing of scalp venous indwelling needle catheters broken with multislice spiral CT were discussed. In this method, three-dimensional reconstruction of multislice spiral CT was used to diagnose and locate the broken catheter according to the anatomical morphology of the indwelling needle, and the treatment and related nursing were carried out. The results showed that the body temperature was 38.7°C, the pulse was 106 times/min, the respiration was 30 times/min, and the body weight was 15 kg. Laboratory examination: the percentage of leukocytes was 10.00 × 10/L, the percentage of lymphocytes was 24.8%, and the percentage of neutrophils was 63.7%. Head CT examination: no obvious abnormalities were observed. 31.9% of children diagnosed with hyperfebrile convulsions had good image quality after treatment with MSCT for catheter fracture of scalp vein indwelling needle; good quality was 52.8%, and barely diagnosed was 12.1%. Multiple post-treatment functions of MSCT have important value in the application of three-dimensional localization of foreign bodies in soft tissues in children and play a more important role in the diagnosis and preoperative evaluation of foreign bodies. Appropriate nursing care for children in the image location examination has very important guiding significance.

TITLE: Design and performance of SIAT aPET: a uniform high-resolution small animal PET scanner using dual-ended readout detectors

AUTHORS: Zhonghua Kuang, Xiaohui Wang, Ning Ren, San Wu, Juan Gao, Tianyi Zeng, Dongfang Gao, Chunhui Zhang, Ziru Sang, Zhanli Hu, Junwei Du, Dong Liang, Xin Liu, Hairong Zheng, Yongfeng Yang

JOURNAL: Physics in medicine and biology

YEAR: 2020

ABSTRACT:
In this work, a small animal PET scanner named SIAT aPET was developed using dual-ended readout depth encoding detectors to simultaneously achieve high spatial resolution and high sensitivity. The scanner consists of four detector rings with 12 detector modules per ring; the ring diameter is 111 mm and the axial field of view (FOV) is 105.6 mm. The images are reconstructed using an ordered subset expectation maximization (OSEM) algorithm. The spatial resolution of the scanner was measured by using a22Na point source at the center axial FOV with different radial offsets. The sensitivity of the scanner was measured at center axis of the scanner with different axial positions. The count rate performance of the system was evaluated by scanning mouse-sized and rat-sized phantoms. An ultra-micro hot-rods phantom and two mice injected with18F-NaF and18F-FDG were scanned on the scanner. An average depth of interaction (DOI) resolution of 1.96 mm, energy resolution of 19.1% and timing resolution of 1.20 ns were obtained for the detector. Average spatial resolutions of 0.82 mm and 1.16 mm were obtained up to a distance of 30 mm radially from the center of the FOV when reconstructing a point source in 1% and 10% warm backgrounds, respectively, using OSEM reconstruction with 16 subsets and 10 iterations. Sensitivities of 16.0% and 11.9% were achieved at center of the scanner for energy windows of 250-750 keV and 350-750 keV respectively. Peak noise equivalent count rates (NECRs) of 324 kcps and 144 kcps were obtained at an activity of 26.4 MBq for the mouse-sized and rat-sized phantoms. Rods of 1.0 mm diameter can be visually resolved from the image of the ultra-micro hot-rods phantom. The capability of the scanner was demonstrated by high quality in-vivo mouse images.

TITLE: A right pulmonary vein abnormality treated with 3D CT assistance in thoracoscopic surgery for esophageal cancer: a case report

AUTHORS: Naoki Kuwayama, Isamu Hoshino, Hisashi Gunji, Toru Tonooka, Hiroaki Soda, Takeshi Kurosaki, Nobuhiro Takiguchi, Yoshihiro Nabeya, Wataru Takayama

JOURNAL: Surgical case reports

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Background: Anomalous bifurcation of the right superior pulmonary vein is an important anomaly that should be recognized not only in respiratory and cardiac surgeries, but also in esophageal surgery for the safe performance of surgery. We report a case in which thoracoscopic esophagectomy was safely performed using preoperative three-dimensional computed tomography (3D CT) imaging.

Case presentation: An 81-year-old male patient received an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, which revealed a 20-cm incisor at the entrance, 43-cm EGJ, and 30-mm large type 1 + IIc lesion between the 23-cm and 26-cm incisors; biopsy showed squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Contrast-enhanced CT showed wall thickening in the anterior wall of the upper thoracic esophagus, without evidence of multi-organ invasion or lymph node metastasis. In addition, a break in the right pulmonary vein passing dorsal to the right main bronchus and flowing directly into the left atrium was observed, and 3D CT was performed preoperatively to confirm the 3D positioning. Positron emission tomography (PET)-CT showed a high degree of accumulation (SUVmax 19.95) in the upper thoracic esophagus. The patient was diagnosed with upper thoracic esophageal cancer, cT2N0M0 cStage II, and underwent thoracoscopic subtotal esophagectomy (three-region dissection) and gastric tube reconstruction. The dorsal inflow of the pulmonary vein in the right main bronchus, which was recognized on preoperative CT, was confirmed and preserved. The pathological diagnosis was basaloid squamous cell carcinoma, pT1b(SM1)N0(0/58)M0 pStage I. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged on postoperative day 20.

Conclusions: The anomalous bifurcation of the pulmonary vein in the right upper lobe area required attention because of its potential to cause massive bleeding and difficulty in securing the operative field if misidentified and damaged during surgery. Although it is not frequently encountered, it is the bifurcation anomaly that esophageal surgeons must bear in mind due to its severe consequences. Preoperative image-reading and intraoperative manipulation of this vessel are imperative for surgical safety.

TITLE: [The influence of CT acquisition and reconstruction parameters on the stability of radiomic features of pure ground-glass nodules]

AUTHORS: S X Yang, N Wu, L Zhang, M Li

JOURNAL: Zhonghua zhong liu za zhi [Chinese journal of oncology]

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Objective:To investigate the influence of CT reconstruction algorithm, radiation dose, and contrast agent on the stability of radiomic features of pure ground-glass density pulmonary nodules.Methods:A total of 50 pure ground-glass density pulmonary nodules in 35 patients were prospectively selected from Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College in 2018. After reconstructing the original image of the same patient's pulmonary nodules, six sequences of different parameters were obtained. ITK-SNAP software was used to segment different sequences of pure ground-glass density pulmonary nodules. All scanning data were extracted by A. K. software. The radiomic features with good retest reliability were selected by the intraclass correlation coefficient. The statistical software of R language was used to analyze the characteristic parameters. All the radiomic feature values of different sequences were paired and compared. The number of radiomic features changed by acquisition and reconstruction parameters was counted. The influence of different parameters on the reproducibility of pure ground-glass density pulmonary nodules was compared.Results:A total of 391 radiomic features were extracted from 50 cases of pure ground-glass density pulmonary nodules. 320 features with an intraclass correlation coefficient greater than 0.75 were selected for further analysis. By changing the three parameters of CT reconstruction algorithm, radiation dose, and contrast agent simultaneously, the changed radiomic features of the pure ground-glass density pulmonary nodules reach 60.9% (195/320), including 6.7% (1/15) morphological feature, 100.0% (40/40) histogram features, and 58.1% (154/265) texture features. When only one parameter was changed (keeping the other two parameters unchanged), changing the CT reconstruction algorithm, radiation dose, and contrast agent respectively, the changed radiomic features of pure ground-glass density pulmonary nodules were 10.6% (34/320), 30.9% (99/320) and 50.6% (162/320), the difference was statistically significant (P<0.05). When the radiation dose and contrast agent were changed, the radiomic features obtained by the FBP reconstruction algorithm had smaller changes than the features obtained by the 50% ASiR-V algorithm (P=0.001).Conclusions:CT reconstruction algorithm, radiation dose, and contrast agent will affect the radiomic features of pure ground-glass density pulmonary nodules. The contrast agent has the most significant influence on the radiomic features, followed by radiation dose and CT reconstruction algorithm minimum. Compared with morphological features, histogram features and texture features are more likely to be affected by CT reconstruction algorithms, radiation doses, and contrast agents. Compared with the 50% ASiR-V algorithm, the radiomic features obtained by the FBP reconstruction algorithm are less affected by the radiation dose and contrast agent. The influence of these parameters should be fully considered in the radiomic analysis.

TITLE: Dynamic myocardial CT perfusion imaging-state of the art

AUTHORS: Olga Sliwicka, Ioannis Sechopoulos, Andrea Baggiano, Gianluca Pontone, Robin Nijveldt, Jesse Habets

JOURNAL: European radiology

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
In patients with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD), dynamic myocardial computed tomography perfusion (CTP) imaging combined with coronary CT angiography (CTA) has become a comprehensive diagnostic examination technique resulting in both anatomical and quantitative functional information on myocardial blood flow, and the presence and grading of stenosis. Recently, CTP imaging has been proven to have good diagnostic accuracy for detecting myocardial ischemia, comparable to stress magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography perfusion, while being superior to single photon emission computed tomography. Dynamic CTP accompanied by coronary CTA can serve as a gatekeeper for invasive workup, as it reduces unnecessary diagnostic invasive coronary angiography. Dynamic CTP also has good prognostic value for the prediction of major adverse cardiovascular events. In this article, we will provide an overview of dynamic CTP, including the basics of coronary blood flow physiology, applications and technical aspects including protocols, image acquisition and reconstruction, future perspectives, and scientific challenges. KEY POINTS: • Stress dynamic myocardial CT perfusion combined with coronary CTA is a comprehensive diagnostic examination technique resulting in both anatomical and quantitative functional information. • Dynamic CTP imaging has good diagnostic accuracy for detecting myocardial ischemia comparable to stress MRI and PET perfusion. • Dynamic CTP accompanied by coronary CTA may serve as a gatekeeper for invasive workup and can guide treatment in obstructive coronary artery disease.

TITLE: Alternative Nuclear Imaging Tools for Infection Imaging

AUTHORS: Paola Anna Erba, Francesco Bartoli, Martina Sollini, Berchiolli Raffaella, Roberta Zanca, Esposito Enrica, Elena Lazzeri

JOURNAL: Current cardiology reports

YEAR: 2022

ABSTRACT:
Purpose of review: Cardiovascular infections are serious disease associated with high morbidity and mortality. Their diagnosis is challenging, requiring a proper management for a prompt recognition of the clinical manifestations, and a multidisciplinary approach involving cardiologists, cardiothoracic surgeons, infectious diseases specialist, imagers, and microbiologists. Imaging plays a central role in the diagnostic workout, including molecular imaging techniques. In this setting, two different strategies might be used to image infections: the first is based on the use of agents targeting the microorganism responsible for the infection. Alternatively, we can target the components of the pathophysiological changes of the inflammatory process and/or the host response to the infectious pathogen can be considered. Understanding the strength and limitations of each strategy is crucial to select the most appropriate imaging tool.

Recent findings: Currently, multislice computed tomography (MSCT) and nuclear imaging (18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography, and leucocyte scintigraphy) are part of the diagnostic strategies. The main role of nuclear medicine imaging (PET/CT and SPECT/CT) is the confirmation of valve/CIED involvement and/or associated perivalvular infection and the detection of distant septic embolism. Proper patients' preparation, imaging acquisition, and reconstruction as well as imaging reading are crucial to maximize the diagnostic information. In this manuscript, we described the use of molecular imaging techniques, in particular WBC imaging, in patients with infective endocarditis, cardiovascular implantable electronic device infections, and infections of composite aortic graft, underlying the strength and limitations of such approached as compared to the other imaging modalities.

TITLE: Deep learning-based harmonization of CT reconstruction kernels towards improved clinical task performance

AUTHORS: Dongyang Du, Wenbing Lv, Jieqin Lv, Xiaohui Chen, Hubing Wu, Arman Rahmim, Lijun Lu

JOURNAL: European radiology

YEAR: 2023

ABSTRACT:
Objectives: To develop a deep learning-based harmonization framework, assessing whether it can improve performance of radiomics models given different kernels in different clinical tasks and additionally generalize to mitigate the effects of new/unobserved kernels on radiomics features.

Methods: Patient data with 2 reconstruction kernels and phantom data with 22 reconstruction kernels were included. Eighty-five patients were studied for lymph node metastasis (LNM) prediction, and 164 patients for differential diagnosis between lung cancer (LC) and pulmonary tuberculosis (TB). Two convolutional neural network (CNN) models were developed to convert images (i) from B70f to B30f (CNNa) and (ii) from B30f to B70f (CNNb). Model performance between the two kernels was evaluated using AUC and compared with other well-known harmonization methods. Patient-normalized feature difference (PNFD) was used to identify the incompatible kernels (i.e., kernel with median PNFD > 1) with baseline (B30f/B70f), and measure the ability of the CNN models to convert the non-comparable kernels.

Results: For LC versus pulmonary TB diagnosis, AUCs of CNNa vs. others were 0.85 vs. 0.54-0.74 (p = 0.0001-0.0003), and for CNNb vs. others: 0.87 vs. 0.54-0.86 (p = 0.0001-0.55). For LNM prediction, AUCs of CNNa vs. others were 0.68 vs. 0.56-0.61 (p = 0.10-0.39), and for CNNb vs. others: 0.78 vs. 0.70-0.73 (p = 0.07-0.40). After CNN harmonization, 17 of 20 (85%) of investigated unknown kernels produced comparable radiomics feature values relative to baseline (median PNFD from 1.10-2.31 to 0.23-1.13).

Conclusion: The CNN harmonization effectively improved performance of radiomics models between reconstruction kernels in different clinical tasks, and reduced feature differences between unknown kernels vs. baseline.

Key points: • The soft (B30f) and sharp (B70f) kernels strongly affect radiomics reproducibility and generalizability. • The convolutional neural network (CNN) harmonization methods performed better than location-scale (ComBat and centering-scaling) and matrix factorization harmonization methods (based on singular value decomposition (SVD) and independent component analysis (ICA)) in both clinical tasks. • The CNN harmonization methods improve feature reproducibility not only between specific kernels (B30f and B70f) from the same scanner, but also between unobserved kernels from different scanners of different vendors.

JOURNAL: Human brain mapping

YEAR: 2024

ABSTRACT:
Deuterium metabolic imaging (DMI) is an emerging magnetic resonance technique, for non-invasive mapping of human brain glucose metabolism following oral or intravenous administration of deuterium-labeled glucose. Regional differences in glucose metabolism can be observed in various brain pathologies, such as Alzheimer's disease, cancer, epilepsy or schizophrenia, but the achievable spatial resolution of conventional phase-encoded DMI methods is limited due to prolonged acquisition times rendering submilliliter isotropic spatial resolution for dynamic whole brain DMI not feasible. The purpose of this study was to implement non-Cartesian spatial-spectral sampling schemes for whole-brain2H FID-MR Spectroscopic Imaging to assess time-resolved metabolic maps with sufficient spatial resolution to reliably detect metabolic differences between healthy gray and white matter regions. Results were compared with lower-resolution DMI maps, conventionally acquired within the same session. Six healthy volunteers (4 m/2 f) were scanned for ~90 min after administration of 0.8 g/kg oral [6,6']-2H glucose. Time-resolved whole brain2H FID-DMI maps of glucose (Glc) and glutamate + glutamine (Glx) were acquired with 0.75 and 2 mL isotropic spatial resolution using density-weighted concentric ring trajectory (CRT) and conventional phase encoding (PE) readout, respectively, at 7 T. To minimize the effect of decreased signal-to-noise ratios associated with smaller voxels, low-rank denoising of the spatiotemporal data was performed during reconstruction. Sixty-three minutes after oral tracer uptake three-dimensional (3D) CRT-DMI maps featured 19% higher (p = .006) deuterium-labeled Glc concentrations in GM (1.98 ± 0.43 mM) compared with WM (1.66 ± 0.36 mM) dominated regions, across all volunteers. Similarly, 48% higher (p = .01)2H-Glx concentrations were observed in GM (2.21 ± 0.44 mM) compared with WM (1.49 ± 0.20 mM). Low-resolution PE-DMI maps acquired 70 min after tracer uptake featured smaller regional differences between GM- and WM-dominated areas for2H-Glc concentrations with 2.00 ± 0.35 mM and 1.71 ± 0.31 mM, respectively (+16%; p = .045), while no regional differences were observed for2H-Glx concentrations. In this study, we successfully implemented 3D FID-MRSI with fast CRT encoding for dynamic whole-brain DMI at 7 T with 2.5-fold increased spatial resolution compared with conventional whole-brain phase encoded (PE) DMI to visualize regional metabolic differences. The faster metabolic activity represented by 48% higher Glx concentrations was observed in GM- compared with WM-dominated regions, which could not be reproduced using whole-brain DMI with the low spatial resolution protocol. Improved assessment of regional pathologic alterations using a fully non-invasive imaging method is of high clinical relevance and could push DMI one step toward clinical applications.
